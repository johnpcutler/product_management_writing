### 8 Trends Shaping Modern Product Management

A brief post to list eight trends that are shaping modern product management.
This is based on my personal observations. Your observations may vary.

  1. **Rise of UX and “consumerification” of the enterprise**. Even for B2B the UX bar is set extremely high. “Just winging it” is not an option. Gone are the days when a PM can do double duty as an interaction designer, UX Researcher, information architect, and visual designer. Design thinking is being mentioned hand-in-hand with DevOps, organizational design, service design, and Agile itself.
  2. **Multiple touch-points.** You’re not just working on a desktop web browser. A typical product will have multiple touch-points including mobile, tablets, and even connected devices (“things”). Products integrate services from large and complex ecosystems. It’s a lot to process.
  3. **Lean Startup and LeanUX**. A focus on validated learning vs. big batches based on unvalidated assumptions. Product development is cast as an incremental learning process vs. a feature delivery process. Authors like [Jeff Gothelf](https://medium.com/u/94a2a063be85) and [Josh Seiden](https://medium.com/u/7f786c230ca9) (authors of [Lean UX: Applying Lean Principles to Improve User Experience](http://www.jeffgothelf.com/blog/lean-ux-book/#sthash.k2bQrJcw.dpbs)) stress a focus on “outcomes over features”. One of the most notable Lean Startup artifacts is the “MVP”. In its earliest incantation this was actually meant to be a Minimally Viable Product **Experiment. **It’s not truly viable to sell or market, but rather designed to elicit learnings and guide what will eventually be viable to users.
  4. **Increased customer/user community management demands. **Customers have countless touch-points through which to interact with your company. Consider the rise of companies like [Intercom](https://medium.com/u/7ca8972daf76) and others. While incredibly valuable, this can add a significant burden for already overextended product managers. An outward facing role is a necessity. But can a single person juggle that with internal facing demands?
  5. **Continuous delivery. **Teams are delivering high quality code more quickly and in smaller batches. Heavy release train management is less common. This is a double-edged sword. On one hand it limits batch size (and onerous release planning) which is almost always positive. On the other hand it increases demands on teams for rapid tactical product ownership and coordination.
  6. **Kanban and Post-Scrum Agile. **To support continuous delivery, teams are adopting new approaches (e.g. [Kanban Method](http://www.djaa.com/principles-kanban-method-0)) that challenge the traditional cadences of Scrum which in turn challenge traditional PO roles within Scrum. Accepting stories becomes near continuous. Grooming is ad-hoc based on demand. This presents a scheduling nightmares for the busy PM and further necessities a level of dedication and availability to the team.
  7. **Availability of data (both qualitative and quantitative) and ease of instrumentation. **Teams are swimming in data and new tools allow easy feature instrumentation. A Google PM ad lists the following qualification: “demonstrated ability to dive into quantitative and qualitative data and derive data-driven solutions.” Basic statistics, experiment design, ethnography, and general research methodologies are now essential product manager skills. It is becoming increasingly clear that to some extent we’re all guessing (sometimes educated guesses, but guesses nonetheless). The data side presents immense opportunities to build quickly, measure, and learn.
  8. **Expanded definitions of Agility. **There is a new focus on “whole organization” Agility vs. traditional Business/Team silos. Siloed teams require a “glue” role — aka Product Manager — to manage disparate stakeholders. Increasingly these barriers are falling to the wayside. In their place are autonomous business units with all the resources necessary for ideation, delivery, marketing, and revenue generation. The distance from the team to other stakeholders is shorter.

Below is an amazing infographic by Roman Pichler [available
here](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/romans-product-management-framework).
In pink I’ve indicated where the trends above impact traditional product
manager responsibilities. UX has firm influence in the “User Experience and
Product Backlog” sector. Lean Startup and LeanUX overlap “Strategy and Market
Research”. Continuous Delivery impacts roadmap creation and “key events” (aka
release planning / product lifecycle management). And data impacts multiple
areas.

So what does this all mean for product managers? I’ll save that for another
post. Please comment if you have anything to add.

### The System Thinking Change Agent Survival Guide

For my first post on Medium I wanted to cut straight to a topic that is rather
personal. It’s personal in the sense that I represent the personality type I’m
about to describe. It’s something I’ve come to peace with over the years but
the road has not been easy.

For the purpose of this post I’ll call the archetype **STCA (**Systems
Thinking Change Agent). It’s weird, I know, but it’ll have to do and I’ll
explain more below. I was tempted to call it just a Change Agent —the post
definitely has a change agent angle — but that wouldn’t fully describe the
personality.

For some perspective, when I was in 2nd grade I played the part of the
“Eternal Question” in our blockbuster play _Vernacular Island_. My costume was
a big question mark taped to a headband.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OrSJKFXvexqC3Mx8-TOTVg.png)

The Eternal Question

### The Traits

So what does a STCA look like? How would you pick him/her out of a crowd? If
you’re a STCA you …

  * are intense, reasonably intelligent, and move and think quickly
  * are a systems thinker. [Systems thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking) “concerns an understanding of a system by examining the linkages and interactions between the elements that compose the entirety of the system”. For you, thinking this way is unavoidable
  * care deeply about people and don’t like to see them frustrated, thwarted, tense, stressed, or manipulated. This impacts you on a visceral level, you internalize it, and you take on these struggles as your own
  * have a growth mindset, and assume a growth mindset in others. [A growth mindset is](http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2015/11/16/growth-mindset-clearing-up-some-common-confusions/) “the belief that qualities can change and that we can develop our intelligence and abilities.” You assume (often incorrectly) that people are open to change, receptive to constructive feedback, and able to follow your logical reasoning and change direction as quickly as you
  * are passionate about the truth and discovering root cause (and various techniques to do this). Cognitive dissonance is unsettling and motivates you
  * are trusting in the basic good in people (you have faith that people can “come around” eventually)
  * are social and vocal and feel comfortable voicing what you are feeling/thinking. You’re an advocate
  * a natural problem solver with a lot of persistence, but lacking a certain level of political savviness

### Allergy Test

A good test for STCA-ism is whether you have a allergic reaction to any of the
following statements. Say them aloud, and see if you get hives or your heart
rate increases:

  * “Sometimes things are just political” or “Just because…”
  * “You’re over-thinking this”
  * “I’m not sure we can trust this information with those people …”
  * (A fellow coworker) “I gave up on trying to change that a long time ago”

Did any of these quotes trigger anything? If so, maybe you have some shades of
STCA-ism.

### The Pitfalls

As a STCA, sooner or later you’ll stumble into the following pitfalls. I know
because at some point or another I’ve been there. With the best of intentions
you go with your gut, lay it on the line, and things don’t end up working for
whatever reason.

**You’ll mistake people listening to you for people supporting you. **Most people are eager to hear new ideas and fresh perspectives… to a point. They might even thank you for “challenging [their] thinking”. But this doesn’t necessarily equal support or a willingness to act on that feedback. At a certain point it becomes “too much” and the mood shifts from openness to rejection and annoyance. **Solution:** Don’t assume listening correlates with support. And don’t assume — especially with email — that the lack of response equates to tacit understanding.

**You’ll quickly find allies but you’ll overestimate the number of people who really care.** Being vocal tends to attract likeminded people. Assuming that this sample is representative (at least in terms of how much they care) can be a costly mistake. Odds are that you’ve probably made contact with the minority of people who both notice and care enough about the issue. That doesn’t mean there aren’t others sympathetic to your effort (there most certainly are) but you can’t expect people to take too many risks. **Solution:** Don’t count on reinforcements until after you’ve reached the tipping point.

**You’ll assume others care as much as you do (and care about the same things).** “Care” is a loaded word. We’re conditioned to equate care with virtue, and may even consider ourselves virtuous for caring about or advocating for something. But people are wired in different ways. I know plenty of people who care deeply about certain aspects of work (e.g. the money, the facilities, the brand of coffee) but could care less about things like customers, culture, priorities, or ways of working. This doesn’t mean they wont express some passing interest in those topics, but rather that when the chips are down they’ll pass. **Solution:** Don’t use your level of concern or values as the benchmark. If anything, underestimate interest and intent.

**You’ll misunderstand “how things actually work”. **Like most systems,** t**he deeper story for an organization is rarely evident on first blush, and certainly defies value statement platitudes and the recruiting sales pitch. It can’t be fully understood by looking at an org chart, and can be difficult to triangulate by talking to a handful of people. Who really calls the shots? What do people really care about? What happens to people who question the status quo? What is the “real” culture? **Solution: **Use your systems thinking hat! Make a concerted effort to [map organizational dynamics](http://blog.strategyzer.com/posts/2015/10/13/the-culture-map-a-systematic-intentional-tool-for-designing-great-company-culture). Carefully observe to understand the culture as expressed through actions. Be honest about what the status quo optimizes for and whether that is conducive to your proposed change.

**You’ll think you’re the only one to notice the problem.** It’s easy to assume that the problem is obscured and if people could SEE the problem they’d be open to fixing the problem. More likely, the problem is clear and known to a more people than you’d think. Some are playing the long game (see below). Some people don’t really care enough to cause a fuss. Some people have alternative interpretations and/or political motivations. Don’t talk yourself into the “problem evangelist” role. It’s a losing game. **Solution:** Test for how other people perceive the problem. Test for their current tactics and approach. Then find a way to test whether you can enlist support.

**You’ll misunderstand why other people are not speaking out.** Your fellow change agents all may have similar motivations, but you may find yourself being the most vocal representative. Why? They know something you don’t know or sense something you don’t sense. It’s important to understand and respect where they’re coming from. They may have tried getting into the ring at some earlier point and were knocked out. Accept that this puts you in a somewhat precarious “kill the messenger” position. **Solution:** Empathy and understanding. Seek to understand their resistance to being more vocal. Try to distribute the pressure for change among more people.

**Your motives will be misunderstood. **Push beyond a certain point and you’ll be easily branded as a “too negative” or “only talking about problems”. Don’t be so quick to discount this feedback as you’d likely do the same thing if the tables were turned. Recognize that you’ve likely amped up the intensity level as you try to push through resistance. You’re responding to resistance, they’re responding to intensity, and so it goes. **Solution: **Do whatever possible to avoid the downward spiral. Be especially descriptive about your motives (building trust, continuous improvement, positive change, etc.)

**You’ll get caught playing the short game.** Some people play the short game and go down in a blaze of glory (or with luck into a lightning victory). Others methodically play the long game, chipping away at structures, forming alliances, and forging change. If you play the short game then you have to understand the risks involved (an organism attacked rejects threats). This may be fine — life is too short to continue doing something that brings you down — but realize what you’re getting into. And don’t judge the “long gamers”. It’s an individual decision. **Solution:** Decide in advance whether you are willing to play the price for playing the short game. It’s a gamble. To quote Kenny Rogers:

> You’ve got to know when to hold ‘em  
> Know when to fold ‘em  
> Know when to walk away  
> Know when to run

**You’ll overestimate the power of bottom-up change. **Bottom-up change is extremely difficult. [At a certain point you hit the glass ceiling of established systems and structures.](http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/index.php?title=Larman%27s_Laws_of_Organizational_Behavior) After any period of time those structures become rigid, self-perpetuating, and extremely difficult to “nudge”. Even Herculean individual efforts fail here. So be prepared. Consider the long game. **Solution: **Be honest with yourself about the feasibility of bottom-up change. Work tirelessly to influence someone with the power to enact far reaching change. Consider the long-game.

**You’ll assume that people have the same change vision.** Even in cultures that stress continuous improvement it is common for individuals and groups to jockey for ownership of change efforts. On the surface you may see openness to change. But if you peel away the layers you’ll find competing visions for change. Realize that people may agree that change is required, but be split on tactics. In my experience this is the norm. The problem typically isn’t the problem, but rather the competition for who solves it (and how). **Solution: **Map the various efforts to address the problem. Understand who shares your perspective. Understand where there is tension.

### Now What?

I’m the last person to suggest that you become someone who you aren’t. The
first thing to realize is that your experience will be highly org/culture
specific. This is absolute key to understand. For most STCAs there is no
reigning us in. It’s an ingrained mindset. Finding the right culture and
environment is key.

Much of what you read online about change is written from the perspective of
consultants and managers. This is top-down and outside-in change and not
bottom-up change. But resistance is resistance, and it will always be a
factor. The reality is that from this vantage point you’ll do no good winning
even the majority of hearts, unless they care very, very deeply about the
cause. The only path to success — and remember that SOME people are able to be
successful — is through a disciplined tightrope walk. Without that, you may
even succeed in terms of getting the ball rolling, but you’ll have a miserable
time of it.

The hardest thing for STCAs to come to grips with is that politics, influence,
and maneuvering are requirements for change in most orgs (short of an all out
revolt, or mass exodus). You don’t have to be disingenuous, but you will have
to work the people angle.

Assume that everyone is “on the same side”, but don’t assume deep trust from
the outset. Probe, test, observe, map, and ask questions. Understand the
resistance on a deep level before confronting it. Spend time with people who
don’t share your mindset. Slow down to speed up.

  * Develop a clear vision and boil it down to its essence
  * “Be the change” in whatever way possible. Lead with results
  * Learn how to have [crucial conversations](http://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Edition/dp/1469266822)
  * Patience and persistence
  * Develop strong relationships, even with those you disagree with

That’s about it for now. Do you have any other tips? Did this resonate on any
level? Let me know in the comments below.

### 7 Tips For Better Prototypes

I love developing prototypes. I love the challenge of teasing out insights
with a[super low-fidelity
prototype](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/10/06/the-skeptics-guide-to-
low-fidelity-prototyping/). Most of all I like keeping prototypes squarely
focused on reducing risk, and making sure the process benefits the customer.

Too often I feel like the prototyping process becomes a blocker unto itself.
Competing goals muddy the waters, confirmation bias rules the roost, and
feature creep turns a throwaway prototype into a big undertaking.

Below are a couple thoughts on how to keep the prototyping process free from
bias, and focused squarely on the needs of your customers.

### 1\. Decide On A Driver

Is the prototype designed to elicit meaningful feedback? We build prototypes
because we lack decision-making information. A shotgun approach makes it
difficult to filter the signal from the noise. Consider instead building
multiple prototypes that individually address key areas of uncertainty. Decide
on a driver. Is your goal to experiment with different technical approaches?
Are you validating usability, adoptability, or business value? Prototypes
don’t multi-task well. “All of the above” is not a great answer. Stick to a
single driver, and at most a “nice to have” side benefit.

### 2\. Defeat Confirmation Bias

Ask how the data you intend to gather will ultimately change your behavior.
Most people assume they’ll “just know” when they’ve nailed a feature. Right
off the bat that thought process is setting in motion a strong confirmation
bias. As I’ve mentioned in previous posts, there is a big difference between
exploratory testing (where you’re looking for unexpected failures and
successes) and validation tests that are designed to validate a system is
working correctly.

Can you move the needle with a single, low-lift enhancement? That would be a
good one to try first because an affirmative response would be surprising, and
therefore valuable. Also, consider having someone with less skin in the game
lead the validation efforts with users. You might already be too close to your
solution.

### 3\. Throwaway Prototype?

Are you willing to throw away your prototype and start over? Make it clear if
you’re building a [throwaway prototype](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-
prototype-pitfall/) meant to be discarded, or an [evolutionary
prototype](http://www.exforsys.com/career-center/project-management-life-cycle
/the-evolutionary-prototyping-model.html) meant to be refined and rebuilt into
the final solution. The middle ground is not a great place to be. A throwaway
prototype lets you work quickly and focus on the big, risky unknowns. An
evolutionary prototype focuses on better understood features and delays
decisions on less clearly understood features. If you are juggling unknowns
AND knowns in a single feature, then consider running two prototyping tracks
in parallel.

### 4\. Simplicity

Don’t prototype a more complex feature, when a simpler feature might achieve
the same effect. Why? Even cheap complex features can have an adverse effect
on the user experience and make future iterations more difficult.

### 5\. Small and Timeboxed

Keep the team small and [timebox](http://www.techwell.com/2014/01/use-
timeboxing-boost-your-efficiency) your efforts. The value of prototyping is
that you discover information quickly and cheaply. All too often this turns
into a prototyping death march, where vague feedback triggers a never-ending
escalation of complexity, minor iterations, and increasingly vague and
misleading feedback. Don’t go there! Cut it short. Don’t expand the scope
because you lack clear feedback. If anything, remove variables. Stick to
discreet questions and areas of uncertainty.

A small expeditionary force keeps you lean, and defeats analysis paralysis. A
timebox keeps you focused, and forces you to paint with a limited palette.

### 6\. Tweaking vs. Prototyping

Differentiate optimization/tweaking from prototyping. Are you 90% of the way
there? Then by all means release your feature and tweak. Are there large,
lingering areas of uncertainty? Then continue to prototype. The team should
have a solid sense of turning the corner before releasing code to a broad
user-base. The larger sample size will help when it comes to optimizing and
detecting small differences. But processing broad feedback at scale can be
difficult. And why wait that long to root out problems that can be more easily
and cheaply caught earlier in the process? Broad strokes first. Fine print
last.

### 7\. Have A Plan

Don’t pressure teams into prototyping for the wrong reasons. I’ve caught
myself in the past using the “fail fast / learn” mantra to justify cranking
out poorly planned prototypes. The reality was that I wanted something sexy to
show customers, and that I didn’t really have a plan for testing my
assumptions. Don’t let this happen. Have a plan. Engage with your team to
uncover what is blocking data-driven decision making, and together plan the
prototype. If you are making the executive decision to “just start building”,
then at least be transparent about that.

Let me know what you think in the comments below! Happy prototyping!

### Inside My Kindle: 100 Books For PMs, UX, Entrepreneurs, Systems Thinkers,
Design Thinkers, and Other Crazies (Like Me)

I’m a product development nut. And I’m a book junkie. I love this stuff. I
recently moved to Raleigh, NC (from always blissful Santa Barbara, CA) to work
at [Pendo.io](http://www.pendo.io/), a startup focused on helping product
managers build awesome products. You can find me on Twitter at
[@johncutlefish](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish).

It occurred to me today that my Kindle collection was starting to get pretty
large. Poking around Amazon I realized that you can actually get a list of all
your purchased books. It isn’t a perfect list (the titles are cut off), but it
gives you enough information to find the book. The kicker was getting an email
from a friend asking for some book recommendations. So I decided to share the
current state of the book list with her (and you).

This covers the topics that interest me: _leadership, UX, startups, cognitive
bias, product management, Agile, management, complexity theory, marketing,
design thinking, system thinking, data, analytics, hypothesis-driven
development, product development, self-improvement, communication,
organization design, lean, kanban, collaboration, and generally figuring out
ways groups of people can continuously improve and build useful stuff_.

I’ve read each of these books. I’m a big believer that there is never a magic
bullet. None of these books presents the definitive “way”. Where there is a
“why” (and inspiration, and rigor, and an open mind), there are a host of
tools that can help get you there. Choose wisely.

# Dr. Obvious, Startup Validation, and Failure

“Validating” your startup is a big buzz word lately. Heck, all you need is
five minutes and a napkin. I think the term is misused.

* * *

### Dr. Obvious, Startup Validation, and Failure

“Validating” your startup is a big buzz word lately. Heck, [all you need is
five minutes and a napkin](http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/validate-your-
startup-idea-in-5-minutes-or-less.html). I think the term is misused.

**Validation **is doing tests for which you are trying to confirm some piece of information. **Exploratory** tests involve doing tests for which you gain value with both failures and successes. The difference is absolutely critical for startups. Simply validating commonly known information does little to produce privileged information. The real winners discover that twist: the UI that drives adoption, the untapped enterprise market, or the untested viral growth strategy. Why waste valuable resources on proving the known?

You are approaching validation (or what I prefer to call exploration)
correctly if you get negative responses (failures) about 50% of the time. In
the exploratory stage the most valuable learnings come with unexpected
failures and unexpected successes.

Why? In _The Principles of Product Development Flow: Second Generation Lean
Product Development_, Donald G. Reinertsen shows the following graph to
demonstrate that the average information generated by such a test is a
function of its failure rate:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*XRVALKugCEUqoy4O.jpg)

This should look familiar to engineers as the theoretical basis behind the
binary search algorithm, but for the rest of us Reinertsen explains:

> The equation in Figure 4–6 shows that the information content of a test
comes from the degree of surprise associated with each possible result. Any
unexpected success has high information content, as does any unexpected
failure. Unfortunately, most companies do a far better job of communicating
their successes than their failures. They carefully document successes, but
fail to document failures. This can cause them to repeat the same failures.
Repeating the same failures is waste, because it generates no new information.
Only new failures generate information.

The takeaway? At first, do more exploring and less validating. You are
attempting to purchase information, and to maximize the value of that
information you must design tests that fail as often as they succeed.

**Easy Test:** “Hand entering those receipts must be pretty painful huh?”

**Hard Test:** “Will you sign a year long contract for $22,000 if I can solve that problem for you?”

If every interview confirms your core assumption(s), then you are likely
asking the wrong questions, or you are simply eliciting “known” information
that is shared broadly and not particularly valuable. Like drug companies you
are looking to perform tests that have unexpected results driving asymmetric
payoff functions — not simply validating what is known, or failing for
failure’s sake.

For example, almost everyone finds taxes, losing weight, balancing your
checkbook, and home buying painful. This is why there are such large
industries around solving those problems. A company like
[Mint](https://www.mint.com/) didn’t need to validate that home budgeting was
difficult. Rather, it needed to validate that you could disrupt with
automation, bank relationships, take advantage of new bank APIs, and that
there was a critical tipping point in terms of willingness to share financial
data.

Some problems / pains are incredibly clear and poignant — they’ve been around
for a long time — but the solution is elusive because you’ve got an
“integration” problem. For example, take the music business. Everyone knew it
was broken. Countless startups tried to address the problem. But it was Apple
who side-stepped the integration / coordination problem.

Additionally, very few validation efforts take sufficient measures to avoid
“leading the witness”. The [confirmation
bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) is in full effect, and
we likely only hear what we want to hear. We are literally “validating”
ourselves vs. figuring how where there is an angle for a business.

Most pain is known. The trick is timing, understanding sea changes in terms of
user habits, unraveling integration issues to force disruption, and developing
faster/cheaper ways to do things. Write some scripts, stop leading the
witness, and make sure your interviews are challenging your assumptions as
often as they are confirming your assumptions.

### Life, Death, Continuous Improvement, and Continuous Disruption

I’ve been thinking about (and hearing about) continuous improvement a lot
lately. This past weekend I had the pleasure of attending my first [Agile Open
event in Berkeley, CA](http://agileopencalifornia.com/northern_ca.html). The
experience was rewarding on multiple levels. Within a couple hours I had
become part of an instant community of fellow Agile-nerds. Together we
spontaneously created a 30 session 2-day
[unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference). And the supportive
community helped me tackle topics I have been struggling with lately.

The following covers some new thoughts on continuous improvement inspired by
Agile Open. New friends [Rob
Carstons](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAAADF654BEZ7kgRiR-
xxVME4TBa2_XgL4sA4&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=rCbS&locale=en_US&trk=tyah&trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2CclickedEntityId%3A12970910%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1444631892156%2Ctas%3AROB%20CAR),
and Chris Young really helped me germinate a vague idea into something more
solid.

As Pablo Picasso once said, “every act of creation is at first an act of
destruction.” Continuous improvement exists against a backdrop of atrophy,
entropy, decay, adaptation, expansion, growth, evolution, and disruption.

Consider mitosis and apoptosis. With mitosis, cells divide and growth occurs.
When a tissue or organ reaches the right size, the process slows. With injury
(necrosis) or periods of growth, the process accelerates. Apoptosis, on the
other hand, describes healthy cell suicide. The Greek word apoptosis refers to
the “dropping off” of petals and leaves from plants and trees. When a tadpole
becomes a frog it loses its tail. Billions of cells die in our intestines
every hour. The human hand begins as a solid blob until the cells separating
our fingers undergo apoptosis. And insufficient apoptosis results in
uncontrolled cell proliferation (such as with cancer).

Continuous improvement is not a simple act of addition, and neither is growth.

At least from the perspective of shareholders, growth is key in the current
tech landscape. [A 2007 McKinsey research report titled Grow Fast or Die
Slow](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/grow_fast_or_die_slow)describes
the advantages afforded to high-growth companies:

  * They offer a 5x return to shareholders compared to medium-growth companies
  * The fastest growers (&gt;60% when they reached $100 million in revenues) were 8x more likely to reach $1 billion in revenues than those growing less than 20%
  * They succeed despite margin or cost structure

This ecosystem is extremely volatile and out of equilibrium, with rapid
technological change, cultural shifts, and cutthroat competition for
resources. Growth is the goal; it has big advantages like greater
capitalization, market share, mind share, and access to resources. But like
the human cells above, the entrepreneurial muscles and tissues we create and
grow exact a high metabolic overhead. Information flow is reduced. We spend
more to manage dependencies and integration. We must eat and digest more
resources to survive.

It’s not just about growth either: all players in the ecosystem are facing
eventual disruption and extinction (see Joseph Schumpeter’s concept of
[creative destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction)).
Every day of growth and existence involves a potential parallel path of decay
and atrophy. In this context, continuous improvement isn’t merely about
keeping our skills up to snuff, or honing the rough edges of our Agile rituals
and practices. It’s about survival. The dynamics of adaptation and evolution
are the same, but the pace is massively accelerated.

Let me present the basic model we developed and played around with at Agile
Open.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*EZrEwRg_8zTn0KaC.png)

How does this work? Let’s start out with the basics:

  1. In **Steady State** we are not improving, but we may be using newly improved capacities
  2. With **Disruption** we experience a change in the equilibrium. We experience a stressor from an internal or external source
  3. The first response is **Pain**
  4. Pain reveals information. And we **Learn**
  5. Learning leads to potential **Improvements**
  6. We reach a local optima and move to a **Steady State**

We have four primary loops with three not-so-ideal end states:

  1. **Disruption** and **Pain** predominate when we first encounter the stressor. If the stressor is large, then it leads to Death. The disruption and pain was too great
  2. If we are in **Pain**, we may continue to **Learn**. But if we can’t translate that into Improvements then we will eventually reach Death. We are stuck in a downward spiral not being able to apply our learning.
  3. When we combine **Learning** with **Improvement **we have a virtuous cycle that lets us translate disruption driven information into improvements. Eventually we’ll reach a local optima
  4. Finally, in the **Steady State loop** we can simply “ride it out” for some period of time. Without further disruption we risk descending into a cycle of complacency, and finally Death.

This cycle is experienced on the individual, team, product, organization,
industry, cultural, and multi-cultural level. Some examples:

**Individual. **We first exist in the womb, a decently safe steady-state. Birth is a form of painful disruption. We learn and adapt. Hit plateaus. And continue through the cycle. If we suffer a grave injury then we are disrupted and stuck in the pain cycle, and may die. If we get stuck in a steady-state, then we struggle with a form of atrophy and death. We work to improve our work environment until a certain point where things plateau. And if things stay there we get restless and then disrupt ourselves and find a new job.

**Organization**. After a period of smooth sailing our industry is disrupted due to an important cultural shift. If the disruption is too harsh, we die. If we live, we learn and adapt, and improve.

**Teams.** Team formation is a form of disruption. Hopefully we push through to a period of learning. We get diminishing returns from our improvement efforts. Cruise a bit. And then disrupt ourselves.

**Products. **Products are initially disruptive. We go through a period of optimization (learn / improve), and then move to maintenance mode. It is at this point that we either disrupt ourselves with a new offering, or let the competition do that for us.

In a single culture (and organization) you can have multiple parties moving at
different speeds through this loop. Consider the example of the tenured
engineer who starts getting bored due to fewer challenges, more rules, and
less flexibility. They have achieved steady state. While the company is happy
with the steady state, they are unaware that it is leading to complacency. Our
engineer starts to get an itchy trigger finger. Either they will disrupt
themselves and leave the company, or the company will respond.

Or the organization with leadership that can see the impending threat but has
trouble inspiring a sense of urgency. Or the sector within the larger global
landscape that is on the forefront of disrupting the incumbents.

With this model in mind, we can take a broader view of continuous improvement.
Let us discuss the key levers an Agile Coach could use to impact flow through
this cycle:

  * Assess the states of individuals, teams, the organization, industry, and broader culture (if working internationally). Where are they in the cycle? Do they realize where they are?
  * Preserve the safety of Steady State when it is helpful and when it help consolidate gains
  * Move people out of steady state to Disruption at the right time
  * Sense Pain quickly, soften pain of disruption, and shift quickly to Learning
  * Facilitate the Learn/Improvement cycle
  * Realize when a local optima has been reached for local improvement and push ahead

So let’s get back to continuous improvement. Gary Hamel refers to flexibility
as “planned adaptation” for the “expected” and agility as “unplanned
adaptation” to the “unexpected”. Flexibility, therefore, requires the ability
to see the future which is rather difficult. Agility assumes an unknown
future.

In the [Quest for Resilience](https://hbr.org/2003/09/the-quest-for-
resilience) Hamel writes:

> Strategic resilience is about having the capacity to change before the case
for change becomes desperately obvious. An accelerating pace of change demands
an accelerating pace of strategic evolution, which can be achieved only if a
company cares as much about resilience as it does about optimization

He continues:

> The goal is a company where revolutionary change happens in lightning-quick,
evolutionary steps — with no calamitous surprises, no convulsive
reorganizations, no colossal write-offs, and no indiscriminate, across-the-
board layoffs. In a truly resilient organization, there is plenty of
excitement, but there is no trauma.

Hamel’s version of resilience is similar to Nassim Taleb’s “antifragility”.
Antifragile systems are not merely robust — able to withstand threats — but
actually thrive in volatile environments.

With all this in mind, I want to propose a broader vision for continuous
improvement that extends beyond surfacing and fixing sprint impediments and
eeking the final 10% of craft competence out of a team. It’s the part of the
puzzle that many companies miss when they buy into an Agile transformation
only to be stymied with the next seismic shift in their industry.

Continuous improvement is the response to the drumbeat of atrophy and carrying
dead weight. And it works hand in hand with continuous disruption. Basic
process improvement and optimization relies on a repeatable future. Continuous
improvement addresses a deeper need.

The goal of continuous improvement is to, at a minimum, grow today while
remaining as Agile as you were yesterday. And even better: to increase that
Agility during growth. This is not optimization. This is resilience.

In a sense that is what Agile Open was to me personally. A bit of disruption
(a friend recommended that I attend and take the plunge), some initial pain
understanding the format and getting comfortable, learning, improvement,
reflection in the form of this post, and now I’m off to the steady-state
(bed). Cheers!


# Sticky Love — Choosing Between Physical Boards and Online Tools

I say both.

### Sticky Love — Choosing Between Physical Boards and Online Tools

#### I say both.

**tl;dr: Consider using both. Leverage online tools for what they do best.**

The [physical board vs. online tool
debate](http://pm.stackexchange.com/questions/8711/what-is-better-a-physical-
scrum-board-or-an-online-board) has been a staple of my career for 5–8 years
now. It changes form occasionally, and with each year there are new twists,
but for the most part it has remained exactly the same. I’d put it up there
with debates on wikis, ticketing systems, roadmap tools, and [chat
clients](http://bunnyinc.com/blog/communication-tools-bunny-inc-hipchat-
sqwiggle-google-sites-lost-us-slack-yammer-confluence).

So instead of repeating myself with each new instance of the debate, I’m just
going to get my opinion out in one post. Below I’ve described some of the key
advantages of physical boards and online tools. And then I go on to describe
my preferred portfolio of three physical and non-physical tools. I’d love to
hear your experiences in the post comments. What has worked for you?

Do physical boards scale? Sure. But I’m not a fan of scaling Agile (see
[Jurgen Appelo](https://medium.com/u/79df0d151f0e) and [No. Agile Does Not
Scale](https://medium.com/@jurgenappelo/no-agile-does-not-scale-
98df99da3ff3#.mv642sbw5) ). More than 100 people trying to work on the same
product and mission should descale and focus on more defined and individual
impactful goals IMO.

OK, let’s get started. By the way I had a seriously hard time deciding between
using “online”, “digital”, “virtual”, “electronic”, or “software” for non-
physical tools. So I settled on the imperfect “online”.

### Physical Boards are great for:

  * Changing workflow on the fly to meet new challenges
  * Supporting and promoting continuous improvement
  * Supporting complex workflows that are difficult / inflexible to model with tools
  * Creative customization (mission, magnets, blocker flags, etc.)
  * Improving team collaboration, communication, and interaction (for collocated teams). See Tom Wujec’s [TED Talks](https://medium.com/u/628458d920a9) on visual problem solving:

  * Include [items for UX](http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/80914/where-do-you-put-your-ux-and-ui-stories-in-your-agile-framework) (and other non-engineers) that are awkward to include in an online system
  * Team standups. The large canvas keeps the [focus on the work](http://brodzinski.com/2011/12/effective-standups.html) (also see [this post](https://medium.com/@alexander.byndyu/standups-in-kanban-style-b80b54dc1c33#.y0phv5ul5) from [Alexander Byndyu](https://medium.com/u/3e72dfc4914d) )
  * Adding upstream and downstream stages without clouding an online tool. When you deliver a feature is it truly “done”?
  * Taking [screen breaks](http://www.inc.com/neil-patel/when-how-and-how-often-to-take-a-break.html) to improve focus, creativity, and energy levels
  * Easy work decomposition (“let’s just create another card”)
  * Discovering tool requirements before purchasing a tool
  * Preventing measurement dysfunction. Not all metrics from online tools are applicable in all situations, and many are abused
  * Boards can accommodate theme, epic, and story level views simultaneously which aids in mentally connecting epics and their stories

### Online Tools are great for:

  * Asynchronous collaboration like comments, attachments, and notes
  * Integrations to third party tools (source control, devops, Slack, etc.)
  * Remote collaboration and being [inclusive to remote team members](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/243795)
  * Home and travel access for co-located teams
  * More established and stable workflows
  * Teams that can afford [extra large monitors for standups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH-pczZY8MU&feature=player_embedded)
  * Intra-company collaboration across functional teams (e.g. support, success, c-suite)
  * Automatically capturing metrics and generating reports (assuming these actually drive value for you)’
  * Work decomposition (“I’ll just type up a new card, and we wont have 200 cards up on that whiteboard”)
  * Encouraging edits to existing cards
  * Handling lots of cards / tickets

Online Kanban Board (source: <http://leankit.com/blog/2013/12/seeing-big-
picture/>)

(see also [here](http://blog.nwcadence.com/kanban-boards-physical-or-
virtual/), [here](http://www.agileweboperations.com/kanban-boards-physical-or-
electronic), [here](http://toolsforagile.com/blog/archives/762/5-reasons-why-
physical-boards-are-better-than-electronic-boards), and
[here](http://jacoporomei.com/news/virtual-physical-the-best-of-two-worlds-
for-our-kanban-board/)) for more Physical vs. Online posts

My favorite approach is something that combines the advantages of both.
Mirroring the boards feels like overkill. It really isn’t necessary for day to
day operations. But the advanced collaboration and integration capabilities of
online tools are essential.

The problem with online tools is that they so quickly become unusable and
bloated with repeated customizations. What starts with three stages becomes
five stages. Projects multiply. Views multiply. The backlog has 500 items, and
half of the authors have left the company. And most people come to eventually
hate the tool (I’ve had teams hate Jira, Rally, Fogbuz, Pivotal, Bugzilla,
etc.) [You always end up hating the digital
tool](https://twitter.com/henrikkniberg/status/256055433045880832) …

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*n2M-r4OYkMu8g6lbuiYhmw.png)

Not sure what he thinks now …

With that in mind, my favorite combination is something like:

  1. A **physical board** to promote continuous improvement and collaboration along with a [**stamp**](http://www.amazon.com/Traditional-Digit-Rubber-Number-RN018/dp/B001A42CME) to number the tickets on the physical board. Multiple teams might want to incorporate a [portfolio Kanban board](http://brodzinski.com/2012/05/project-portfolio-kanban-better-board.html).
  2. A **ticketing system** with MINIMAL customization (three ticket stages, and assigning ticket to a team member), used primarily for the third party integrations and asynchronous collaboration. I like [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira). But a ton of products will do the job here
  3. A **note-taking app** ([Evernote](https://evernote.com/?var=3)) or loose Kanban board ([Trello](https://trello.com/)) for collecting, tagging, and organizing customer feedback, notes, research, etc.

Why? Each does what it does well:

  1. **Physical Board:** Continuous improvement, effective standups, and radiating information
  2. **Online Ticketing:** Asynchronous collaboration and integrations
  3. **Online Note-Taking / Loose Kanban:** Search, organization, tagging, exploring connections (see this [wonderful video from Mailchimp’s Aaron Walter describing how they use Evernote](https://vimeo.com/89520398))

I’d throw in a good chat client (Slack maybe?), because used well it actually
reduces the number of costly distractions.

The pitfall of most tools is that they try to do too many things well. This is
the bane of most online tools after 6–12 months of use and customization.

Together these systems take advantage of each tool’s strength while avoiding
the weaknesses. A common trap with tools is that we tend to notice the
deficiencies because they slap us in the face (“I have to walk over there and
WRITE on that INDEX CARD!” or “What do you mean this doesn’t integration with
Salesforce”) while the advantages are more subtle. Our expectation is that
everything should be easy without acknowledging that most optimizations in one
direction (e.g. information showing up in multiple systems) involve a
sacrifice in another direction (e.g. sacrificing flexibility, and creativity).

The [note-taking app is an important componen](http://alistapart.com/article
/connected-ux)t because both physical boards and online ticketing systems
break down when you add 600 item backlogs. Neither are a good repository for
ideas and lack the rapid search / access of Evernote or loose organization and
workflow of Trello. Google Docs and Sheets work, but they become unwieldy with
any amount of scale.

Some tips / guidelines:

  * Again, minimal customization of the ticketing tool. Think of this as the ticket repository
  * Always feel free to customize the physical board. That’s why you’re going to the trouble!
  * The stamp is clutch for keeping track of things. An alternative would be printing simple QR codes or barcodes that could integrate with the ticketing system (using a mobile app, for example)
  * Consider taking a photo of the Kanban board periodically (1x or 2x per day) for your remote team members. Or better yet [rig up a time lapse photo](http://www.all-things-photography.com/time-lapse-photography/)
  * Open up the note-taking tool as broadly as possible across the organization. You want everyone to feel comfortable contributing
  * Consider a second physical board for roadmap / portfolio planning

That’s about it. What do you think? What has worked for you and your team?

It will not go well with your coffee. You will get distracted, and if you are
a product manager it will likely trigger some anxiety. I could have written
this in 10 posts, but I figured it would be easier to keep it all in one
place.

After bookmarking the post, please do the following:

**1.** Email it to a trusted co-worker with one of these subject lines:

  * “What goes on in a product manager’s brain …. “
  * “Before we start the next project … “
  * “This is why I need a vacation … “
  * “Answering these questions can make our engineers happy … “

**2.** Read the introduction, and then browse ten (10) questions to get the gist. Then return to it when you’re in a bind, need to reality check your situation, or want some ideas on how to give your team more clarity.

### Introduction

Let’s get started. To quote [one of my favorite posts on the role of product
management](https://medium.com/@joshelman/a-product-managers-job-
63c09a43d0ec), the product manager’s job is to:

> Help your team (and company) ship the right product to your users

Simple right? Hardly. I like to think that product helps the team (both the
immediate “doers” and the broader team) achieve a state of Flow for the
benefit of your company and users. [Wikipedia defines Flows
as](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29):

> … the [mental state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_state) of operation
in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of
energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the
activity.

Apathy, boredom, and anxiety are Flow anti-patterns. Clear goals, tight
feedback loops, and the absence of blockers are Flow state prerequisites.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*h332lIEr3yb8sR3R.jpg)

And they also happen to fit squarely in a product manager’s job description.
In short, help the team focus all of its energy on driving value directly to
the users/customers. Do “everything else”. And do so in situations that are
often ambiguous and constantly changing. Servant leadership (without the
authority) at its best.

Below I have documented 104 questions (@250 if you count the questions inside
the questions) that I ask myself during an average day, week, month, and year.
They revolve mostly around the internal facing role of product and promoting
Flow. For some of these questions, it is my responsibility to have the answer.
The team deserves no less. For others, I guide the team towards self-
discovery. Either way, the focus is on clarity, and a clear path forward.

### Team and Situation

What must I know about the team and situation before we really get started?

  1. How experienced is the engineering team? How familiar is the team with the problem domain? How motivated is the team to address this problem?
  2. Can we co-locate the team? If not, does the team have a strong track record of working remote, and are they committed to overcoming remote challenges?
  3. Is the team comfortable with ambiguity?
  4. Does the team want to be involved in the more strategic aspects of the effort? If so, what is their background in assumption/hypothesis driven development?
  5. Is the team comfortable interacting directly with end-users and customers?
  6. Is the team empowered to solve the problem autonomously? Is there typically a lot of healthy debate and push-back? Or is the team eager for someone else to make the difficult decisions?
  7. Does the team possess a good mix of viewpoints, backgrounds, and communication styles? Or do some team members exert a disproportionate influence?
  8. What is the history of the team? Are they coming off a positive experience with high momentum, or a negative experience with no momentum?
  9. What is the history behind this effort? How has that history shaped current perceptions? Is this viewed as an “about time” project, or a “why the hell?” project? Have other teams failed? Why? If building on top of an old feature, why was the feature left in the current state? How will it impact the bottom line? Where is the product in the product lifecycle?
  10. Who are the major stakeholders? How do the stakeholders view the problem? Have they already become emotionally attached to potential solutions? Am I already biased? What is the general consensus on the risks involved? Are there any agendas at play? If so, what is our plan to navigate individual agendas?

### Goal And Vision

What is the big picture? Where are we going?

  1. Are the business goals clear and actionable? Are goals framed as target outcomes?
  2. How is our work tied to the goals of the business, and how will we measure our impact?
  3. How is our work tied to the goals of our users/customers, and how will we measure that impact?
  4. Have we communicated those goals with a compelling vision? Does the vision inspire and focus our work? Can it be explained in a tweet? What is our “true north” ? Is the team engaged?
  5. As we discover new information, have we refined the goal appropriately?

### Problem

What problem are we trying to solve?

  1. Does the team have a shared understanding of the problem we are solving? Are we speaking the same language? Does the team have a shared understanding of the problem’s root cause?
  2. Do we understand who we are solving the problem for? What are their needs? In their words, how do they describe those needs? Have we sufficiently researched our customer goals and pain points, including speaking directly with a minimum of ten customers (ideally with the team)?
  3. How are customers solving the problem right now, keeping in mind that our biggest competition is often the status quo?
  4. How much time and resources do we have to solve the problem? Are we running out of either? Do we share a similar sense of urgency? Do we share a high level idea of what we’ll be doing in the next week, weeks, month, and beyond?
  5. How will we rightsize our solution to the problem at hand? At what point will the investment of more time and energy have a limited return?
  6. If we are releasing a feature for an existing product, have we identified the feature as a basic must-have “table stakes” feature, a performance feature, or a differentiator? Have we validated this understanding, or are we operating with limited information?
  7. Who are the team’s go-to subject matter experts (SMEs)? Are they available?
  8. Have we injected the necessary awareness of the market, competition, market, and legal issues into our understanding of the problem? If not, what is the next step to gather that data?
  9. Was the team involved in defining the problem? Do they feel vested and engaged? How can we help them become more vested and engaged?
  10. Would some reframing of our goals and/or KPIs allow us to more effectively understand the problem from the perspective of the business? If this is impossible, is the team OK with the ambiguity? Is this a leap of faith, or a hesitant nosedive?
  11. What would happen if we simply did nothing? Is that an option? Is there a possibility that the problem will solve itself, or the metrics will move without our intervention?
  12. Have we framed the problem in terms of desired outcomes as opposed to possible solutions/features?
  13. Have we leveraged all of our available sources of data to understand the problem, current workarounds, customer behavior, and competitive options?

### Assumptions and Hypotheses

What are our knowns and unknowns?

  1. What are our operating assumptions? Have we validated these assumptions? Does the team understand and share these assumptions? How will we test our untested assumptions?
  2. How do these assumptions stack up in terms of risk? Who bears the possible burden of that risk? Which assumptions must we accept as givens, and which assumptions are open to testing and validation?
  3. What are the constraints to our solution? For example, do we need to use an existing technology framework? Do we have to complete the feature in time for an annual convention?
  4. What parts of the solution are negotiable? For example, could we reduce the breadth of features to release more quickly?
  5. Have we discussed our individual biases? How do these biases impact our view of the problem, and our attachment to our proposed solution?
  6. What is the current, single greatest threat to the project’s success? How will we defend against that threat?
  7. Assuming that “not delivering the intended value to the customer” is our worst case scenario, what steps can we take to make sure that does not happen?
  8. What is our biggest gap in knowledge at the moment? What do we need to learn now? What can we learn later? How can we learn quickly and cheaply? Can we restate these gaps as a series of well-articulated questions?
  9. What piece of information/data impacting our work would we gladly buy if it was immediately available? Is it available? If not, how might we “purchase” that information by committing our resources?
  10. What is the current working hypothesis in terms of a solution? Is there consensus among team members regarding our working hypothesis?
  11. Was the team involved in generating the list of key assumptions, questions, and solution hypotheses? Do they feel vested and engaged? Did the whole team have an opportunity to state key assumptions impacting their area of expertise?
  12. Could some of our questions be resolved by simply having clearer goals?
  13. We likely will need to function amidst some level of ambiguity. Are we potentially overreacting to, or under-reacting to the perceived level of ambiguity?
  14. Have we agreed on a process to track and iterate on our assumptions, risks, and questions?

### Prioritization, Sequence, Delivery

How do we do the most important thing next?

  1. Does the team have a shared understanding of our current priorities, and our near-term prioritization and sequencing of work? Are we in agreement that this is the best plan of action?
  2. Is the sequence of how we intend to release our solution optimized for information gathering? Will it be possible to gather meaningful data given the scope of the incremental releases?
  3. Have we effectively mitigated the risk of confirmation bias / tunnel vision for our solution?
  4. What key decisions will we need to make soon? How will we make these decisions? Are we about to make any irreversible decisions, and if so, do we agree on the potential risks involved?
  5. Is there consensus around which decisions can be deferred?
  6. How will we decide which features are truly essential?
  7. Is the team comfortable with the rough sizing (estimation) of prioritized items?
  8. How will we decide that we’re done? If that seems a long ways off, what are some short term definitions of done? Are these goals specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, and time constrained?
  9. Are we currently on a good trajectory to deliver the best solution possible given our current constraints?
  10. Have we collectively agreed on when we’ll reconvene to reassess our progress?
  11. To what extent are edge cases and newfound dependencies influencing prioritization? Is there a way to decouple our solution from these issues?
  12. Have we acknowledged any technical debt we might introduce into the system? What is our plan for working down any debt caused by our solution?
  13. Do we have a shared understanding of the target fidelity for the next iteration?
  14. How large is our current inventory of untested and unimplemented ideas? How much rework would be required if all of our current inventory was found to be off-target?
  15. How might potential disruption to customers guide our prioritization? Will the feature require training and “unlearning” old habits? Must we validate how we intend to launch the feature?
  16. Was the team involved in prioritizing work and developing the guidelines around how work was sequenced? If their involvement was minimal, are they ok with that?
  17. Does the sequence of work and current prioritization scheme pass rational muster with the team? Could the team repeat the prioritization and sequencing exercise and arrive at the same results? Is it a system that could be used in the future?

### Users/Customers

How do we keep the solution relevant to customers?

  1. Does the team have a working user/customer persona hypothesis? Is the persona visible?
  2. What is the current customer attitude towards the problem? Is this something that users have been expecting for years? Or will the solution come as a welcome surprise?
  3. How are we engaging our customers as we formulate and build a solution? How are we building empathy for their situation and goals? When and how, exactly, will we next share some aspect of our solution with customers?
  4. When was the last time the team interacted with a “real live” customer? What did we learn? How can we learn more when this opportunity next presents itself?
  5. Are we investing our time such that we are maximizing value to our customers? How would an average customer respond if they were to participate in our last meeting or last discussion? Would they call our work valuable? Is our work being described and framed in terms of its utility and value to customers?
  6. At what point will we expose our solution to customers using their data, in their context, and with their day-to-day organic workflows?
  7. Once released to users, how will we gather feedback such that it is actionable and timely? Do we intend to act on this feedback? Will our customers expect us to act on their feedback immediately?
  8. Are our usability testing methods matched with the phase of the solution? Are they generating statistically significant data appropriate for the phase goal? Are we using a good mix of qualitative and quantitative methods?
  9. How will we measure what our customers do in addition to what they say?
  10. What challenges might we face when gathering customer feedback? How can we address these challenges?
  11. Are we leveraging all available channels to gather customer feedback?
  12. How will we make customers aware of this feature? Is this a feature with limited appeal to our customer base? How will we measure adoption as distinct from usability or feature/need fit? Is driving adoption of the feature in scope, and if so, what is the plan to drive adoption?

### Dependencies

How do we manage dependencies?

  1. Will our solution disrupt our customers in the short term? How will this be managed, and what data will we need to feel confident in our management strategy?
  2. Are we communicating effectively to stakeholders outside of our team (sales, support, other teams, users, etc.)?
  3. Are there legal /privacy implications?
  4. Will our solution touch other parts of the product? Are we at risk of negatively impacting the user experience elsewhere?
  5. How and when are we playing “three dimensional chess” as we seek to resolve dependencies? Are we discounting the simplest path forward?

### How We Work

How does the team stay efficient and healthy?

  1. Do we have clear agendas for the next week’s worth of meetings? Do any meetings need to be repurposed to meet current challenges? Can any meetings be canceled?
  2. Are meetings managed for maximum utility? Who documents the decisions and action items resulting from meetings? Are they conducted in conducive settings, with the right tools and participants?
  3. Is the product owner available at all times?
  4. Do we have a clear idea of individual responsibilities? When there are overlaps, have we discussed potential conflicts?
  5. Does our team have the requisite information to make most decisions regarding the solution autonomously? Or, are we losing cycles due to ambiguous goals?
  6. Are we limiting the amount of extraneous and “noisy” data? Does the team feel protected from any competing agendas and politics?
  7. Are we calling things by the same name? Have we developed a common vocabulary to discuss our solution, the problem, and our assumptions?
  8. Do we have momentum? Is that sense of momentum and progress shared by all members of the team? Can the team focus on doing instead of strategizing? Is everyone inspired? Is anyone unclear about what their week looks like? Is momentum building or waning? How can we recover from a recent drop in momentum?
  9. Is anyone on the team blocked? What can be done to remove those blockers? Is our process suffering from any bottlenecks? What can be done to remove those bottlenecks?
  10. Is the team suitably buffered from distractions and disruption?
  11. Does the team feel focused and productive? Are we having fun?
  12. Is the work suitably decomposed so as to limit work in progress? Does the team share a solid definition of done?
  13. Has the team formalized its hand-offs, stages, and agreed upon process?
  14. Have factions formed within the team and, if so, are these factions healthy? Do different points of view drive value to the customer, or should we work to reduce personal bias? Can we harness these differences for good? Can any back-channels be made public?
  15. Is the team collaborating and communicating in an effective manner? Are tools being used consistently?
  16. Can I provide adequate information to other stakeholders regarding the status and focus of the effort? If a rough schedule is required, is that available? Are we maintaining a burndown chart? How does my work fit into the overall roadmap?
  17. Are all sources of information — including ticketing tools, wikis, documents — up to date? Do stakeholders have necessary access? Can extraneous information be removed for clarity?
  18. Are our emails clear, actionable, and scannable?

### Off The Rails?

What happens when things go off the rails?

  1. What does my gut say?
  2. Am I the blocker? If so, how can I change that?
  3. Is there animosity on the team? How can we dispel that immediately?
  4. Am I doing my absolute best to build a shared understanding for all aspects of the project? Am I doing so without dragging the team “through the mud” ?
  5. Beyond presenting data and sound reasoning, am I providing inspiration?
  6. Are we actually shipping?
  7. Can I see the forest through the trees? Can the team?
  8. Are my actions creating an environment of trust and ownership? If I am second guessing the team, can I find a productive way to express my concerns?
  9. What does the team need right now? Did the team crack at least one joke today? Lighten up! Time for beers.
  10. Am I taking care of myself? Eating well? Sleeping well. It all counts?

# Good Process, Bad Process

To most people the word “process” might as well be a four-letter word.

### Good Process, Bad Process

To most people the word “process” might as well be a four-letter word.

At some point in our career, most of us have encountered a misguided attempt
at “big bang” [business process re-
engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_reengineering). Or
a mind-numbing, soul-sapping[TPS-style approval
process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy3rjQGc6lA) (approved in
triplicate!) Or the introduction of the latest hot development approach.

But I see process in a different light. When I think about process I think
about things like the creative process, the learning process, transparent and
collaborative problem solving, information processing, and evolution and
mutation. My thoughts drift to [design
thinking](http://designthinking.ideo.com/), [surfboard
shapers,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wKfwcqD3Og) and [bespoke
tailors](http://www.anderson-sheppard.co.uk/). I just don’t share the visceral
reaction.

In this post I would like to address two common assumptions:

  1. That process is by definition rigid and inflexible
  2. That process is by definition “top down” and overly dogmatic

I’ll start by giving a couple examples of process at work.

Checklists sound awfully controlling. But, by using a checklist surgical teams
can [”significantly lower the number of deaths and
complications”](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/health/20surgery.html?_r=2&ref=health)
regardless of the type of surgery.

> But even a small change, like having surgical team members take a moment to
say who they are and what they do before scalpel touches skin, can have
important consequences later on should one of them develop a concern during
the operation. Earlier studies have shown that communication problems are
fairly common in operating rooms, with junior members of the team sometimes
hesitant to speak up.

While a staff psychologist with the Israeli military, [Daniel Kahneman (Think,
Fast and Slow)](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-
Kahneman/dp/0374533555) describes how his team disrupted the common practice
of assessing new recruits. Instead of relying on intuition and a comprehensive
assessment,[Kahneman introduced a new process consisting of a simple 5 point
quantitative survey](http://www.businessinsider.com/daniel-kahneman-on-hiring-
decisions-2013-1#ixzz3l6otUHal).

> What he came up with was so controversial it almost caused a mutiny.
Kahneman asked interviewers to put aside personal judgments and limit
interviews to a series of factual questions meant to generate a score on six
separate personality traits. A few months later, it became clear that
Kahneman’s systematic approach was a vast improvement over gut decisions. It
was so effective that the army would use his exact method for decades to come.

At Henry Poole [“each new client is a fresh and unique canvas to
us”.](https://henrypoole.com/history-of-henry-poole-tailor-of-savile-row/the-
story/) Their “cutters” use a time honored bespoke process to craft custom
tailored suits.

> With each piece of clothing being made personally by our tailors on the
premises on Savile Row, London, the theme remains consistent: individuality
expressed through craftsmanship and style.

Improv groups use a basic process [to guide the scene while keeping things
“unusual” and interesting](http://www.pantheater.com/articles-rules-of-improv-
part-i-improv-comedy.html).

> Characters need to go on journeys, be altered by revelations, experience the
ramifications of their choices and be moved by emotional moments. We go to the
theater to see the unusual days characters have, not the everyday moments of
stasis and stagnation.

The scientific method (as described by [this
teacher](http://teacher.nsrl.rochester.edu/phy_labs/appendixe/appendixe.html))
“is the process by which scientists, collectively and over time, endeavor to
construct an accurate (that is, reliable, consistent and non-arbitrary)
representation of the world”.

Alistair Cockburn describes the “heart of agile” in four simple words:
collaborate, deliver, reflect, and improve. Which is remarkably similar to the
[learning process](https://teaching.unsw.edu.au/understanding-learning-
processes), and the [Deming Circle
(PDCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*IU7FzFvFIufSAPPL.png)

Four processes form the [“basic
mechanisms”](http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_16) of
evolutionary change: mutation, migration, genetic drift, and natural
selection.

The creative process invites experimentation, and iteration. In describing the
making of Bitches Brew (Miles Davis), [Author Paul Tingen quotes drummer Jack
DeJohnette](http://jazztimes.com/articles/20243-miles-davis-and-the-making-of-
bitches-brew-sorcerer-s-brew):

> This was the beautiful thing about it. He’d do a take, and stop, and then
get an idea from what had just gone before, and elaborate on it, or say to the
keyboards ‘play this sound.’ One thing fed the other. It was a process, a kind
of spiral, a circular situation. The recording of Bitches Brew was a stream of
creative musical energy. One thing was flowing into the next, and we were
stopping and starting all the time, maybe to write a sketch out, and then go
back to recording. The creative process was being documented on tape, with
Miles directing the ensemble like a conductor an orchestra.

The point I’m making with these examples is that process itself is not the
problem. Trying to demonize the concept of a series of steps towards an
outcome is like calling breathing an anti-pattern. Calling it by some other
name: craft, practice, “way of working”, method, and ritual is more palatable
for the process phobe, but we often are discussing the exact same concept.

Thinking on the examples above, a good process …

  1. Represents the current tactic with full knowledge that the tactic may change
  2. Attempts to eliminate individual biases and groupthink
  3. Allows us to reflect on what is and isn’t working using both qualitative and quantitative data
  4. Allows for iteration
  5. Is explicit and transparent … everyone knows what we’re trying to accomplish, minimize, and maximize
  6. Encourages variability and conformance when it is most valuable
  7. Engages the participants and players in an inclusive fashion by harnessing them as sensors and actors
  8. Is repeatable relative to the diversity of inputs and desired outputs
  9. Does not usurp and try to control the collective intelligence of your team

I’d like to end by discussing discipline and process. [Alistair Cockburn has a
great YouTube video on disciplined
Agile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4QEASusC-c) which inspired this line
of thinking.

We often equate discipline and process with rigidity. It just sounds
inflexible. Cockburn claims that “lazy Agile” is surprisingly effective, but
that we can do better by exploring different methods, and processes. Yes this
discipline has more “process” (a couple more box and arrow diagrams), but it
is no less (and perhaps even more) “Agile”.

A disciplined approach can be extremely flexible (you don’t see MMA fighters
throwing up their hands due to the variability of their opponents). And the
disciplined team — just like the disciplined improv group — knows when to
break the rules and explore a new process.

The truly agile organization resists the temptation to oversimplify. Like
surgeons with their checklist it evolves processes to de-bias decisions and
applies discipline (the good kind) and process where it will have the most
leverage. This approach empowers all layers of the organization to experiment
with and evolve the current tactic while making the tactic transparent and
explicit. When modifying open source code we check out the “code” (the
process), iterate, and check back in improvements for testing. It is
egalitarian but disciplined.

In closing, I’d encourage readers to define and practice process (under the
guise of any word, really) in a way that generates results and introspection
for your team and organization.

### Product Ownership: 10 Core Principles

When you boil it down, what does it take to be a great product owner? It’s
easy (and tempting) to overcomplicate things. Often we focus on the “higher
level” aspects and theory of the function, and forget the basics. In my mind,
it all centers around your relationship with your team.

**10 Core Product Ownership Principles**

  1. **Build trust.** Without the trust of your team you have nothing.
  2. **Respect** your team, your customers, and your partners
  3. **Prove your worth**. You aren’t a status-checker along for the ride. You have a function (multiple functions actually). Do the work to build trust, build respect, and empower the team.
  4. **Outcomes over features. **Focus on delivering great outcomes to your customers. Nothing is more discouraging for a team than delivering great software that no one needs, or not knowing whether your work had impact.
  5. **Communicate efficiently**. Boil everything down to an actionable message. You are the noise and distraction filter. Synthesize ruthlessly so others don’t have to.
  6. **Build an action framework**. Provide the data, direction, and exposure necessary for autonomous decision making. Let the team take credit for their solution.
  7. **Decide and facilitate appropriately. **Sometimes the team needs a decider. Sometimes the team needs help making a decision. And sometimes you need to just get out of the way. Act accordingly.
  8. **Run great meetings.**
  9. **Focus on team needs**. How can you help your team today? What do they actually need? Focus there.
  10. **Have fun. **If you view product ownership as a battle between you and the team, then no one will have fun. Keep it light and positive.

That’s it. Not too complicated. But no one said it would be easy!

### Juggling Growth and Usability: A UX Debt Primer

The concept of technical debt is generally understood. But what happens when
we extend the concept to product design and user experience? Can an interface
accumulate debt? And what can we do about it?

### Technical Debt Primer

The now well known metaphor technical debt was coined by [Ward
Cunningham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham)to describe both the
intentional and unintentional accumulation of loose ends in software design.
Taking the metaphor too literally gets you in trouble (and can derail any
meeting, especially with engineers), but the general idea is that at some
point all organizations have to “pay off” the debt through a deliberate
allocation of resources, “write off” the debt by starting over, and/or suffer
the consequences.

Lucky companies play the balancing act to perfection, foregoing key decisions
until the last possible moment, while benefitting from current knowledge and
data. Unlucky companies eventually take a big hit, falling behind competitors
as they struggle to dig out. And negligent organizations inject debt
haphazardly, without any quantitative sense of the debt being accumulated or
the interest rate.

### Agile, XP, and Technical Debt

One thing that agile does very well is to iteratively address customer-focused
features. When paired with [extreme programming (XP)
practices](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html), such as test-driven
development and pair programming, agile does a decent job of hedging against
certain forms of technical debt, and striking that fine balance between speed,
quality, and cost. Evolved teams dedicate some percentage of resources to the
[gradual reduction of debt,](http://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2014/03/04/reversing-
your-organizations-technical-debt/?mod=wsjcio_hp_deloitte) and use sound
design principles (e.g. system decoupling, design patterns, etc.) to ease the
pain. So for technical debt, we have some models for success, albeit with a
lot of debate in the engineering community.

### UX Debt

The discussion becomes a bit more complicated when we discuss the concept of
UX debt. What happens when we accumulate baggage in our product design and
interface?

[Lean UX](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/07/lean-ux-getting-out-of-
the-deliverables-business/) practices have done a great deal towards
integrating design into the agile process, with a strong focus on cross-team
facilitation, less up-front design, and tighter collaboration between
engineers, designers, and other usability/design oriented disciplines (like
researchers, information architects, etc.)

But many designers will admit to a nagging worry. The thought that keeps them
up at night is whether the whole product experience is the best it can be, and
when will they need to pay off the debt incurred during rapid, feature-focused
design. If big upfront design is dead, then how do we create cohesive user
experiences in a flurry of discrete features?

### The Symptoms

UX debt can be recognized by some of the following symptoms:

  * The interface fails to gracefully absorb new features (tab overload, action overload). Remember Amazon prior to the [2011 redesign](http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/02/amazon-coms-big-redesign-is-arriving-soon/)?
  * Design patterns are highly specialized, linear, and task based (which isn’t surprising given the features were built based on user stories)
  * Customer blindness to new features. Interface does not encourage natural exploration of new features
  * Inconsistency with regards to interaction patterns, information architecture, and UI components. For new users [this causes significant cognitive load](http://www.clemson.edu/catlab/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/mendel-pak-2009.pdf)
  * Difficulty adapting interface for new screens, new applications, new integrations
  * Heavy coupling between the presentation layer and backend. “Re-skinning” the whole product, or similar components across product, is difficult or impossible
  * Addressing usability issues in “green field” type projects, while ignoring UX issues in core flows in the product. This typically suggests some technical limiters / blockers when it comes to refactoring the UX.

A key takeaway here is that accumulating design debt is not inherently bad.
There might be perfectly good reasons why your company exhibits these
symptoms, and chooses to focus elsewhere. Design is certainly not the only
discipline to be sacrificed in the quest for speed to market and growth (think
gathering data, tools to speed customer service, etc.). The trouble is that UX
debt is often poorly understood and misvalued. It just starts to “feel” wrong,
without any quantitative metrics to prove otherwise.

### Lack of Forcing Function

As with technical debt, the difficulty here is that there is rarely some “do
or die” moment that acts as a forcing function. Big tidal shifts like the rise
of mobile, or a violent loss of market share do happen, but most of the time
things don’t move that fast.

Like a sailboat picking up barnacles and kelp, the slowdown can be barely
perceptible, until impacts start to accrue exponentially (as is common with
highly dynamic systems like interfaces). Going from 8 mph to 7 mph takes a
while, but suddenly you’ve dropped from 7 mph to 4 mph, and you need to turn
into the wind, pull down the sails, and send someone overboard to address the
issue. And it is never easy: existing customers seldom welcome redesigns with
open arms, even if you are making the product more generally usable.

### Invisible

Another problem is that UX debt is often invisible (which is rather
counterintuitive considering it is the central touchpoint for the customer).
Engineers seldom use all the product features on a regular basis. And UX debt
just doesn’t hit home like failing systems and code modules. Customer support
staff, while often being expert users, adopt workarounds. Especially in B2B
products, there exists a general sense that users can be “trained” to adopt
suboptimal flows. And finally, and probably most importantly, humans have
trouble noticing slight changes. The product design literally changes under
our noses, until something big and serious happens. This often comes in the
form of a competitor who offers superior design and ease of use, while we’re
left struggling to keep up.

### Usability Testing

Usability testing in the context of agile development often focuses solely on
the feature in question. Tasks are developed, and the participant is asked to
proceed through a task while talking out loud. Like an architect building
extremely comfortable rooms with awkwardly placed doors and lights, it is
possible for flows to test well while remaining unusable and inconsistent
within the context of the whole product. The agile focus on tested usable
features delivered quickly is immensely valuable, but doesn’t inherently
address consistency and general usability.

### A Continuous Juggling Act (And Some Tips)

The juggling act never ends. The best strategy is one of quantification,
informed risk mitigation, and building awareness of the issue. The integration
of UX on agile teams is relatively new, and there simply might not be a full
appreciation for the risks involved. Cataloging missing features is old hat,
but understanding why the holistic design strategy matters is a relatively new
challenge. To get the discussion going, I’d like to present a few possible
strategies to make UX debt real, address it early, and build awareness across
the team:

  1. **Always test your product with people who fit your customer profile**, but who are not current customers. Do your best to avoid the[anchoring bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring) whereby the standard for excellence is the current product. Think of this as TDD (test driven development) for product design. Ask yourself how you can develop a repeatable process to assess whole-product usability by user role.
  2. **Establish usability benchmarks against commonly used products both in your domain and outside your domain**. And test your product against those benchmarks. Time to completion for tasks is informative only when relative to the time it would take the same user to complete a familiar task. In many domains with late adopters, it can be easy to trounce the competition from a usability perspective. But remember that your customers will evolve and establish new benchmarks. Mobile is a major catalyst in terms of turning late adopters into power users with high UX expectations.
  3. **Catalog components** in your software and categorize by pattern, application, visitor traffic, and whether they are on the critical path to key conversions. Many teams are unaware of just how many variations they have developed
  4. **Find a way to quantify your UX debt**. Options could include combining the results of benchmark tests (both customers and non-customers), customer feedback, and inline surveys. The emphasis here is getting buy in for your methodologies across the team, and making the accumulation (and pay off) of debt visible
  5. **Leverage pattern libraries and frameworks** for DRY UI development.
  6. **Assume that the interface will change**. Trends will develop. Technologies will develop. So how will you consistently offer the best user experience possible? Approach this challenge in partnership with your engineers, and adopt practices in systems design that will allow an [architecture to emerge](http://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2013/august/agile-architecture-emerges-or-does-it)
  7. **Discuss the risk with your team.** UX is a new addition to agile teams, and ways of working are still be ironed out. An exercise might involve a pre-mortem, whereby team members discuss how ignoring UX debt might derail the team at some future point.
  8. **Establish checkpoints and regular design reviews** to recognize when redesign or refactoring of the interface is required. Involve the whole team
  9. Dedicate some part of every sprint to working down UX related debt

# User Stories and Data

I frequently hear questions like …

* * *

### User Stories and Data

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YI6YoTq9GexVQpoNxav-dA.png)

I frequently hear questions like …

**_“How do you know what to measure?”_**  
**_“How do you write data stories?”_**  
**_“Where do we even start?”_**

One approach is to write data-specific user stories. These stories often look
something like this:

**_Data stuff. See John_**

That’s not great. Though it is a placeholder for a conversation which is a
good user story pattern. I’ll give it that. One step up is to try something
like this:

**_As a product development team, we can measure the rate of successful adoption for the new widget maker so that we can optimize the experience for customers_**

This is decent. But something is missing. Where is the direct value to the
customer? And if you’re like most teams this type of story will be an
afterthought. Which makes perfect sense. User value ([and user
personas](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/personas-epics-user-stories/))
comes first.

I prefer to take another approach. Incorporate data into each and every story.

Think for a moment about the “T” in the [popular INVEST
acronym](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/invest.html) (a way to remember
and assess what makes a good User Story). User stories are supposed to be
Testable. We go to great ends to write unit, functional, and integration
tests. But how about testing our basic hypotheses? Or that the story is
meeting user expectations and driving the expected value?

User acceptance testing to the rescue! Well, sort of. Wouldn’t it be great if
everything worked as smoothly as this
[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4904096/whats-the-
difference-between-unit-functional-acceptance-and-integration-test) snippet:

> If the tests pass, it means the software should meet the customer’s
requirements and the stories can be considered complete. An acceptance test
suite is basically an executable specification written in a domain specific
language that describes the tests in the language used by the users of the
system.

Great. Fire up that domain specific language. When your executable
specification passes you’ve got a winning feature! Mark it complete! And keep
that velocity rolling. Cue my favorite user story from real 1st hand
experience:

**_As a product manager, I can see the [Feature Name] feature finished in two weeks, so that I can approve it_**

Joke? Almost. Keep in mind that the Scrum basically relies on a customer, or
customer proxy, to sit there and “approve” the feature. You’re done at the end
of the sprint when someone nods and says “yes”. And then the feature
disappears off into the ether. **Out of Sprint, out of mind! **Or at least
into the hands of business analysts.

But acceptance tests give a valuable hint. Let’s take a look at a [popular
acceptance test format](http://codesqueeze.com/the-easy-way-to-writing-good-
user-stories/):

> Given [context] And [some more context]… When [event] Then [outcome] And
[another outcome]…

Sure this format can be used for the low level aspects of a story. But take a
broader view. We’re making assumptions about:

  * **Context:** The problem context or situation
  * **Events:** Events taken to rectify the problem
  * **Outcomes: **What outcomes result from attempts to solve the problem

Consider this example from a great, new, product idea I just had:

> Example: **GIVEN** that people are perpetually in need of social
gratification,**AND THAT** they enjoy seeing news from their friends, **WHEN**
they encounter a “feed” of friend related news-snippets, **THEN** they will
spend hours online, and may even click on ads.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*t8aZUJuE-oRCvArH.gif)

Bingo! You have some clues for what to measure. You have context, events, and
outcomes. Now validate!

[Alexander Cowan puts it bes](http://www.alexandercowan.com/best-agile-user-
story/)t:

> It’s silly to hold your nose, take the plunge and hope you’re right. It’s
practical and effective to max out what you can know without spending a lot of
time and money, start with the simplest possible implementation of a new
feature, and then have an explicit plan to get a definitive result about its
relevance. This is how a lot of actual innovation happens- effective
experimentation (aka effective trial and error).

When I suggest this approach, the first question I typically hear is something
like:

> This is all good in theory, but Scrum says I need to mark the job complete
at the end of two weeks. And that we’ll ship it. There is no place for this
experiment! And we’ll never finish those stories if we actually add the
tracking.

To that I would ask whether it is better to do the 20% that matters, or the
80% that doesn’t. Which brings up my final point. Taking a more data-centric
approach is actually not about the tools, or even how you write stories. It is
about something more fundamental.

Do you have dedicated, cross-functional, problem focused, and outcome driven
teams? And do they actually control the destiny and shape of their work? Are
they allowed to fail sometimes? And are they incentivized for output and
utilization (being busy) or generating results?

Answer those questions and address any issues there (easier said than done),
and then find a way to work in the data stories. My preference is to place
them immediately in the user-centric stories or epics. Keep it lightweight,
and similar to acceptance tests. Add some baselines and targets. And then use
Kanban or another tool to pass the stories out from the sprint, and into a
measure/learn flow. You may be “done”, but the story isn’t “Done” until it has
achieved the desired intent.


# 10 Questions For Your (Product Role) Interviewer

### 10 Questions For Your (Product Role) Interviewer

It’s that nervous time of the product manager interview. You’re tired, need to
re-caffeinate, are worried you don’t have enough “domain experience”, and have
just had to calculate the number of[ airplane passengers currently airborne in
the United States](https://www.quora.com/How-many-people-are-in-the-air-
flying-at-any-given-time).

The dreaded question is coming … “do you have any questions for me?” Oh crap!

Let me try to flip the script for you. You are interviewing this company for
the opportunity to have you work there, and not the other way around. Product
Management is extremely org-specific. It’s the perfect example of
product/market fit (with you being the product). What works in one company
will leave you burnt out, ineffective, and maligned in the next. It is vital
that you find a place where you can thrive. So use this opportunity wisely.

During the hiring process there may be a lot of talk about empowerment,
ownership, and customer-centric thinking (sidenote, if you hear the one about
the mini-CEO just leave immediately). Are they putting lipstick on a pig and
rolling out a gravity challenged magic carpet? Or describing your next dream
job? Below I’ve listed 10 questions to ask when the interview tables are
turned. Be curious and respectful, and let’em rip.

  1. Knowing what you know at the moment, what weakness might I need to work on if I were to get this job? How would we go about structuring opportunities to improve on that weakness?
  2. If you were to hire a product manager internally from another department/group, what is your best bet at the department they would currently work for? Why?
  3. How would you rank the following in terms of your overall priorities: speed, rigor, quality, harmony, outcomes, and empathy ?
  4. Are there recurring sources of tension between functional groups in the organization? Are they healthy? If so, how do you make sure they stay healthy?
  5. How does your approach to product differ from that of your competitors? Who do you admire in your space (or another domain)? How are you differentiated?
  6. Has the product team established any core values? What are they? Could you tell me a story or two that would help me understand those values? How has the role of product management evolved here over the years?
  7. Let’s say I was to go out and ask one of your engineers about their relationship with the product team … what would they say? What would be their foremost gripe? How would they describe the value you deliver to them personally?
  8. If the 80/20 rule holds true (and it tends to), what is the 20% of my work that will generate 80% of the value? Where will I have the most leverage in my day-to-day work? How do you help the team focus on this area?
  9. In Geoffrey A. Moore’s [Crossing The Chasm](http://readwrite.com/2007/08/06/rethinking_crossing_the_chasm) he mentions a Technology Adoption Lifecycle comprised of three primary markets: **Early** (Innovators and Early Adoptions), **Mainstream** (Early Majority and Late Majority), and **Late** (Laggards). Where is the product and market currently? Where will we be in a year? How will the team and dynamics change as we make this transition?
  10. What is the most frequently misunderstood aspect of the product role internally? And how do you work to bridge that misunderstanding?

Choose wisely, or better yet just let the freak flag fly. There is no hiding
in product management. If you are passionate about what you do then don’t plan
on just flying below the radar. Don’t plan on things changing (they rarely
do). PMs are always above the radar and exist at the confluence of major
forces and pressures in the organization. So choose wisely!

Go forth and find the right match!

**Shameless Pitch:** When you’re there, consider giving [Pendo](http://www.pendo.io/) (my employer, and an all around swell place to work) a try to guide the team towards better collaborative decisions and improved user experiences. We’d get to work together and you could give blistering and honest feedback to make our product great.


# Hidden Costs of the Sales-Driven Roadmap

Exploring the cost side of the Sales Driven Roadmap

* * *

### Hidden Costs of the Sales-Driven Roadmap

_Exploring the cost side of the Sales Driven Roadmap_

> This deal is at risk until we can ____________

> Are you ranking these requests by the revenue opportunity?

> They won’t renew unless we _________

> Can we schedule a meeting to review the following RFP points?

As a product manager in the B2B space you’ll inevitably run into a situation
where sales is pressuring you to prioritize work to close a deal or retain a
customer. It’s a dance Sales, Product, and Customer Success repeats over and
over (picture a clumsy threeway waltz or polka). Cue the conference call
feedback, twenty page RFPs, and rushed impromptu cross-team standups.

It’s a challenge. You are customer focused. You have empathy. But somehow the
cost vs. reward feels off and you can’t prove it. Don’t give up so soon.
Consider the following …

#### Growth Driver

Before jumping into thinking about costs let’s get one thing out of the way.
At the end of the day you might not be too concerned about costs simply
because controlling costs isn’t the focus. The underlying assumption for most
growing businesses is that costs can eventually be controlled. Revenue and
growth is king (see [The Single Biggest Determinant Of Startup Valuations At
IPO](http://tomtunguz.com/2013-ipo-characteristics/)). You’ll read the impacts
below and say “that’s all good, but we need to hit a growth goal”. I respect
that. But I’d challenge you to consider instead the potential drags on
innovation and agility. These are blockers to growth and should be considered.
Keep reading …

#### Bias Petri Dish

It’s easy to rationalize the broad appeal of a feature request. We’d need to
do this eventually, right? Other customers and prospects will need this if
Acme needs this, right? There are a bunch of cognitive biases at play here
including the [availability
heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic), [base rate
fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy), [clustering
illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_illusion), [sunk cost
bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs), [confirmation
bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias), and [conjunction
fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy). These manifest as
follows:

  * _The prospect is representative of other prospects and customers_
  * _The prospect’s needs are not specif. They are general_
  * _The prospect request is equally valued by other customers and prospects_
  * _Meeting the prospect request will actually result in a satisfied customer_
  * _We’ve invested a lot of time and money in cultivating this prospect so …_
  * _This run of requests represents a trend_

We’ve all been victims to these biases in our personal and work lives. You
can’t escape. As a species these instincts have served us well for the most
part. However, the prospect request is straight out of an MIT behavioral
economics study. It hits so many pressure points that most of us are basically
screwed. It’s as if you combined the lottery, your love life, and probability
in a petri dish. What’s the point here? You’re not seeing things clearly and
your intuition is suspect.

#### Net Loss

Off the bat you’re at a net-loss if you invest $50,000 in engineering and
product resources to deliver a feature which will increase your revenue by
$100,000. Why? Isn’t that a profit? No. Not even close. The code will need to
be maintained and will add to the complexity of the overall codebase hindering
future velocity and innovation. Features need documentation, sales training,
marketing, and support. And we’re not even talking about the other costs
associated with that $100k of revenue (acquisition, on ramping, etc.) No one
“accounts” for these costs. They rarely exist on a balance sheet. But they’re
real and will bite you.

#### User Experience Impact

Imagine an aging hotel. Hallways disappear into nowhere. The light switches
are never in the right place. It takes ten minutes to get to the pool. The
Internet is spotty. Countless new additions create a sprawl that is difficult
to navigate.

Welcome to the world of most enterprise software. You can get by for a while …
heck, the “user” didn’t even cut the check … but you can never truly escape.
This costs is extremely difficult to quantify but we’ve all, at some point,
been on the receiving end of enterprise software that truly sucks usability-
wise. And when a disruptor pops up that shifts the script we’re all the more
willing to embrace the alternative.

#### Customer Need

The prospect has a list of requirements. Lists of requirements feel
comfortable. They’re relatively easy to write — heck, just add a couple points
for good measure. Someone owns this decision and by golly they’re going to own
it. As someone involved in buying tools I can say without doubt that the
requirements process is simply broken. It’s aspirational. Big and heavy RFPs
are a recipe for failed implementations and software detritus. They may close
deals, but they are not a leading indicator of long term adoption. In the heat
of the moment it’s tempting to treat the RFP as gospel and the byproduct of
careful research. It rarely is. The customer may rave about your
responsiveness at first, but they might not be any happier in a year.

From an Agile perspective this is a big “requirements upfront” anti-pattern:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ovSub-mFzsrJzHrZTo7J-A.png)

Looks simple huh? ([Source](http://sunnibrown.com/2009/05/rfp-evaluation-
process-map))

As someone with UX Research experience I can say beyond a doubt that lists of
features rarely address true needs. They jump to the What before the Why.

#### **Value Proposition**

If one feature is the deciding factor between the buy or pass what does that
tell you about your business and product? Consider tools that solve a unique
pain incredibly well. We get frustrated as users. We have to invent
workarounds to make up for missing features. But we use it anyway because it
does something incredibly well. If you’re battling over RFP bullet points
consider the game you want to play. Are you battling over commodity features?

#### Opportunity Costs

This one is simple. By working on one thing you are by definition not working
on something else. What are you sacrificing to attend to the prospect request?
What could you build or explore given those resources? What is the value of
doing this now vs. two months from now?

#### Distractions &amp; Multitasking

External requests typically involve a lot of multitasking. There are endless
cycles back and forth between sales, product management, and engineering. It’s
hard to get the right people on the phone. You’re at the whim of conference
calls. Just when you think you’ve nailed down the request someone else pops up
and peppers your understanding like a gattling gun. Conservatively the team is
at 50% effectiveness and it seeps into their other responsibilities.

Product development teams also feel the pinch. Prospect requests are typically
run in parallel with existing roadmap driven work. It takes 3x the amount of
time to finish two parallel tracks. SImply put, your team runs slower.

#### Conclusion

Hopefully that gives you some food for thought. I currently work for
[Pendo.io](http://www.pendo.io/), an analytics tool with in-app guide and
messaging functionality. One of the unique selling propositions of Pendo is
that we record user activity retroactive to install. In the rush to crank out
customer requests it can be prohibitive to add metrics and measure uptake. Our
customers use this feature to reality check their intuition. Sure, the deal
closed, but did anyone end up using it? Did it impact customer satisfaction
(measurable with our in-app surveys and funnels)? The cost to answer these
questions is low which in turn improves your team’s intuition in the face of
bias. Until the costs are real, the debate will always swing towards Sales and
the immediate prospect request.

Hope this has been helpful. Follow me on Twitter at

going.


# The Way Of The Product Whatchamacallit

Behold the Product Whatchamacallit! The who? Who knows? The Internet sure
doesn’t.

* * *

### The Way Of The Product Whatchamacallit

Behold the **Product Whatchamacallit!** The who? Who knows? The Internet sure
doesn’t.

What does it do? Does it have a tail? Does it [own or
manage](http://blog.aha.io/index.php/the-product-manager-vs-product-owner/)?
Mini-CEO or minion? Who knows!? The Internet sure doesn’t. Maybe this dolphin
does. Nope.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*l7OCGXPxzzJcWXYGJt4aiA.png)

Ever feel like a smart dolphin utterly confused by Product Management?

But I’ll tell you about a recipe. It’s simply, simply simple!

#### **Ingredient #1**

Find a bunch of motivated hackers, builders, crafters,
[makers](http://www.wired.com/2013/04/makermovement/), designers of all
stripes (coders are designers, also), inventors, and visionaries. Trust them,
they’ve got a lot in common. Don’t separate them into departments. Departments
are for Sears and Macy’s.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Cp_BQY4pvuxL87NfT4LbEg.png)

Together We Make Stuff. And Trust The Other People Know Their Shit

#### **Ingredient #2**

Start talking to humans together, observe their problems, and ponder how to
solve those problems. Build a bit. Test your assumptions, tweak, and repeat.
Sell it. And talk to those salesamajigs. They’ve got feelings too.

#### **Mind **Your Business

At this point hopefully you are all still “the business”. The product is
everyone’s business, not some distant group of people who sit in a frosty
windowed conference room dreaming up the work you’ll do for the next year (and
claim you’re still empowered to solve the problem). Fight for this for as long
as humanly possible. Decentralize. Look skeptically across the room when
someone says that you (codeword engineering and UX) just need to “execute on
the roadmap” and then doles out projects.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gJzNUvyYbJdl23kxh5590g.png)

The Sorcerer And The Magic ProjectMap

#### **The Product Whatchamacallit**

So you are still **The Business**. It’s **Your Business To Mind**. Your
[Product To Mind](http://www.mindtheproduct.com/). Phew. Even then, there will
probably be some need for a Product Whatchamacallit, but the role will be much
more helpful and tangible. She’ll be a person the team would hire if they
controlled the budget (not such a crazy idea, actually). Because that person
will DO helpful stuff and earn their keep, not just lubricate the three creaky
gears of your org.

If you happen to be that lucky person -- and trust me this isn’t the standard
“recipe for burnout, can’t wait till I’m in biz dev or strategy” role -- then
read on. Embrace the Whatchamacallit Way.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YdTYpziOt-ne-H28INCZzQ.png)

Maybe? Could it be?

### The **Way Of The Product Whatchamacallit**

  * Show empathy **NOT** indifference
  * Ask why and who **NOT** how and what
  * Serve teams **NOT** agendas
  * Be guided by principles **NOT** plans
  * Be a team-member **NOT** a team-driver
  * Focus on challenges and needs **NOT** titles
  * Treat teammates like creative makers **NOT** resources
  * Provide context and data **NOT** solutions and platitudes
  * Have suggestions and opinions **NOT** demands and fiats
  * Be curious and open **NOT** dismissive and stubborn
  * Harness diversity **NOT** conformity
  * Embrace simplicity **NOT** oversimplification
  * Deliver outcomes and impact **NOT** features and output
  * Build less **NOT** more
  * Be transparent **NOT** opaque or manipulative
  * Be accessible **NOT** elusive or overbearing

Together we deliver valuable outcomes and delight the humans who use and pay
for our product, and the business and team will benefit. We’ll feel good about
our work, and customers will come up to us in airports when we wear our shwag
t-shirts and thank us.

Go forth Whatchamacallit ! They’ll tell you “it’s not that simple”! Ask Why
five times and see where you get …

### This PM Hack Saved Me 1 Hour A Day (and helped me connect with more
customers)

_How I saved an hour every day, stopped wasting my team and customers’ time,
and gathered valuable insights and feedback from our customers._

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*KiQcA8JAMWnAV31b.)

**Image by **[**petradr**](https://unsplash.com/petradr)

As a product manager (with strong UX tendencies) I start to get very anxious
if I’m not talking to customers daily. I don’t discriminate between
qualitative and quantitative data. It’s all valuable. Spend too much time
looking at charts, graphs, and tables, and you’re liable to to lose sight of
the “Why” and the story.

Enter the product manager’s arch nemesis: time management. Scheduling calls is
a hassle for all parties. It’s terrible UX and I hate wasting customer time.
Building a research panel / customer panel with survey data is all well and
good, but it often fails to sift the signal from the noise. You often chat
with customers [who don’t actually use the feature or don’t fit the
profile](http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/07/recruiting-better-
research-participants.php). Or worse yet you just focus on the “vocal
minority” instead of the [silent majority](https://www.box.com/blog/building-
products-vocal-minority-or-silent-majority/).

Enter in-app targeting and online booking tools. At
[Pendo](http://www.pendo.io/) we love to [dog-food our own
product](https://beatrixapp.com/blog/6-months-of-dogfooding-our-
software.html). Our guide targeting functionality allows fine-grained
targeting based on activity, feature usage, and external data (from Salesforce
and other integrations).

Below I’ll walk you through the ingredients for a recent real-world use case.
My goal was to set up meetings with customers to discuss their “[jobs to be
done](https://medium.com/the-job-to-be-done)” for our guides functionality.
What decisions do they make daily? How can we help them do their job more
effectively?

### Ingredient 1#: An In-App Guide

In this example I used the standard Pendo lightbox
[template](https://pendo.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/2245494) with a
simple call to action. Keep the copy light and appreciative. “Schedule It!” is
a good CTA because it conveys the ability to complete the task without human
assistance. I prefer this approach to email because it reaches the customer
in-context when they are more receptive to the guide copy and request for
feedback.

### Ingredient #2: Targeting

I targeted this guide to frequent users of our guide detail page (guide
details page viewed &gt; 5 times). This is case where casting a wide net is
NOT ideal. You want to screen your interviewees, and limit the disruption to
visitors who don’t match your screening criteria.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ac-puspG3KKhjjzj.)

### Ingredient #3:A online booking app.

I suggest [YouCanBookMe](https://youcanbook.me/). Some important features are:
setting a recurring lunch break, specifying work hours, appointment lead time
(min and max), etc. This will make your life easier. The YCBM free version
allows a single booking profile, but still manages to add appointments to my
calendar. From a customer standpoint, the experience is pretty intuitive. They
click on the button in the guide and see this:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*KyEhoG_XcqKl_NZJ.)

### Outcome

Out of 50 of our customers who saw this guide, 10 booked appointments. A 20%
response rate for research requests — qualified real world users, no less — is
pretty awesome. Consider an email campaign with 30% open rates and 30%
response rates and we’re talking a ~2x improvement with no hassle. I didn’t
need to send a survey to a panel. I didn’t litter people’s email inboxes and
play email tag. And this all occurred on the “customer’s terms” and at their
convenience. Our sessions were more productive and focused without the typical
scramble around booking. Best of all, the data was more actionable for the
team.

Give it a try! My philosophy is to talk to customers daily. You need to
reality check your assumptions daily and, to [quote Steve
Blank](http://www.inc.com/steve-blank/key-to-success-getting-out-of-
building.html), “get out of the (virtual) building”. When you cut the
scheduling insanity, this suddenly becomes MUCH easier.


# As Product Managers We’re Asking Ourselves The Wrong Set Of Questions

Stop trying to define product management. It’s a fool’s game.

### As Product Managers We’re Asking Ourselves The Wrong Set Of Questions

_Stop trying to define product management. It’s a fool’s game._

_Stop defining yourself by what you aren’t. What do you care about? How do you
want to work with the people around you?_

When reading articles about product management you frequently encounter words
like “[chameleon](https://blog.intercom.io/the-product-manager-chameleon/)”,
“[whitespace](https://medium.com/@danielfschmidt/a-map-of-white-space-for-
product-managers-17d65c397749)”, and
“[glue](http://onproductmanagement.net/2009/06/22/why-do-we-undermine-
ourselves/)”. “It’s complicated!” Product Management is described by what it
isn’t (e.g. [project management](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-de-haaff
/the-product-manager-vs-pr_b_8040402.html), [scrum
master](http://blog.aha.io/index.php/the-product-manager-vs-the-scrum-
master/)) or by how it is expressed in the context of a domain or methodology
(e.g. in [Agile](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/), in
[B2B](http://www.mindtheproduct.com/2014/06/product-management-b2b/), in
[SaaS](http://pragmaticmarketing.com/resources/saas-product-management), in
Lean Startup).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2ordkKcC7Vqb17nx60_coA.png)

… surfing the Google in search for answers

I’ve been in teams that — after a year — still couldn’t describe the value the
PM/PO brought to the table. The answer was to keep regurgitating the same
posts and books …. as if to say “see, we DO something! I’m valuable because
Intercom or Marty Cagan said so!”

In 2015 I attended three conferences where the best presenter jokes were PM/PO
jokes, and the audience of UXers and Engineers ate it up.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*m9YMgBo9_5syWPhYqgjkyw.png)

In my view we’re asking the wrong question. We’re replacing a tough discussion
of values and principles — as a whole team, not just as product managers —
with discussions about titles, job descriptions, the org chart, and handoffs.
The best perspectives on product development [have nothing to do with defining
and boxing a title](https://medium.com/@stewart/we-dont-sell-saddles-here-
4c59524d650d#.w2rffmxtb). [Stewart Butterfield](https://medium.com/@stewart)
doesn’t mention the word “manager” once but you walk away from reading that
knowing he gives a damn.

It’s gotten to the point that I don’t recommend product management to hungry,
entrepreneurial, and creative young people. I advocate for the various hats
occasionally worn by PMs, but caution against the “title”. **I suggest User
Experience or Engineering. **There’s a community of practice and a less
weighty chip on the shoulder.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WzG_M_41ku68_uSZEPjTLg.png)

Consider what a young associate product manager wrote me the other day:

> My boss is the VP of Product. She has needs and pushes me. Then the team.
wants to do a good job. I feel them. So do I, but I have all this other crap
to consider. I want to be customer-centric but Sales keeps pushing product.
I’m pushing back all day. I deflect shit. The team kinda resents me. They
don’t see 80% of the shit I deal with. It is this juggling act. I am a
juggling act … I don’t even know what “product” means anymore …

That pains me as a lover of building great products. My bet … she’ll leave the
industry in 6 years. Tops.

As Product Managers we insist on describing what we aren’t or what we connect
(how/what) instead of what we value (the “why”). Values are lofty, but we fail
to take a stand.

That extends to how we want to be with our fellow product development
teammates. And with that, I offer my personal values and principles as they
pertain to working with teams. **Your values / principles will vary (**these
appeared first in my post [The Way Of The Product
Whatchamacallit](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/the-way-of-the-product-
whatchamacallit-9929a78d6694#.ln3zzv6sf) )

  * Show empathy **NOT** indifference
  * Ask why and who **NOT** how and what
  * Serve teams **NOT** agendas
  * Be guided by principles **NOT** plans
  * Be a team-member **NOT** a team-driver
  * Focus on challenges and needs **NOT** titles
  * Treat teammates like creative makers **NOT** resources
  * Provide context and data **NOT** solutions and platitudes
  * Have suggestions and opinions **NOT** demands and fiats
  * Be curious and open **NOT** dismissive and stubborn
  * Harness diversity **NOT** conformity
  * Embrace simplicity **NOT** oversimplification
  * Deliver outcomes and impact **NOT** features and output
  * Build less **NOT** more
  * Be transparent **NOT** opaque or manipulative
  * Be accessible **NOT** elusive or overbearing

What are your values as they pertain to collaboration? What do you care about
personally? Beyond what you aren’t … what are you? Start there. And then worry
about the bullets in your job description and the platitudes of “customer
first”, “connective tissue”, and “balancing acts”.

### 50 Interview Questions For B2B SaaS Customer Research

_A no-nonsense list of of questions for B2B SaaS Customer Research_

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*iDQbRKoEiCmtCjRbM93D9A.png)

This is an audio cassette

I’m going to jump straight in …. I’ve got a lot of customer interviews coming
up in the next week ([I blame in-app
scheduling](http://blog.pendo.io/2016/01/22/this-product-manager-hack-saved-
me-one-hour-a-day-and-helped-me-connect-with-more-customers/)) and figured
that it was a good time to put some pen to paper. First some context:

#### **Interview Goals**

  * Know customers and their “[jobs to be done](http://www.christenseninstitute.org/key-concepts/jobs-to-be-done/)”
  * Focus on problems vs. solutions

#### **Remind customers that …**

  * They can’t hurt your feelings
  * Your job isn’t to sell them, market to them, or take their feature requests
  * There are no right, wrong, or stupid answers
  * You’re happy to address support questions after the interview

#### **Interview Tips:**

  * Use words/phrases like “show me”, “tell me that story”, “what’s a real world example of that”, “why”, “who”, “how come”, “tell me more”, “how do you do that right now”, “sketch that” etc.
  * Be comfortable with awkward silences
  * Talk less as a rule. Let the customer do the talking.
  * Be aware of nonverbal cues, and “leading”. Take a deep breath and smile. Repeat words to yourself to stay in the zone like “curious”, “observant”, “patient”, “open”, “non-judgmental”, and “respectful”. Write these down as reminders
  * Use an audio recorder so as not to distract the customer. Or have a notetaker

Notes from a recent meeting …

Commence!

### The Questions

Important: In these questions **Acme** is your product or brand. “You” is the
customer.

  1. If you weren’t working as a/n **[customer title]** what would you be doing?
  2. If you had one work-related superpower what would it be? How would it work? Every superhero has a weakness. What’s your weakness?
  3. If **Acme** was a brand of car, what would it be? Why?
  4. What is the least understood aspect of your job? Why?
  5. What is your unofficial job title?
  6. If you’re comfortable chatting about non-work things … what hats do you wear outside of work?
  7. Draw me the informal, real-world org chart of your department. How are things really connected? How does **it really get done?
  8. Describe your personal aspirations for your career. What are you looking for in terms of career development? What’s the next big hurdle? What strengths will you leverage?
  9. You have a magic ball. Money is no object. You can pick three metrics to put up on big monitors all over your team’s workspace. What are those numbers?
  10. Some things have a tangible value associated with them. Other things are intangible. What is an example of an extremely valuable — but completely intangible — aspect of your job I should understand?
  11. Describe a piece of software that gets out of the way and lets you get your work done. Now describe something that just manages to get IN your way all the time. What is the differentiator? Where does **Acme** fit in?
  12. You’ve had a tough day. You pick a song that characterizes how you feel. What song do you pick? After feeling sorry for yourself you crank up a song to move forward. What song do you pick?
  13. What “sixth-senses” do you have? How did you learn that intuition?
  14. When was the last time — outside of software vendors, but at work — that you experienced incredible customer service from a vendor? Why?
  15. A workaround is when you can’t initially get something done with the tools available, but you improvise and make things work. Describe a workaround from your work in the last month? How did you figure that out? Can you think of an **Acme** example?
  16. What is the most important lesson you’ve learned from working with YOUR customers? Any nuggets of wisdom there? How have you applied that to your day-to-day work?
  17. We all wear different hats during the day. You might be the “The Practical One” and then shift to “The Innovator” or “The Facilitator”. Imagine that you’re three different people, and that you juggle those three different personas each day. What would those hats be called? How do you act when you wear that hat? What is important to you?
  18. Most movies have that montage scene about 2/3rds of the way through when everything starts moving. It occurs immediately before the final obstacle materializes. Let’s say that movie is about your work and this organization. Tell me the story there. Walk me through the feel-good montage, and end with the big obstacle.
  19. Imagine a dream day here. Everything goes right and works smoothly. You’re in a state of flow and have a big smile on your face. Walk me through that. What is the biggest leap of faith in that description?
  20. Complete this sentence … “I hope **Acme** doesn’t screw up and ________________” . How could we become something that you hate? Where would we go wrong?
  21. How is your job performance measured formally and informally?
  22. No need to provide the details, but what are the last three big decisions you’ve had to make here? How did you go about making those decisions?
  23. What’s the last innocent — but damaging and disappointing — mistake that someone made while using **Acme**? Tell me the story there. What was the impact?
  24. Have you ever had a SFW work-related nightmare? What happened? Is it a recurring dream?
  25. Everyone has blindspots. In your opinion what is **Acme’s** blindspot when it comes to understanding you and the job you need to get done?
  26. Who do you interact with most frequently on a day-to-day basis? What are you collaborating on? What is the output?
  27. There is a major budget cut and software must go. You’re down to the bare essentials. You have to rank the importance of **Acme** between 1: Absolutely Essential and 10: Absolutely The First To Go … where are we at? Why? Who is ahead us and behind us?
  28. Describe a conversation where **Acme** came up “at the watercooler” … one positive, and one negative. What was the story?
  29. It’s Sunday and you have that sinking fear about work that’s keeping you from relaxing. What are you worrying about?
  30. What is the meat and potatoes (or veggies and seitan) of your business?
  31. You have a new employee at the company. You’re giving them the lay of the land, describing the tools they’ll use, and how they’ll use them. You have to describe **Acme**. How do you describe us to the newcomer?
  32. How would you rank the following in terms of your personality and work style. Do you prioritize: 1) Efficiency, 2) Creativity, 3) Accountability, 4) Flexibility, 5) Resilience , or 6) Influence? Why?
  33. For most jobs there is the “theoretical” way something gets done … it is nice and neat and tidy. And then the “real world” way it gets done. Can you draw me a flowchart of both? How does the real world differ?
  34. If you could automate one part of your job (and keep your job) what part would that be? What would you do with the extra time?
  35. It is twenty years ago. Replace **Acme** with a person who got this work done. What would that person’s title be? What is their job description?
  36. I’ve got ten cards here describing different things you can do with our product. Without saying anything — it’s best if we don’t talk, and remember you can’t hurt my feelings — I’d like you to draw a frowny face, smiley face, or a deadpan face on each card describing how you feel when you use that feature. And then I’d like you to sort them in terms of how important they are to your day-to-day job.
  37. Think about the other software tools you use. Fill in the blanks. Compared to ________ **Acme** is doing a great job, but compared to __________ **Acm**e has a lot to learn.
  38. **Acme** is a restaurant. What is it like eating there? What do we do well? Where do we fall flat? What is your best/worst dish?
  39. I’d like you to take a quick stab at writing the new **Acme** marketing tagline. It is short and snappy. It cuts to the chase. What is it?
  40. Times are tight and we are all busy. If you had more budget for your department, and more time to focus, what would you spend that money and time on?
  41. Imagine you’re at a meeting discussing our product. People are relaxed and speaking candidly. We’ve done a good job and have met your needs. Complete this sentence … “**Acme** has paid for itself many times over by ___________________ “.
  42. Have you ever used a piece of software that left you feeling that the developers didn’t actually try the feature? What’s that area of **Acme**? Where are we clueless? What’s a train wreck?
  43. Trust is earned. How can we earn your trust? How can we lose your trust?
  44. It’s one year from now. You’re responsible for creating a report card to decide whether to renew your contract with us. What’s on that report card? And where do we sit right now? Let’s draw it out …
  45. When was the last time you celebrated as a team because of something work related? Why?
  46. For most jobs you can let a lot of stuff slide in the short term. But there is something that simply MUST happen. If you don’t deliver in that regard you’re screwed. What is that “one thing”?
  47. This is your moment to shine. You are presenting to the whole company. You’re about to show the magic slide … the slide that rocks everyone’s world, secures your raise, and turns you into a rockstar. Can you draw it for me? What would it say? What are the three bullets?
  48. We’ve all witnessed purchasing fails over the years … that one software tool that got everyone super excited but then failed to deliver. Without naming names, could you briefly describe the “promise” (what you hoped the purchase would achieve), and then the reality when the rubber hit the road?
  49. How would you disrupt your own business if you could? You get to start over and tear it all apart. Where are things going?
  50. Describe an intractable problem from your work world … something that no amount of work, research, meetings, and discussion — formal and otherwise — can seem to fix. What is the sticking point?


# Persona(s) Non Grata

Saving the persona from itself, from selfish UX, and other tips

### Persona(s) Non Grata

#### _Saving the persona from itself, from selfish UX, and other tips_

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PYLd6uR47EKj0uaWYRT3yA.png)

An engineer once described a persona exercise as “theater camp”. I thought
about that for a while and realized what she was getting at. Here I was coming
from the UX world, running the team through a song and dance exercise with
imaginary people, stickies, and line drawings. The “creative” (me) felt
comfortable — I was in my element — but to the attendees it was like a
nightmarish new-age UX drum circle.

It’s like a wrestler doing their first yoga class. Or me doing pair
programming or trying TDD. I tell the one about role playing games being the
inspiration for personas. Crickets. My jokes fall flat.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ts7qjjGY3B7UE4FD0DA7HA.png)

[Role Playing Game Character Sheet aka
Persona](http://markdangerchen.net/papers/coordination-cooperation-and-
camaraderie-in-world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-the-role-playing-game/)

One solution is to retrench and to consider personas as the UX rallying call.
People are going to play along whether they like to or not, **embrace my
powerful UX Empathy!** But I think that is shortsighted. I’ve experimented,
and have found some things that work.

### Yes. They’re Fake

Personas have a shaky reputation among software engineers. And that’s being
generous. I’ve been in numerous situations where teams openly (and forcefully)
expressed their distrust, dislike and aversion to personas. Mini revolts
ensued and hand drawn posters faded and magically disappeared. One engineer
described personas as the “[Joe The
Plumber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_the_Plumber)”-ification of software
development. Ouch.

In the words of engineers they seem “fake”, “contrived”, “artificial”, and
“forced”. It would be easy to write this off as a lack of empathy or
imagination (which ironically is reverse lack of empathy), but in my
experience the opposite is true. Teams genuinely want to connect with users.
The reality is that personas, at least initially, are all of those things —
fake, forced, and contrived — while at the same time being extremely valuable.

> The reality is that personas, at least initially, are all of those things —
fake, forced, and contrived — while at the same time being extremely valuable.

Pick a character from a favorite book. You’re pulled in by the story. At page
one-hundred of John Steinbeck’s _Of Mice and Men _we know Lennie and George
well enough to predict impending doom when they meet Curly (and _Curly’s
Wife_). The characters are “real” because we suspend reality long enough to
embrace the fiction. Ethnographers and UX researchers do the same: suspending
surface stereotypes long enough to embrace a more complex reality after
spending weeks/months in the field.

Both take a leap of faith — to start with something wishy washy and “fake”,
stay curious, and keep digging for something more poignant and actionable. We
create a generalization as a starting point for learning. Personas are
helpful. Use them correctly and you will develop better products. Force them
on teams — “inflict” them on teams, to quote an engineer — and you’ll erode
trust, detach the team from the user/customer, and harm the end-product.

### Whip-Cracking Personas

The worst abuse of personas is when they’re used to basically tell people what
to build and who to build it for. They embody the why, who, what, and how
without any room for exploration and disagreement. Any person in their right
mind will start ignoring these and thumb their nose. In a retrospective an
engineer once exclaimed:

> You want me to spend the next three months of my life working on something
for an imaginary person you dreamed up for the kick-off deck?

The rest of this post will assume that you’re intellectually honest and
rigorous, and that you are open to engaging with your team to build a better
product. If that’s not the case, then you’ll probably get bored.

### Yes I’m Guessing

A great start is to eat the humble pie and openly acknowledge that you’re
guessing. This seems trivial, but it might not be immediately clear to the
team that you are consciously and intentionally “making believe”. These
“[proto persona](https://uxmag.com/articles/using-proto-personas-for-
executive-alignment)” (a first pass persona not based on validated
assumptions) represents your best guess at the moment. The challenge of
product development is to iteratively validate these “who” assumptions. Who is
this fictional character? What job do they do? When we’re one-hundred pages
into this book, what will we know?

How do you structure and visualize this approach? Instead of a static (and
quickly stale) persona, we’d use a Kanban board (or “canvas”) to prioritize
assumptions, and then plan and execute experiments.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*YoQirHs3SV7frdye.)

The challenge here is that openly acknowledging how little we know is not
exactly the stuff of CTO and VP of Product dreams. It makes people uneasy.
Validated experiments don’t result in deployed 1s and 0s. Teams are frequently
measured in terms of output, not outcomes. But if you foster a culture that is
failure-safe and focused on learning you’ll be surprised by the engagement
this inspires on the team.

If you’re going to make the persona (and your assumptions) visual, commit to
keep iterating on the content as the team learns. A stale persona is worse
than no persona at all.

### “Real” People

Another approach — and one I’ve found very effective regardless of
organization culture — is to focus on “real” people instead of
generalizations. This is the persona gateway drug for the uninitiated. Knowing
that this human actually exists in flesh and blood does wonders.

At first I was skeptical and braced for the valid “low N” argument (focusing
on one person is the queen of small samples). In a fit of “ok, I’ll try
personas one last time” I took pictures, video, and audio. I had the team
design their own persona template based on a collection of real humans.
Together we referred to the users by their actual names.

These “personas” — while not strict personas — came alive. Because they were
_actually alive_. The team could jump on the phone and chat with them. What
was impressive in this case was that the team had a much easier time moving
from the specific to the general. They noticed commonalities. We developed
generalized personas by going backwards — which essentially mimics how skilled
designers and marketers create personas in the first place. It was a good
example of experiencing the thinking process instead of mandating it.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ojES-hr1w2MCd0qB.)

Starting with Fake Fake People rarely gets you to Real Fake People

### Salience

People can be extremely lazy with the types of media they use for personas.
And designers are often the main culprit. They’ll create complex and beautiful
persona templates while missing out on opportunities to use video, audio, and
work product samples (e.g. spreadsheets, forms, plans, etc.) The templates are
so rigid that any new learnings are impossible to incorporate. In short,
they’re made for Show, and not Tell. Cute for portfolios, but not so helpful
for teams.

> In short, they’re made for Show, and not Tell. Cute for portfolios, but not
so helpful for teams.

Let’s say you’ve interviewed ten people and you’re starting to find some
commonality around the technology usage dimension. Consider editing down clips
of video (or audio) for that dimension and splicing it back to back. This will
drive home the point with more salience and impact. Most importantly you’re
letting the team explore the connections instead of force-feeding your biased
summary of findings. Work backwards from the specific to the general, not the
other way around.

The granddaddy of persona fastracks is the “real world” customer visit. Rent a
van and go. I’m amazed by how few product managers, let alone engineers,
actually engage with their customers and users in their offices. Your precious
UX breaks down with eleven open browser tabs, interruptions every three
minutes, and a barking boss down the hall. No slick persona can replace this
experience … especially second hand through a UX researcher or product manager
proxy. Taking a full day off away from the screen might seem like a
productivity killer. But so is building things people will never use.

In a pinch video can work too if your org is pushing back, or if visiting
customers on site is impractical. At a former gig I filmed “confessional”
style videos with twenty odd customers/users. I set the context and lowered
the customer’s guard. No topics were off limits. The end result was “loved” by
even the staunchest persona haters. It felt “real”. The same held true for
monthly customer research panels where we invited customers to speak to a room
of 15–30 engineers over lunch. Even the staunchest persona-loathers enjoyed
these sessions (and the free lunch didn’t hurt).

### Salience Part II: The Story

What excites people more: 1) knowing how old a person is and that they like
puppies, or 2) knowing that a person saved a stray puppy from freezing water
on the eve of their 30th birthday during a freak ice-storm in Wisconsin?

Check out [the period table of
storytelling](http://www.designthroughstorytelling.net/periodic/) and get lost
for an afternoon.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UPyBhXJbHufZFHYAga0Vng.png)

[Periodic Table of
Storytelling](http://www.designthroughstorytelling.net/periodic/)

The summary and bullet-pointed nature of personas is the persona achilles
heel. I remember interviewing a person who was caught in a terribly difficult
financial situation. He was terrified that he would let his elderly mother
down by mismanaging the property she had entrusted him to rent. Her care at
the assisted living facility depended on it. Now that’s real. No bullet point
can capture that. Playing the audio to the team captured it perfectly without
any platitudes about empathy.

This is why personas should be used in conjunction with customer journey maps
and other time-based visualizations and artifacts. Don’t feel limited by the
format or template of the personas. Consider storyboards, picture montages,
video montages, and more traditional journey maps.

Some of the caveats above still remain true. A “proto” customer journey map is
still a hypothesis. Making it more visual doesn’t solve that problem. But by
“working backwards” from qualitative research you can make this exercises pack
a bigger punch.

### Jobs To Be Done

Jobs-to-be-done is an interesting counterpoint to traditional personas and
something I’ve seen resonate with product development teams. I’m not sure I’m
a fan of doing away completely with personas, but I do think jobs-to-be-done
makes a great case for focusing less on the classic product marketing
wheelhouse of demographics and stateless, causality-lacking generalizations.

> These attributes, generally in the form of demographics, do not bring a team
closer to understanding a customer’s consumption, or non-consumption, of a
product. The characteristics of a Persona (someone’s age, sex, race, and
weekend habits) does not explain why they ate that Snickers bar; having 30
seconds to buy and eat something which will stave off hunger for 30 minutes
does explain why. ([Intercom](https://blog.intercom.io/using-job-stories-
design-features-ui-ux/))

With B2B you frequently encounter situations where you’ll have customer wear
different hats depending on the size of the company. Users are grouped by
needs and goals (both emotional and job-related). Imagine two CEOs, both with
similar demographics. The president of a small company might wear “all of the
hats”, while the CEO of a large company focuses on top-level decisions. The
SMB president embodies many jobs-to-be-done, least of which is trying to
manage the wrenching stress of overseeing a small business.

There is a subtle difference between

> “This person is stressed. This person is overworked.”

and

> “This person is hiring our product to reduce stress in their day and to work
more efficiently.”

A big word of caution is to put too much emphasis on official roles prescribed
in your product. What is an Administrator exactly? Are they all the same? Do
all Read Only visitors have the same needs? Don’t create personas directly
from your system-roles.

### Relationships Matter: No Persona Is An Island

A major failing of traditional personas is that they fail to describe
relationships. Relationships drive collaboration and interactions.
Relationships create product challenges that extend beyond the singular wants,
needs, and egos of individual people. And for the purpose of engaging teams
understanding relationships drives empathy and novel solutions.

Let’s say you have a golfer and a caddie. What are the inputs and outputs of
that relationship? The golfer is relying on the caddie for local knowledge and
emotional support when she shanks the ball into another fairway. The caddie is
relying on the golfer for money, for conversation (perhaps), and for regular
work. Both have a relationship with the Pro and other Golfers.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*J7yqiHDYAeKWpgk-.)

The relationship view is a much needed layer of understanding. The real
opportunities for products often exists along the edges … not at the nodes.
Work passes between people, not inside the confines of single personas. A
successful product addresses the needs of all parties. These diagrams don’t
fit into the neat and tidy persona templates, but they express a more
realistic set of assumptions.

### The Why

Observing humans is one of the great catalysts for invention and innovation.
It’s how you develop products that magically read the customer’s mind even if
they’ve asked for something entirely different. You notice the subtleties.
Your design decision batting average improves.

But as they stand personas have a bad rap. Framing personas merely on their
capacity to drive empathy is too short sighted. And frankly it also feels
elitist. It casts engineers as lacking empathy for users, when in fact they
rightfully lack an appetite for shoddy assumptions.

There’s a couple reasons why “experienced” cross-functional teams perform
better. The first is that they know when to trust and challenge their
intuition. The second is that they know how to ask better questions and that
staying curious is the key to the game. Third is that they combine techniques
and have mastered the core skills (“just code and deliver” below). Personas,
and their inherent ambiguity, definitely makes things more complicated at
first …

When working with an inexperienced team this can be a challenge for the UXer.
You know that the persona process can yield better, leaner, more simple, and
more effective product … but honestly it all feels a little hokey. Hopefully
the advice above helps, and I’d love to connect to learn what has worked for
you!

Don’t do personas for the heck of it. Build better products together.


# The Iron Triangle Is Dead

Illusions of singular org culture, intervention, and the “right way”

### The Iron Triangle Is Dead

#### Illusions of singular org culture, intervention, and the “right way”

There is something very calming about doodling in a notebook. For me, Saturday
mornings is about doodles and coffee.

The [traditional Iron Triangle](http://www.projecttimes.com/articles
/traditional-iron-triangle-vs.-agile-triangle.html) has three nodes: Scope,
Resources, and Schedule. When you talk to executives they’ll describe their
central challenges as Growth, or Innovation, or both. As product developers
we’re supposed to decide between [Building The Right Thing, Build It Fast, and
Build The Thing Right](http://yedingding.com/images/deliver-better-
product-i/KnibergRoles.jpg?1404985052).

The reality is that there are far more things at play. Contrary to the
simplifications, there are no levers … but rather fields, sinew, arcs, push,
pull, momentum, complexity, and travel. Creativity is a journey. Scale has
multiple roots. Quality doesn’t just magically materialize.

This is what I came up with ([click here for high
res](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwV5ydXhNqgiRlgzUk04VER4aEE/view?usp=sharing)).
What do you see?

### Focus Until It Hurts

To startup founders and early team members, focus can be extremely
uncomfortable. It defies many of our intuitions about customer-centricity,
risk mitigation, “working hard”, and seizing opportunities. We are by
definition opportunists and risk-takers and the list of good ideas is endless.

It’s easy to talk about focus. But much harder to BE focused.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GEu1h17A6_pm_grHkXzv-g.png)

When the lights go up …. think of all the great things we could do!

It occurred to me the other day that what we call “focus” is often way too
comfortable. It’s a bandaid on the fleshwound. We resort to familiar thought
patterns and fixes:

  * Our meetings need to be more efficient! No meetings!
  * We need better tools!
  * We need to improve our ability to communicate!
  * We need better processes! We need more accountability!
  * We need rules around emailing, chatting, and documentation!
  * We need more resources!
  * We need to be more efficient!
  * We need to protect people from distractions!
  * We need to do more planning upfront!

This is not real focus. These things address the symptoms of poor focus, not
focus itself.

Enter the dichotomy. For the doers and those on the front-lines, real focus
feels amazing. You’re in the zone, making quick decisions, and building and
selling things customers love.

For managers, leaders, and other anointed decision-makers real focus can feel
extremely painful and counterintuitive. You have to push yourself far beyond
the point of comfort just to defeat your tendencies to chase waterfalls. It
should feel **very uncomfortable and awkward.**

So what does real focus feel like? How do we know? My suggestion is to look
carefully at the team and look for evidence. A focused team …

  * **Is Safe.** Their experiments are [safe to fail](http://bounds.net.au/node/15) and individuals are free from intimidation, harassment, and discrimination. The environment supports a [growth mindset](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/) and is supportive of different learning and communication styles. (See [Anzeneering](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/anzeneering/) by Joshua Kerievsky)
  * **Has Congruency. **There are no backchannels and [scuttlebutt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuttlebutt). Bad behavior is not tolerated for political reasons. The team shares a common reality — not by force or command, but because they share a common mission and narrow focus. When a conversation involves three people … then those three people are present and involved.
  * **Says No Often**: no to meetings, no to prospects, no to partnerships, no to new tools, no to process, no to feature requests, [no to customers](http://www.inc.com/young-entrepreneur-council/9-polite-ways-to-reject-a-customer.html), and no to second choice candidates. They say no so often that they end up saying it less. This isn’t a top-down No — the manager playing wackamole in a desperate attempt at control — but rather a whole-team habit.
  * **Says Yes Quickly**. Yes means Yes, not Maybe. Individual team members can make consistently good decisions without asking for permission, navigating politics, or needing “buy-in”. No one person owns the Yes, because with crisp focus anyone can say Yes confidently.
  * C**ommunicates Openly and Respectfully**. They’re able to “get real” and speak candidly. When it doubt they meet in person and resolve differences. Focused teams also spend a lot more time talking about what they’re actually DOING — the work and what it takes to get it done — than about wishy washy future plans and ideas.
  * **Has Fewer Constraints. **Humans are terrible at juggling “yeah but”s and “but we have to consider”s. When you add constraints you increase complexity and in turn decrease the chance of getting anything meaningful done.
  * **Works Less But Deliver Better Outcomes. **They exhibit an almost boring level of productivity. Stuff just “gets done” without a lot of heat and drama. But output isn’t the end goal. That output results in better outcomes for customers, co-workers, partners, etc.
  * **Feels Flow.** Distractions fade without command-and-control or efforts to promote “efficiency, accountability, and velocity”. They exude focus and a calm energy. Work is challenging, engaging, and energizing.

Instead of trying to control culture, look for these characteristics to nudge
things in the right direction. Challenge your own intuitions about what focus
looks/feels like, and regularly engage the team in assessing the current level
of focus. Push yourself to the limit — far beyond being “a little
uncomfortable” to the point of being ruthlessly focused — and stay the course.

### To Experiment Is Human. Reality is a **cker. And The Law Of Two Feet

#### Topics: Lean Startup, Millennials, Design Thinking, Cheap Vodka, Intuit,
Craft, and Call To Arms

Spend time with most product development teams these days and you are likely
to hear a lot of talk about assumptions, hypotheses, experiments, validation,
and “tests”. The[ Lean Startup glossary](http://venturenotebook.com/post/lean-
startup-terminology) permeates mainstream startup coffee urn chit-chat,
standups, and pitch decks. [Canvasses](http://www.lean-startup-coaching.com
/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/lean_canvas_visual_management.jpg) adorn hallway
walls. The A/B tests are humming! The spin-offs like LeanUX are doing great.
All hail intellectual rigor and the scientific method!

Reddit flash. Reality is a **cker.

Yes … liberté, égalité, fraternité: the experimentation Force is strong.
Experimentation and learning is hip and cool and the millennials dig it. It’s
like college or grad school never ended. You can work at a disruptive digital
widgeteer and continue to be creative, rigorous, and true to yourself. Battle-
weary forty-somethings like me dig it also because it lets me take my work to
a more impactful, and more challenging place. It promises fewer
[HIPPOs](http://www.forbes.com/sites/derosetichy/2013/04/15/what-happens-
when-a-hippo-runs-your-company/#51893ce24847) (highest paid person’s
opinions), more craft, more honesty, less politics, and less bullshit.

This stuff is a dream come true for the doers,
[crafters](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/), and renaissance
millennials. It jumps off the shelves.

Unfortunately, the Koolaid is spiked with some [wicked cheap
vodka](http://gizmodo.com/5966569/why-cheap-booze-makes-your-hangover-so-
horrible).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ErUuStIXI2e1gL6s.)

Most organizations are structurally and culturally incapable of making it safe
for teams to experiment and occasionally fail. As companies progress out of
the do-or-die [Act 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-act_structure) of
their trajectory, their once open attitude to experimentation shifts to a
messy balancing act: making teams _believe_ they’re empowered to solve
problems (heck, it is great marketing and keeps the foosball table humming),
while at the same time executing on the assumptions and guesses of anointed
deciders.

Noise overwhelms signal, opinion overwhelms evidence, and the quest for output
overwhelms the quest for validated outcomes. What a terrible vodka hangover.
And that’s only the start …

Organizational fascia restricts movement and innovation, alignment
deteriorates, the pressure increases, the perceived need for control
increases, processes multiply, and the cycle reinforces itself (gotta love
complex systems). Experimentation and learning become afterthoughts. And then
the company accu-hires an innovation lab and starts doing hack days, longing
for its innocent childhood, skinned knees, bruises, and bright smiles (and
all).

Meanwhile, the most talented people without stock options have hit the road
(otherwise known affectionately as the “[law of two
feet](https://opensource.com/business/10/8/darwin-meets-dilbert-applying-law-
two-feet-your-next-meeting)”). The former trailblazer wanders drunkenly into
oblivion, talking about the good old days, and then joins the board of a
startup.

Craig Larmen (of [LeSS fame](http://less.works/)) scared the crap out of me at
an Agile meetup in 2015. I asked him about “bottom up” change and he flatly
explained that doing change “halfway” is worse than no change at all. In
short, making people see the forest through the trees while cutting the forest
down is worse than no change at all. You incite the inherent tendency of the
masses to embrace impactful and honest work, while not being able to dislodge
the leadership hegemony. That was a buzzkill, but I couldn’t completely
discount his argument.

This is the let down oft reported by millennials after joining vibrant
startups only to have the magic carpet pulled out from under them. And also
experienced folks after realizing that some organizational-viruses never die.
There has to be a better way, no?

This stuff is hard. It’s not a game of lip-service.

Read Suzanne Pelican’s piece [Design thinking in the corporate
DNA](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/design-thinking-in-the-corporate-dna) to
understand the gumption required for deep structural change (at Intuit). Note
also that the initiative had deep roots in CEO [Scott Cook’s
commitment](https://hbr.org/2015/01/intuits-ceo-on-building-a-design-driven-
company) to “be considered one of the most design-driven companies in the
world” by 2020. Pelican’s mention of Eric Reiss isn’t a namecheck. Intuit
doesn’t phone in its commitment to a more intellectually honest and rigorous
approach. They live and breath it (for now). Pelican writes:

> A common trap for us is to take something in its infancy and try to scale it
big. Build it. Launch it. Move on. Well, it doesn’t work like that. Remember
how long it took before you mastered design thinking? This isn’t something
that you have people try once and then expect them to get it. It takes about
six to 10 experiential, immersive, contextually relevant experiences before
someone finally “gets” it and can make it their own. Eight years later, we’re
still building this skill into our employees, one experience at a time.

Contrast that with the rigor most companies put into their experiments,
canvasses, validation, and evidence-based approaches. When they hit the
inevitable letdown, they blame the tools and methods. Mistake!

Evidence-based approaches aren’t the problem. Lean Startup combines a number
of tested methodologies. Design thinking is a solid and very time-tested
problem solving approach. [BML](http://steveblank.com/2015/05/06/build-
measure-learn-throw-things-against-the-wall-and-see-if-they-work/), the

[PDCA](http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/project-planning-tools/overview
/pdca-cycle.html) … while subtly different, would be grouped by visiting
aliens all under the same category, and categorize them as “more functional”.
They are innately human.

We’re inundated with ways — under “ideal” circumstances — to build great
products people love. My Twitter feed swims in it. The summary is basically …
“I WISH I could spend my day working like this!” These methods are humane,
rigorous, curious, and failure safe.

And then you have the whole host of “cultural change” articles that explain
how to hack organizations to make them safer for things that work _to work_.
We all seemingly want the same thing, while the “real world” folks are drawing
gantt charts, setting KPIs, and selling stuff people don’t use.

What’s the point? I want to encourage crafters (buzzy, yes), hackers, “makers”
(buzzy, yes), designers, creatives, builders, and engineers to approach their
work with passion, rigor, and curiosity. To seek out places where you are
safe, and while those places are safe to build stuff that both excites you and
benefits people. Use the _law of two feet_ to live passionately and move where
you find value. Promote a diversity-friendly, learning-safe, and failure-safe
mindset, and work to create those environments for other people. Growth does
not always imply sacrifice … if you stick stubbornly to your values anything
is possible. Basically … don’t give up!

  * Show empathy NOT indifference
  * Ask why and who NOT how and what
  * Serve teams NOT agendas
  * Be guided by principles NOT plans
  * Be a team-member NOT a team-driver
  * Focus on challenges and needs NOT titles
  * Treat teammates like creative makers NOT resources
  * Provide context and data NOT solutions and platitudes
  * Have suggestions and opinions NOT demands and fiats
  * Be curious and open NOT dismissive and stubborn
  * Harness diversity NOT conformity
  * Embrace simplicity NOT oversimplification
  * Deliver outcomes and impact NOT features and output
  * Build less NOT more
  * Be transparent NOT opaque or manipulative
  * Be accessible NOT elusive or overbearing

### How I Forced Myself To Eat Healthy Food (For 40 Days)

I write some [long Medium posts](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/to-
experiment-is-human-reality-is-a-cker-and-the-law-of-two-feet-
639ade01396a#.79wai7rot). This isn’t one of them. I’ve been meaning to share a
simple hack that has helped me get back on the healthy eating wagon.

#### Step 1

Buy gift cards from healthy lunch places (and breakfast if you tend to eat
while on the go). My favorites while here in Raleigh, NC are [Happy +
Hale](http://order.happyandhale.com/) and [Joule](http://ac-
restaurants.com/joule/).

Go big. Really big. Like $500 big:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*CmRS6p0jrCwPFBYm38sZ7g.png)

Convert the money to pieces of plastic:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1Mv5uqL2jr9JS9AO46IS5Q.png)

#### Step 2

Take photos of your gift cards. You’ll be super pissed if you lose your wallet
along with $500 in healthy food.

#### Step 3

**Eat the food.** Why not? You’ve invested this much into eating healthy. You might as well. Each morning I get the Breakfast of Champions at Joule.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Rj7PmQBG2pLjecMaOg0tzg.png)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*A8ibj_5fNqinbPidiW3TDg.png)

and for lunch, I have a salad and some protein from H+H.

That’s it. There is something about spending the money upfront that keeps you
motivated (for some people).


# Talking The Talk: 32 Conversation Prompts for Product Development Teams

### Talking The Talk: 32 Conversation Prompts for Product Development Teams

#### Topics: Learning goals. Decisions. Collaboration. Data. Experimentation.
Personal passions. And respect for diverse viewpoints.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*h-fQGOKu14ZeE5Od7e4o4g.png)

[Arnold Lakhovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Lakhovsky "Arnold
Lakhovsky" ), _The Conversation_ (circa 1935)

I’ve noticed over the years that diverse teams that communicate clearly,
honestly, and respectfully will always beat homogenous teams that struggle
with a lack of focus, trust issues, and silencing minority viewpoints. We look
for quick fixes — a new methodology, a new process, a new structure — when our
biggest challenge is creating a safe environment for sharing diverse
viewpoints. And then, literally, learning how to communicate in those
settings. (I speak more about this in my post [To Experiment Is Human. Reality
is a **cker. And The Law Of Two Feet](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/to-
experiment-is-human-reality-is-a-cker-and-the-law-of-two-feet-
639ade01396a#.nle0kxrjr))

What do high-performing product development teams sound like? What do they
talk about? How do they stay so focused?

For a while now I’ve wanted to create a deck of cards teams could use to learn
to communicate more effectively in software product development team settings.
There is a lot of material out there to help teams collaborate and communicate
more generally, but I wanted to focus in on common product development
situations.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8n-B9T5qiH_zx6RKOivOTg.png)

So here’s the first iteration …

#### Tips For Facilitators

  * **Print** the prompts and examples on card stock and make your own cards (much cheaper than Avery index card labels)
  * Create **a safe space** that is friendly to curiosity, passion, and empathy. Set the scene by reminding participants that there are no stupid answers
  * **Scope the discussion**. Pick a specific product development effort
  * Underscore that as a team you’re **practicing patterns** that can be applied in new settings. So there is a specific application — the effort at hand — and more general applications
  * **Use the cards as you see fit**: team members can pick from the top, work as groups on a set of cards, get dealt cards, “pass the trash” to get answers from other people, etc.

#### Tips For Team Members

Be specific whenever possible. Relate things to your observations, your
experience, your perspectives, and your needs. Be in the present. Discuss the
current situation and decisions at hand. Be honest with your intentions. Stay
curious.

When in doubt, remember the STATE acronym (from [Crucial Conversations Tools
for Talking When Stakes Are
High](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K0AYH4/ref=dp-kindle-
redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1)):

  * **S**hare your facts
  * **T**ell your story
  * **A**sk for others’ paths
  * **T**alk tentatively
  * **E**ncourage testing

### The Prompts

And here they are … to be improved, but “in print”

* * *

I’m concerned that if we **________**, we may miss the opportunity to
**________**.

Example: I’m concerned that if we **spend too long deliberating over the
behavior of the page filter**, we may miss the opportunity to **test early
with customers**.

* * *

To feel more confident about our decision to **________**, I would like to
observe **________**

Example: To feel more confident about our decision to **add steps to the
workflow**, I would like to observe **more customers completing the existing
workflow**

* * *

My primary reason for advocating for **________** is that I care deeply about
**________**

Example: My primary reason for advocating for **the enhanced error messaging**
is that I care deeply about **the user experience, and preventing customer
frustration**

* * *

A missing voice here is the voice of **________.** This will heavily impact**
________.** We should explore **________** perspective

Example: A missing voice here is the voice of **Roger from customer success.**
This will heavily impact** him and the customers he works with by saddling
them with a difficult to use feature.** We should explore **his** perspective

* * *

I feel strongly that if we **________** it will negatively impact **________**
by **________**

Example: I feel strongly that if we **release without IE support** it will
negatively impact **our less technically savvy customers** by **introducing a
painful user experience**

* * *

In my opinion, learning more about** ________** would have the greatest impact
on focusing the team

Example: In my opinion, learning more about** the customer mental model for
organizing their scheduled meetings** would have the greatest impact on
focusing the team

* * *

One way to test this “in the wild” (with live customers and their data) would
be to **________**. By capturing data on **________ **we could decide whether
to **________**.

Example: One way to test this “in the wild” (with live customers and their
data) would be to **create a feature toggle and show a small % of our
customers the new functionality**. By capturing data on **column sorting
behavior** we could decide whether to **optimize our queries**.

* * *

Before adding **________** I’d like to learn more about **________** so that I
can decide **________**

Example: Before adding **a new API endpoint** I’d like to learn more about
**any potential customer security concerns** so that I can decide **whether to
anonymize visitor data in the response**

* * *

The most valuable learning we could take from this project and leverage in
other areas of the product would be the fact that **________**. An immediate
application of that learning would be to **________**.

Example: The most valuable learning we could take from this project and
leverage in other areas of the product would be the fact that **our users
select system roles that are far out of alignment with their actual “real
world” roles**. An immediate application of that learning would be to **try to
survey our users to capture their “real world” roles**.

* * *

A blindspot in our current understanding is whether **________. **To learn
more about this we could **________** and observe **________**.

Example: A blindspot in our current understanding is whether **our customers
really need XLS export instead of a simple CSV export. **To learn more about
this we could **add a dummy option for XLS export to the existing menu** and
observe **how many people select it who previously were not using our CSV
export option**.

* * *

A signal that would serve as a leading indicator of success in this situation
would be that we noticed **________**. As things ramped up I’d expect to see
**________**, with data indicating a **________**.

Example: A signal that would serve as a leading indicator of success in this
situation would be that we noticed **more users exploring and testing the new
Appointments tab**. As things ramped up I’d expect to see **a small set of
users adopt the auto-scheduler**, with data indicating a **shift of between
80–100% of their appointments away from manual scheduling**.

* * *

In the past I have observed that **________**. This impacts my current point
of view on our decision to **________**

Example: In the past I have observed that **our customers have very different
behaviors when visiting our app from a mobile device **. This impacts my
current point of view on our decision to **expand the primary navigation with
more items**

* * *

At the end of the day, I’d really like to say that I **________**. That’s the
personal contribution I care most about. As a team, I’d hope we’d **________**
with data showing **________**.

Example: At the end of the day, I’d really like to say that I **got the
endless scroll working smoothly**. That’s the personal contribution I care
most about. As a team, I’d hope we’d **make the whole feed experience more
user-friendly** with data showing **increased repeat engagement**.

* * *

The next important decision I need to make is to decide whether to
**________**, or to **________**

Example: The next important decision I need to make is to decide whether to
**spend more time optimizing page load time**, or to **move on to refactoring
the image resizing logic**

* * *

I primarily want to contribute by **________**. I’d prefer to be less involved
with** ________**

Example: I primarily want to contribute by **listening in on some customer
interviews**. I’d prefer to be less involved with** observing usability
testing**

* * *

While I trust Amira to decide **________**, I think that decision would
benefit from us having more data about **________ **because** ________**

Example: While I trust Amira to decide **whether to continue iterating on the
address book**, I think that decision would benefit from us having more data
about **current usage among power users **because** power users have many more
contacts**

* * *

I could contribute more if I understood exactly why **________** are
advocating for **________**

Example: I could contribute more if I understood exactly why **Dan and Trish**
are advocating for **the inclusion of trial customers in the on-boarding
experiment**

* * *

From my perspective, the riskiest assumption we are making at the moment is
**________**. If we’re wrong, that will impact us by **________**.

Example: From my perspective, the riskiest assumption we are making at the
moment is **that users will recommend the service so quickly**. If we’re
wrong, that will impact us by **making it difficult to hit our user
acquisition targets**.

* * *

It feels as if the greatest tension here is between **________** and
**________**

Example: It feels as if the greatest tension here is between **shipping early
to meet the end of quarter sales objective** and **spending more time on

# Getting The All-Hands Right

Can you really run an effective all-hands meeting each week? Is it worth it?

* * *

### **Getting The All-Hands Right**

Can you really run an effective all-hands meeting each week? Is it worth it?

I think so. Meetings don’t kill companies. Valueless meetings kill companies
(and individual motivation). In 1999, what was Google thinking? Shouldn’t they
have been working?

In this post I offer some tips for all-hands meetings. They’re biased to my
experiences and personal viewpoints.

#### **How Often?**

I read [this answer on Quora](https://www.quora.com/In-startups-how-often-
should-you-have-all-hands-team-meetings) that fired my spidey sense:

> Meetings pull people off of **important tasks **and **slow productivity**.
If people aren’t on the same page, I would look at project management and
other management techniques being used in the organization and have team
leaders convey **important informatio**n. I would use the all hands meeting
for only big things like a **merger, change in benefits, serious HR issues**.

Hmmm. Is productivity the goal? Or efficacy? What are these “management
techniques”? Should “team leaders” be the sole conduits for “important
information”. And imagine how cool that meeting will be when they announce the
merger, change the benefits, or address the serious HR issues. Joy!

I’m not about to say that weekly meetings are must. That’s a big investment
and something you need to work hard to make valuable. But I would suggest
holding them MORE often than is immediately comfortable. Stick to your guns.
They can be improved and be made more valuable. Here are some examples (and
stories) of companies that hold weekly meetings:

  * Google (Alphabet): [Weekly](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/passion-not-perks.html)
  * Pardot: [Weekly](http://davidcummings.org/2016/01/21/develop-a-meeting-rhythm/)
  * Twitter: [Weekly “Tea-Time](http://mashable.com/2016/01/29/twitter-employees-rally/#boBjCdveU5qy)”. Note the situation in this link:

[Source](https://twitter.com/WillStick/status/692775729235296256/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

#### **Be Proactive. Not Reactive**

It’s painfully obvious when leaders are holding an all-hands to address rising
discontent vs. holding to a cadence. If there is not enough regular “news”,
then you’re likely not moving quickly enough or creating enough impact. Stick
to a cadence and defend it. [David Karp (Tumblr founder and CEO) was quoted as
saying](http://bijansabet.com/post/16814688304/weekly-all-hands-meeting):

> One of my biggest regrets is waiting until we were about 20 people to start
holding regular weekly All Teams. Getting up there in front of so many people
I adored was overwhelming, and my first attempt was hardly inspiring. I
realized I could have had three years of practice, and a chance to work my way
up to the big team, if I’d started earlier.

#### Don’t Micromanage The Message. Let It Emerge.

Myth, ritual, and narrative are incredibly powerful, but they are difficult to
manufacture or fake. Ask carefully … what priorities are you truly embodying
(and mythologizing) in your all-hands meetings? What is the story? What is the
talk that is walked?

Executives often see all-hands meetings as “alignment builders”. The advice is
to keep it “efficient”, stick to the agenda, and monitor every word to “stay
on message”. To many employees this will come off as too slick and controlled.
Let it be messy. Let it be unscripted. Tell the story. Connect. An “efficient”
meeting message can be easily communicated by other means. But myths, ritual,
and narratives can’t.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*heqTiupFvKOa8B7VH7Cknw.png)

<http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/anthropology/21a-212-myth-ritual-and-symbolism-
spring-2004/>

#### **Engage Introverts (And Mere Mortals)**

Only the most vocal people will speak up in front of the whole company. How do
you engage the mere mortals and the introverts? Set up an anonymous
“topic/question inbox” and always address one (or more) of these issues.
Always. Make them public before the meeting. Relying on your direct reports to
communicate back the water cooler talk is a risky proposition. Go straight to
the source.

#### **Skip Status-Checky Stuff**

Don’t waste time communicating financials or dry progress-to-goal updates.
This is far better communicated in a shared presentation or email. Or video.
Those interested in the nuts and bolts will read on their own time. The time
is too precious for relaying information that is equally comprehensible (or
perhaps MORE comprehensible) in written form. Why isn’t this information
simply available for all who care?

The risk of communicating this in meetings is that you’ll either oversimplify
for the audience — missing valuable angles — or go over most people’s heads.
Hit the key points and move on. Focus on the important variances.

#### **Share The Stage**

Let non-executives / non-managers speak for 40–60% of the time. They are your
rockstars. This sends the right message. Inspiration can come from all areas
of the company. I’ve seen UXers, Business Analysts, Marketers, Engineers, and
Salespeople absolutely wow large companies. Consider that Google allocates 50%
of all-hands time to QA.

Who will share the stage?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*e-8U0wBLxOm_4aDly-PrBQ.png)

<http://www.uxforthemasses.com/improve-ux-presentations/>

#### **No Tech Issues**

Deal with technical issues when involving remote workers. Have a backup
option. Test the equipment. Have an open chat. Use quality microphones. Get a
good quality video camera. It all matters.

#### **Record The Meeting**

On any given day you’ll have team members sick, on the road, or otherwise
unavailable. You might also have virtual employees in a different timezone.
Don’t leave them out. A side benefit is that you can go back and critique how
the meeting flowed. To engage their remote employees and leave them feeling
like part of the team, [HelpScout replaced their all-hands with a video
update](https://www.helpscout.net/blog/video-updates/).

#### **Share Wins, Losses, and Learnings**

It is incredibly important to make vulnerability, failure, and learning from
your mistakes “safe” in your organization. Doing so in public sends a strong
message, especially if leaders address their own missteps. Vulnerability (and
humor) brings people together.At Etsy, [all-hands meetings begin with an
opening talent act by an employee](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-etsy-
does-all-hands-meetings-2015-6). That’s a sign of a safe environment.
Information should move both ways.

General Stanley McChrystal (leader of the Joint Special Operations Task Force
from to 2003 until 2008) was known to run inspiring **DAILY** huddles. How did
he make those meetings valuable? [An INC magazine describes his
strategy](http://www.inc.com/ilan-mochari/genearl-mcchrystal-meetings.html):

> _By continuing to share his own news — good and bad — and being
nonjudgmental toward the other brave sharers. He also made the meetings as
fast — and filled with can’t-miss discussions — as they could possibly be. If
a particular individual had a four-minute speaking slot, the “update” portion
of his slot was limited to the first minute. The rest was open-ended dialogue,
which Silverman says helped “in creating a shared consciousness.” That is, the
units began to learn more about how their own projects fit in with the whole.
Moreover, the updates had to be about the present day. “No one wanted to hear
what you’d done in the last war,” the co-authors write._

#### **Make The Meeting Optional**

There should be no stigma around missing the all-hands. Some people simply
don’t care. Meetings just aren’t their thing. Others have lost interest. And
that’s a valuable data point.

#### **Return To Past Issues**

Have teams “groom” a small set of initiatives that deserve a regular update.
Keep this list fluid and relevant. But return to old topics to provide an
update. One common complaint about all-hands is that they aren’t “two way” and
don’t answer prior questions. If you mention a projection in an earlier
meeting, make sure to close the loop. This gives an expectation of
continuitity. Topics come full circle.

#### **Mind The Timing**

Monday’s tend to drag. Teams are not in the right headspace to tackle a
lengthy meeting with a big workweek ahead of them. Mornings beat sleepy
afternoons. Friday afternoons are a wash. “Branch day” can cause major
distractions for dev teams. You’ll never find the perfect time, but there are
terrible times. Avoid them.

<https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/ahotbrewwillseeyouthrough>

#### **Meeting, Measure, Learn**

Typical negative responses to all-hands meetings include “too frequent”, “not
relevant”, “no new information, and “boring”. This is vague and hard to
quantify. Instead, send out regular anonymous surveys regarding the all-hands
meeting and monitor trends in those results. The kneejerk response to these
surveys is to make the meetings less frequent. Instead, consider sharing
meeting feedback at a subsequent all-hands and take steps to adapt and
experiment.

What has worked for you? When a frequent all-hands meetings not a good idea?
What do you do if the meetings simply don’t drive value?

### A Better Roadmap | Mind-Map | Mousetrap

#### This post is a summary of [this video on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8Xlrd2QGmU&feature=youtu.be). Check
it out!

Hint: Open in YouTube for a larger HD view.

* * *

Have you ever heard (or said) the following:

> “I don’t understand the big picture!”

> “I don’t understand how my work fits into the big picture!”

> “We are working in opposition to each other. We need better alignment”

We know the standard solutions. How about a better roadmap? Or a list of major
goals? Or another company all-hands? Or a new mousetrap?

### **The Problem**

Strategy/roadmaps overviews:

  * rarely explain rationale
  * differentiate assumptions and facts, or degrees of certainty
  * fail to explain causality, and linkages
  * fail to link tactics and strategy

They tend to read like a list of to-dos.

**Things slip.** Despite our best efforts it is difficult to understand the “big picture”. The strategy lacks coherence. We slip into the weeds of horse-trading pet solutions and the “why” is quickly forgotten. This in turn saps creativity and focus, as teams clash and generate noise. Most insidiously, it becomes nearly impossible to understand the root assumptions behind high level goals and individual interpretations. Shared understanding is never captured adequately. Laying it all against a calendar doesn’t help. Reviewing it doesn’t help.

### **The (Proposed) Solution**

In this post I’ll present a mind-mapping method to create that shared
understanding. While technically it is pretty simple, this level of
transparency can be challenging. It isn’t for everyone. But if you push
through, you’ll end up with a far richer understanding of what underpins the
roadmap or strategy. Why does this approach work?

  * It provides an “audit” of our reasoning
  * It explains our logic, assumptions, and data
  * It can be viewed at multiple “resolutions” for clarity
  * It “nests” well … the form can be nested inside itself

#### **The Basics**

Most goals have a “why”, some constraints, and some proposed solutions. I call
these Because, While/Without, and By. We’ll repeat these throughout the mind-
map.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*nzHBM1ylBXCLtK2K.)

Goals, Because (Why), While/Without, and By

#### An Example

I’m short on cash and my friend is coming to town tomorrow.

#### **Because**

I need to make $70 by tomorrow evening so I can take my visiting friend Bill
out to dinner. This is my “why”. We use “because” as it helps us form coherent
sentences inside the mind-map.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ArYivwgy1VlOI8Jc.)

We specify a Because

#### **While / Without**

These are not solutions, but they guide our selection of a solution. We use
“without” when we assume or know we don’t want to (or can’t) do something. We
use “while” when we assume or know that we will do something alongside the
solution. Here I list some potential constraints:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Or107y94C41XPzIF.)

We list our constraints

#### **While / Without Because**

Each of these constraints has an underlying assumption. We make sure to
differentiate between things we know, and things we assume. For example, I
can’t do physical labor because I **know **I hurt my back. I **assume** travel
could be expensive (or too time consuming), but who knows … maybe a friend
will give me a ride. We specify these using the following format:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*82X3iALLAwDRW1pV.)

Each of these constraints has their own assumptions

#### **By**

Now that we have a clear understanding of the why and constraints, we dream up
some potential solutions. We could start a lemonade stand, do some freelance
web work, or borrow the money.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*s7ekH2oKdVA07wQ3.)

Potential solutions

Lemonade Stand is looking like a good option. I repeat our **Because / While-
Without / By** form for this solution.

#### **Because and While/Without**

The forecast says it will be hot tomorrow. And I’d like to avoid using
powdered lemonade … first because I hate the taste myself, and second because
I assume people will feel cheated. Again I start with Because and
While/Without. I hate the taste of powdered lemonade (and I think it will
leave customers bummed) so I make sure to specify that:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*CbdL-yVEBKLksRAY.)

It looks like the weather will be hot. And I hate the taste of powdered
lemonade

#### **By and By ___ Because**

Our “solution” also has solution details, and these have underpinning
assumptions. In this case I’ve made an assumption about what I can charge, my
overhead, my location, and my product (fresh squeezed lemonade). My assumption
is that $1 will hit the sweetspot.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*3H-cvImu_R5evCO0.)

Our solutions ALSO have underlying assumptions

#### **Overview**

Here is the completed mind-map for my goal of making $70 today. This could be
easily handed to someone and the story would be told.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*kAn3K-9R1cLf06vL.)

Going from a goal of making $70 to the details of the lemonade stand

### **Real-World Example**

This can be applied to many types of business (and general problem solving)
situations:

Take a SaaS company hoping to hit an ARR (annual recurring revenue) goal.
Because sale’s goals are finicky and potential disruptive, we balance the goal
with constraints. In this example we make sure to point out that we don’t want
to sacrifice employee morale, or to stop innovating.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*J5g-RFZoXxRw7cNV.)

Sales Goals are potentially dangerous unless mitigated

We add assumptions to those constraints. In this case the sales goal is offset
by a limit on the acceptable level of professional services income, first
because it might distract the team, and second because it could sap employee
morale.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*hzHHgN5-wieIblQq.)

Turns out that some revenue isn’t investor friendly

We add other constraints including employee morale, continuing innovation, and
the all important churn/renewal goal (to offset overly ambitious sales
tactics). And then we proceed to list solutions. We start with Sales and
Marketing, but would eventually list product initiatives.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*APW7dSWMSz6fxWku.)

With the constraints listed, we move on to the proposed solutions

* * *

And that’s that. It isn’t complicated … but it requires patience and
conversation. Using this format can help a team battle voids in shared
understanding and come up with something that is coherent and actionable.

Please let me know if this works for you!


# Team Health: A Daily Checkup

I hear people talking all the time about “measuring” product development

* * *

### Team Health: A Daily Checkup

I hear people talking all the time about “measuring” product development
teams. Do we measure velocity, value delivered, or bugs removed / introduced?
But what if you flipped the script? What if teams devised their own daily
check-in to gauge their performance? What if they focused on great leading
indicators of success and health, and used those measures to guide continuous
improvement efforts?

I think you’d see something very different emerge. As individuals we care for
our health. As teams we should do the same.

Here’s a simple model for a daily check-in. [I’ve created a spreadsheet
version in Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hUet-
D9RLR7ctg6-KW9SNNrYRbL5-zYwt9eCYxLbokE/edit?usp=sharing). Feel free to make a
copy of it and use as you see fit.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Q7NvVjfvs3dvDzOe.)

Find this spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hUet-
D9RLR7ctg6-KW9SNNrYRbL5-zYwt9eCYxLbokE/edit?usp=sharing)

I’ve included the questions below with some background. The spreadsheet has a
simple weighted scoring system.

* * *

**Today our team:**

**Had two hours of uninterrupted time to work? **How can any team function if their time is being continuously interrupted? Before you know it the whole day has slipped away. Two hours is an ideal chunk of time. Hammering out two chunks of two hours each is a major accomplishment in a distraction-filled environment.

**Had a conversation with a customer (or group of customers) involving &gt;1 member of your team? **Why silo the front-line from customers? It may seem more efficient to let people act as an interface. But in my experience that just encourages hoarding of data, and introduces signal loss as information is filtered through to the builders and makers. Regular contact with customers improves intuition and encourages empathy.

**Discussed facts about customer needs, usage, etc.(vs. assumptions, guesses, predictions)?** Are your meetings filled with guesses? Guesses are cheap. Shift the conversation to facts and data and meetings suddenly become a lot more productive (and even fun).

**Learned something new? **If the team is not learning — about customers, the domain, their technology, or themselves — then they’re slipping backwards. Learning new things is stimulating. It makes your current job worth it, and sends you packing if it isn’t happening.

**Applied a recent learning**? To hone a skill you must apply it. Did you apply a recent learning today? Not something you learned in high school — that’s cool too — but something you learned in the last couple weeks.

**Had an energetic / whole-team discussion about something related to work (&gt;10 minutes)? **We’ve all experienced those spontaneous conversations with our team. They aren’t forced. They need no official meeting to emerge. Everyone just spins around in their chair and starts having a good face-to-face conversation.

**Celebrated a win that resonated on a professional and personal level? **Most milestones don’t really resonate. A sense of impact is largely personal. How many team members experienced a win today?

**Felt in the “zone”, a state of flow, challenged but effective?** [Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29) is a great feeling. Time flies. The work is challenging but achievable. You don’t feel like you’re trashing. Anti-flow comes in many forms — negative dynamics, interruptions, lack of mission, and poor tooling. How many members of your team were in the “zone” today? In my experience this is contagious. When it’s “game on” everyone benefits.

**Participated in some kind of pairing activity? **Structured pairing can feel oppressive (especially if forced and mandated). But working alongside someone for some period of time can be a positive experience. Doing this cross-functionally (UX and engineering, for example) can yield awesome results.

**Had an honest discussion about what has and what has not been working (&gt;10 minutes)**? Can the team “be real”. Did they get real? If so, this is a good sign. It is almost impossible to continuously improve if their is not a level of openness, trust, and safety.

**Made some sort of high leverage, reusable, accessible, and necessary contribution (internal facing)? **Not all work is customer facing. Sometimes we take the bull by the horns and improve an internal tool, or process. The work has a large benefit for the rest of the team.

**Enjoyed a moment of brevity and humor, experienced by a majority of team members simultaneously?** Have fun! The other day a joke on our team started on Slack and ended in a full team laugh. That’s powerful. If you can’t have fun together, it is unlikely you’ll be able to weather the dips of product development.

How would you adapt this list for your environment? Let me know if the

# How To Tame Engineers, Be A Rockstar, and Ship ****ing Product

Introduction

* * *

### How To Tame Engineers, Be A Rockstar, and Ship ****ing Product

### Introduction

As product managers it is time we take a stand. Times are changing, and not in
our favor. DevOps, UX, Agile, Design Thinking, Growth Hacking, Data Science …
WTF? When did we lose our hold of the reigns? We need to fight back. We need
to regain our honor. We need to ship ****ing product. And to do that we need
to learn how to control engineers.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*k0DySgE8CxPlO_h3zIBX4g.png)

Tom Cruise as Frank T.J. Mackey in Magnolia

Engineers start their careers with a spark. They want to build things that
make a difference. The problem is that their caring and passion causes a lot
of problems. It slows us down. It makes being a manager of product, um,
challenging. Is there an alternative?

Yes!

Our goal here is to have engineers care about engineering, but not get in our
way. In other words, care enough to keep working very hard, but not to ask too
many questions or push back. To be successful we want engineers to relish
their craft, and to take pleasure delivering exactly what we want them to
deliver.

I’m going to share a secret. Engineers have a defense mechanism. They like
building things and they like writing code. Engineers can exist wonderfully
without really having any say in the product. Things will be rough at first.
They’ll huff and puff and complain about the product team, and then go home
and pick out an outfit for Comic-Con. It will pass. And your agenda will
remain unscathed. Why? Because they genuinely love what they do. How novel.

Yes. This is your Product School. Here are the keys to the kingdom. I feel
almost dirty sharing these time-honored secrets. Learn the skills below and
you’ll smash any desire to meddle.

You will ship ****ing product.

### **1\. Master Of Ceremony**

Conduct very elaborate ceremonies! Some teams have “sprint demos”. These are a
perfect vehicle to exert your power and influence. Deliberate slowly as the
team demos each feature. Really play up the fact that you’re the “approver”.
Use this opportunity to make it uncomfortable for engineers who fall out of
line. Relish in the approver role. Toss in a bit of discouragement here and
there along with some barely believable encouragement. Remember, we’re trying
to incubate productive apathy here folks.

### 2\. International Woman Of Product Mystery

Let’s face it it. You spend a lot of your day in boring meetings. But why
spill the beans? Add some mystery. Disappear into available conference rooms,
cell-phone in hand. You have to cultivate a persona here, which means the no
one wants to hear about you checking Facebook while you wait for GoToMeeting
to load. Or giving status checks to people who can’t be bothered to read a
tweet-length email update. No. You are an International Woman Of Product
Mystery, and meetings are where the action really happens.

### 3\. Own Your Stakeholders

Giving the team too much access to stakeholders is simply unacceptable. How
will you ever cultivate your soft skills? You, and only you, “manage” the
stakeholders. When it helps your cause — for example you want to impress a
stakeholder with your smart engineer friends — then it is appropriate to
mingle.

Invite stakeholders to the sprint demo as well. The key here is owning the
channel. Protect it at all costs. One slick tip here is to constantly
reiterate to the team how little these business types know about software
development. Huff a little. Complain about marketing being marketing, and
sales being sales. No one will want to deal with these folks after you are
done. You will OWN the channel. I promise.

### 4\. Pressure Applied Unevenly

Pressure should not work both ways. Take test-driven development. We ask
engineers to test software, and make sure things work. This is binary. It
works, or it doesn’t work. That rigor is uncomfortable, and not something we
want to experience. That is their world, not your world. Features don’t tank.
They “miss the mark”. Priorities shift because that’s how the world works, not
because we were too busy fixing our Mac after we broke everything trying to
install Python. We are the fortune tellers. We are the soothsayers. Our work
does not “pass” or “fail”. Make this clear, and you’ll dash interest in our
side of the house.

### 5\. Own The Problem. Choose The Solution

“We own defining the problem!” By assigning yourself the noble task of
defining the problem, you’ve basically written yourself a pass. Understanding
the domain is our business. It’s our special skillset. The engineers are
crafters and builders. They are the solvers (or at least they think so). Lucky
for us it is possible to turn our pet solutions into problem definitions. We
can tire the team out until they acknowledge our genius. The irony here is
that we never really truly understand the problem to solve, and our solution
often informs other problems. But that’s a detail. It’s too complicated. There
are problem definers, and solution builders, and we know our destiny. Control
both!

### 6\. Hackdays. Mother Of Pragmatism

Hackdays are great for hiring videos and angst deflection. When people start
giving you a hard time about your pet projects, make sure to remind them about
the upcoming hackday. Hackdays signal innovation. And fun. And kegerators. And
a sense of unbridled impact. But common sense says … every day can’t be like
hackday because that would be anarchy! People would build things quickly and
deliver them to customers within 5 days or 24hrs. PMs would be out of a job.
Let hackday be your carrot. Dangle it. A couple cycles of the harsh comedown —
that moment when you return from hackday to your unglamorous sales-driven
feature request — and your engineers will be compliant.

### 7\. Tamper With The Evidence

Censor all feedback that will invalidate your case. Crush it like Joe
McCarthy. Scan that feedback and filter out all disconfirming data. We may
live in a democracy, but since when is democracy transparent? Opacity is the
goal. The project is airtight. Customers have been consulted. The stars have
aligned. Our intuition reigns supreme. Please follow my lead.

### 8\. They Call This “Experimentation”

Everyone wants to experiment! They experimented in the 60s. Engineers are
science minded people. They love rigor. Use this to your advantage by
suggesting that people do exactly what you want them to do as an experiment.
Then don’t follow up on whether the experiment was successful or not. It’s
awesome! You get what you want right away, but leave people a tad bitter about
experimentation. They’ll withdraw back into their craft and code, leaving
endless product management possibilities.

### 9\. Voce del Cliente

Tout up models that cast product as the “voice of the customer”. Product
people love people (of course). Engineers love machines. Engineers don’t
really understand people, otherwise they wouldn’t be engineers. We love
people. If we didn’t we could be engineers also. But we love people too much.
Please, get with the stereotypes.

You want people to be a little scared of engineers. What would we do if we
didn’t have product managers here to keep them building the right stuff?
Remember that one time an engineer went rogue with a feature? Exactly. We run
the risk of that happening at all times. It is a constant threat.

### 10\. Flat Is Unfriendly. I’ll Have A Tall …

We want to play up politics in our organization. A flat company is unfriendly
to product managers. What would we do all day if we weren’t playing telephone
between all of these holders-of-stake? Sure we want a happy environment.
That’s great. More work gets done. But we want to foster a glass ceiling of
sorts. Engineers … resistance is futile. Don’t stress trying to rock the boat.

### 11\. The Project Factory, Estimates, and Velocity

We need estimates even if those estimates are always wrong. When things take
longer than expected we can always blame the team. Measure velocity as well!
Because velocity is the only thing coming between you and your next killer
release. The beauty here is that it all distracts people from measuring YOU!

Optimize your team 24–7. Push them to the brink of overutilization. Shift them
off of efforts over and over again just to eek out every little moment of
slack. If you do this enough they’ll just expect that you’re going to do that
… and you’ll be able to pull them off of future projects at a moment’s notice.

Status checks make people feel like they are working on a factory line. And we
like that. Because we value delivery. A well timed status check can sink
hearts. But they’ll come around … because they’ll start playing the game as
well! Remember, keep your eyes on the prize. Shipping ****ing product.

Work with UX to get things designed way in advance. That way you can show up
the morning after a big push — when everyone is eager for the data, and to
start iterating — and then announce the NEXT project. There’s no time for
dawdling. Those Mocks need building. Someone has to get that work done!
Announce confidently that the team is at risk of missing the “market window”.
“We just have to execute!”

### 12\. Data Is Not My Mistress (I Love PPT)

De-prioritize collecting data. Data has a tricky way of shining a light on
what you’re doing, and we don’t want that. What you DO want is to selectively
pick out the data points that let you do exactly what you want to do.
Transparency is not the goal. Take control of the tools. Own the analytics
software. Hold the keys. There is a major exception … at the end of a project
when somehow you cherry pick a wonderful up-and-to-the-right chart for the
board deck. Ride that freighttrain to a new job in biz-dev or market
validation.

### 13\. You Say Debt. I Say …

When teams talk about technical debt, usability debt, the national debt, the
debt limit, debtors, or anything else debt-related make sure to look a bit
distracted. Wax poetically about needing to pay the piper. And then pass the
debt on to the next generation. Or throw them a bone and do a greenfield
project until they get bored of that because DevOps is busy with the “main”
environment.

### 14\. MVPs

A great way to level set expectations with a team is to ship a super crappy
feature that no one is excited about (known as the MVP). Promise that you’ll
iterate on it, but don’t iterate on it. This is sneaky. Because on one hand
the concept of an MVP — as an experiment, and a way to deliver an early
hypothesis — is appealing to engineers. So you get their hopes up! But then
dash them. “MVPs that get iterated on only happen in the movies”. We do real,
pragmatic work here. Namely shipping what I want to ship.

### 15\. Hard Skills Are For Folks On The Spectrum

Don’t pick up too many hard skills. Especially around data science or other
things like that. Because then you’ll actually be needed by the team, and that
will take up all of your time. The team will spend less time advancing your
career. You want to be skilled in the things that engineers simply cannot do
(because they’re too smart). What if an engineer hears someone talking
bullshit? They might actually call them on it! Or playing the political game?
No engineer will put up with that crap. Their loss, your GAIN!

### 16\. Fan The Flames Of Dysfunction

The need for product management has a linear relationship with organizational
dysfunction. As dysfunction increases, so too does the need for PMs. The
greater the lack of focus, the more PMs you need. The more people distracting
the product, and trying to do a million things at once … YUP!, the more PMs
you need. You want a sea of competing priorities because only PMs can stir
this unctuous soup.

### 17\. Our Values Rock!

Tout organizational values that are extremely powerful and engaging. It’s
great for hiring. And then transgress those values repeatedly. Play up the
dichotomy. You might lose some folks in the process — even some of your best
people (the 5–10% who really care about the mushy stuff) — but what you’ll be
left with is a bunch of people who aren’t too bothered by the sappy stuff
and/or can’t afford to hit the road. That’s perfect. By exploding their bubble
of optimism and altruism you’ll be able to get down to business. We need to
ship ****ing product.

### 18\. Best Foot Forward

Structure your product team such that no one really feels empowered. They’re
taking orders from the top anyway. This wears the engineers out and flushes
any desire for direct impact. Alas, they’re just too distint from the center
of decision making. Which in turn frees you up for world domination. Hire
compliant PMs as well. You don’t want anyone going rogue and empowering their
team as that will set a bad example for the rest of the organization.

### 19\. Just Because…

Nothing puts an engineer in their place better than saying something vague
like “it’s complicated”, or “it is a juggling act”, or “it was a tradeoff”.
Even better is the phrase “just because”. That’s a great one. It really
hammers home that there is this strange alternate reality where the best ideas
don’t win, political clout is valued over intelligence and skills, and there
is no proof in the pudding. Never mind that engineers make cost/benefit
decisions every ten minutes. That’s too concrete for this discussion.

### 20\. Master Of Meetings

It is very important to arrive at all team meetings five minutes late, and
then to appear distracted, typing on your computer, answering emails, and
partially listening to the team. UNTIL it comes time for estimates at which
point you jump into action and pay rapt attention. Then run off very quickly
because you’ve got another meeting. This is a surefire way to make sure no one
wants any part of this PM business. They’ll leave that crap to you!

Another tactic is to always be running off to meetings where you’re going to
decide the future of the team. Without them being there. Works every time.

Schedule meetings during your team’s most productive time. Overwhelm the team
with meetings. Eventually someone like the CTO is going to say “we can’t have
so many meetings”. Leaders will go off and espouse efficient meetings. How is
this a benefit?

Firstly, you will not waste as much time with your team in meetings. They’ll
build faster. You can spend more meetings advancing your career, and making
plans without the team. People become so sick of meetings, that they’ll
associate collaboration with meetings. YES! Success. We want them to hate
meetings, put on their headphones, and work on what I tell them to work on.

### 21\. A Big Batch Of Ship-ass

Remember, from a PM’s perspective you don’t really win from the little things.
You win from the BIG things. Like Texas Big. You want to have a lot of fanfare
around your releases. Don’t try these little itty/bitty improvements. No …
take on big batches of work. It’s less work for you (less releases to manage).
When things go sideways you can always blame the team, and then take credit
for whipping things back into shape.

### 22\. Scrum. Meet The Intern

Scrum is great because Scrum will make sure you need a whole lot of junior
product “owners” if you plan to scale. You have all these teams and every team
NEEDS a PO. By doing this you set low expectations. It’s not like you were
planning to mentor them before throwing them to the wolves. Were you? Most
definitely not, otherwise you would have given them two teams. Wait. You did.
Any way … Your senior developers will suddenly look over and see someone a
decade younger pinning stickies to the wall. It works like a charm. Even the
crustiest hackers will crumble at this point. Doggedly they’ll announce “Just
show me what you want to get built, and I’ll build it!” BINGO! We’re shipping
****ing product.

### 23\. The Mystical Backlog / Roadmap

Be very mysterious about the product backlog. People shouldn’t be able to find
it, and you should always say things like “we don’t like to plan more than a
couple weeks out”. We all know you can’t trust adults to look at a list of
things and understand that they might change. Change that backlog and you’ll
have some seriously sad adults on your hands, who likely joined the company
for its reputation for incredibly boring and predictable work.

This also goes for the product roadmap. “Roadmap” is a funny word. Suddenly
the product team is a bunch of cartographers? Don’t be fooled, the “roadmap”
is basically an artifact of yearly planning cycles. Someone “upstairs” has
asked for a sense of what is going to get built. If you’re in the real world
your industry is changing monthly, not annually. With some tactical wins here
you’ll leave the team apathetic about anything that looks like a giant
swimlane gantt chart. Perfect. The long view encourages long-term thinking. We
hate that.

### Conclusion

And there you have it. Your PM training in one blog post. Repeat after me …

I can ship ****ing product

I can ship ****ing product

I can ship ****ing product

We can take our nebulous, difficult to define, context-specific profession
back. One set of dashed expectations at a time.

(P.S. … hopefully the satire was apparent :)


# 12 Core Competencies For Product Managers

Learn. Practice. Learn.

### 12 Core Competencies For Product Managers

#### Learn. Practice. Learn.

A college student asked me recently about product management and Product
Management “skills”. I thought for a bit and sent her this list. The key here
is that these skills can be learned and practiced. It isn’t magic. Other
things must be learned the hard way.

I haven’t listed things like Agile, scrum, roadmaps, backlogs, user-story
writing, etc. You can read a couple books and get the gist. Learning “Agile”
in one organization might not help you in your next job. Learning to
communicate clearly or facilitate a meeting effectively will serve you for
your whole career (in product management, or otherwise).

And with that, a list of 12 core competencies for Product Managers:

  1. Conduct [effective customer/user interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXXGvHafy0Y)
  2. Build [revenue](https://www.marsdd.com/mars-library/product-management-from-strategy-to-marketing-to-creating-a-business-model/), [pricing](http://pragmaticmarketing.com/resources/product-and-pricing-strategies), and adoption models. Micro/macroeconomics
  3. [Experiment design](http://liutaiomottola.com/myth/expdesig.html) and analysis. [Statistics](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461471370)
  4. Effective meeting [design and facilitation](http://hrweb.mit.edu/learning-development/learning-topics/meetings/articles/basics)
  5. Mapping and understanding complex competitive, partner, and customer ecosystems. [Complexity and systems thinking](http://www.resilience.org/stories/2014-06-18/systems-thinking-and-complexity-101). Domain research
  6. Basic [data modeling](http://www.agiledata.org/essays/dataModeling101.html), [JSON](http://www.w3schools.com/json/), XML, working knowledge of [relational and non-relational databases](http://www.jamesserra.com/archive/2015/08/relational-databases-vs-non-relational-databases/). [SQL](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/), [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) APIs, [processing data using Python](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-data-intro/), etc.
  7. Experience with various analytics tools, and business intelligence tools. Know what you’re looking for, and where to find it.
  8. Broad understanding of usability, usability testing, [usability heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). Ability to communicate to the user experience team using a [common language](https://pidoco.com/en/help/ux)
  9. Awareness of cognitive biases, and [how they impact decision making](http://lifehacker.com/this-graphic-explains-20-cognitive-biases-that-affect-y-1730901381).
  10. Communication skills: listening, verbal, writing, and visual communication
  11. [Effective note-taking](http://www.theopennotebook.com/2011/12/06/taking-good-notes/)
  12. [Time-management](http://pragmaticmarketing.com/resources/time-management-for-product-managers)

Any to add? Self-learning success stories?


# What Startup Sales Can Learn From UX

Startups, Sales, UX, and building a repeatable growth engine

* * *

### _What Startup Sales Can Learn From UX_

#### Startups, Sales, UX, and building a repeatable growth engine

As consumers and product users, we are perpetually purchasing “things” that
end up going unused. We blame ourselves for misunderstanding our own needs and
motivations, the product for not “working”, the salesperson for coercing us,
and the flashy (but misleading) ad. For whatever reason, things don’t work
out. Boxsets go unwatched, bikes go unridden, [high-tech car features go
untouched](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/survey-shows-many-high-
tech-car-features-go-unused), and personal finance software gathers virtual
dust.

This extends to much of the software we [use in our day-to-day
work](http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2013/11/applying-8020-rule-in-
software.html).

For some hot domains in the B2B SaaS software world — collaboration,
analytics, big-data, CRM, and marketing automation — the root problem is not a
tool problem. Tools, and countless variations, exist by the boatload. Rather,
the problem exists in our organizational cultures, structures, and roles, our
data-literacy, our ability to adapt to new ways of working, and our _innate
individuality_ when it comes to interacting with products in general. It’s
tough to be one-size-fits-all.

These are meaty problems that transcend domain. They [attract a lot of
entrepreneurial and investment
attention](https://index.co/top/market/saas/investments/2016), despite the
competitive landscape and low odds of success. Even when you understand those
root barriers to adoption (culture, skills, literacy), forging a repeatable
business model can be challenging. But most don’t get that far …

Beyond dealing with the competition, startups routinely drift into confusion
and cognitive bias. Founders confuse their own early sales efforts — selling
on vision and big picture — [with the day-to-day work of their
reps](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/10/12/startup-sales-why-hiring-
seasoned-reps-may-not-work/). We equate growth with demand and a large
available market. And assume our product “fits” because someone presses
Purchase Now or cuts a check.

Popular methodologies (e.g. Lean Startup) promote experimentation. But there’s
a big difference between testing with a squirt gun and a firehose. Lean
Startup stresses [structured and focused
experiments](http://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_promise_of_lean_experimentation),
but this rigor is often overlooked when the rubber hits the road and the team
fires up [Marketo](https://www.marketo.com/) and
[Salesforce](http://www.salesforce.com/).

Testing with a firehose can yield results (think growth and sales) but not the
learnings required to sustain that growth before running out of money or
imploding. This extends to being “customer-obsessed”.

We confuse our ability to sell to and support our customers with our ability
to repeatedly make someone happy with our product. Heroic efforts feel great,
but it is [damn difficult to make them repeatedly
great](https://hbr.org/2012/02/the-end-of-customer-service-he). It translates
to customer education — “our customers would absolutely fall in love with our
product if they knew how to use it”. And most nefariously to how we iterate on
and build our product — “if our customers pay us, then their requests are
valuable”.

The common theme here is a misunderstanding (either through lack of
experience, or founder goggles) of something user experience professionals
deal with every day. [No one person or company thinks, works, and adopts
software the same way](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3013474/).
Personas are far more rich and varied than we would like to believe. Product
complexity increases exponentially as the number of personas/goals/situations
increase. To solve someone’s problem, and validate that you’ve solved it, you
need to get [specific](http://www.instigatorblog.com/good-
hypotheses/2011/05/05/).

This is something that most of us understand intuitively — “no one person is
the same” — but its impact on product design and sales service design (sales
is a “service” if you think about it) is routinely underestimated. It’s the
opportunist in all of us. We’d like to believe that there is a homogenous
groundswell of interest in our product. So we turn on the sales firehose.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sie8DhRoJZulViTzUsXmBA.png)

Sales and UX have a lot in common. Both deal with psychology every day — sales
to [close the deal](http://www.businessinsider.com/daniel-pink-to-sell-is-
human-2013-1), and [UX to design the experience](https://uxmag.com/articles
/the-psychologists-view-of-ux-design). Sales understands that certain pains
are ubiquitous, and routinely exploits that to close a deal and connect that
to the story of your product. It’s necessary to try novel things and be
scrappy. New stories, incentives, and nudges move the needle in the short-
term. What we say we need, and what we actually need are two different things.
Sales and UX gets all of this.

Like users, sales teams optimize around what is “easiest” to sell, which may
not correlate with what is easiest to support, retain, and grow. Internally,
incentives reign supreme and — as any UX pro knows — it is difficult to
reroute the sales freight train once it is up to full speed. Once a sales team
gets moving it takes on a life of its own. Without [a
strategy](https://hbr.org/2015/12/dont-turn-your-sales-team-loose-
without-a-strategy), things can go a little haywire. Part and parcel to that
strategy is having a sense of the “who”.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*juOfh1pFqOVmICjLKHxkWg.png)

UX knows it is very difficult to design a product or service that pleases all
people, in all situations. People may look similar, and their pains may, in
fact, be similar, but their product needs are not similar. Sales sells to
common pains. UX designs for specific groupings of people and their pains.
When UX thinks about personas they consider (among other things) technical
savvy, experience with similar tools, experience in the domain,
psychographics, barriers to adoption, relationships, demographics, behavioral
traits, and organizational culture. Importantly, they design for a limited
“fingerprint” across these various
[dimensions](http://www.servicedesigntoolkit.org/assets2013/posters/EN/P3-persona%20dimensions-A1.pdf).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7Cv8zQGubobRAua4cpdxEQ.png)

<http://www.elezea.com/2013/09/case-study-vumi-go-redesign/>

For example, there is a big difference between someone who knows how to solve
the problem (with the right tool) and someone who aspirationally seeks a
solution. Both will buy the product and respond to pain selling. Building a
product for both requires different strategies. John, an executive in a low
growth industry working inside a stiff organizational culture will behave
differently from Mary, an exec working inside a nimble, tech-forward
organization in a high-growth sector. Both may be aware of the problem to
solve. They agree on that. But John’s work will need to withstand
organizational blockers, while Mary has to be scrappy and get the data she
needs to secure next year’s budget.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jYvKGLHWArEF46xdeajYrQ.png)

<http://www.bryaneisenberg.com/personas-magic-behind-mirror/>

Increasing sales does not mean you have a [repeatable sales
process](https://salesandmarketing.com/content/sales-playbooks-key-repeatable-
sales-process), or a repeatable path to growth. It doesn’t prove your product
actually delivers specific value. Proving this requires more rigor. You are
validating a “designed” sales process:

  * A specific user persona, buyer personas, and organizational persona
  * Your ability to locate, attract, and communicate with all three in a repeatable fashion
  * Understand the [varied needs of a specific set of users](https://articles.uie.com/multiple_personalities/)
  * [Structured and consistent messaging and marketing ](http://startupmanagement.org/2014/10/14/messaging-positioning-branding-for-startups-what-happens-after-productmarket-fit/)… a singular brand message
  * Similar touch points along the customer journey
  * A match with the product as it exists today. Not an imaginary future version of the product
  * Acquisition and retention costs (including ad-hoc feature development costs) … focusing on ongoing expectations. A startup can rapidly meet new customer requests. Will the customer be as enthusiastic as that growth slows?

The key here is specificity. Selling to everyone may make your quota, but it
diminishes learning.

UX deals with this often. When we research and design, we focus on specific
personas (or small set of personas). When we test our designs, we focus on
people AND situations that match those personas. We iterate on that
understanding constantly. And then we apply those learnings and patterns
elsewhere in the product. Through a variety of methods, UX Research seeks to
answer three questions — [what do people want, what do people need, and can
people use it](https://speakerdeck.com/tsharon/validating-assumptions-with-12
-ux-research-methods) — — through the lense of a specific person and situation

What are some specific examples?

Nothing new here, but UX (and marketing) develops AND validates [rich
personas](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/persona-s-non-grata-5587cb46409c).
Are these people who we think they are? Does their behavior match who we think
they are? We consider [psychographics, demographics, goals, motivations,
roadblocks, domain-specific characteristics, current
roadblocks](http://www.contentharmony.com/blog/bootstrapped-customer-persona-
validation/), etc. This is commonplace for big companies, but during the
startup phase we are constantly drilling down, iterating, and validating our
“persona hypothesis”. This is almost impossible if you’re taking a broad
approach. Sure, your sales and growth might be higher, but you’re not
learning.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yEolUvVRg8rQiKokLUQq5Q.png)

<http://www.garymagnone.com/blog/content-marketing-digital-touchpoints/>

This attention extends to the customer journey. How does the customer interact
with your company from first impressions — the ad online or mention at a
conference — to their first renewal as a happy company. UXers attempt to
understand these types of problems using [customer journey
maps](http://www.servicedesigntools.org/tools/8) and then by validating these
against actual customer behavior. Again, the more of these you now support,
the more assumptions you have in “inventory”. Sheer luck and persistence can
grow the business, but learning which journey actually produces that happy
renewal is paramount.

Finally, UX is constantly testing prototypes. We design low-cost experiments
(designs), test, and iterate. Before doubling down, we make sure the design is
going to work. This extends to pushing product live and measuring how people
actually use the product. Modern startup buzz-wordists have coined the term
[growth hacker,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking) and on many
levels UX and growth-hacking are remarkably similar: with common traits of
creativity, experimentation, prototyping, empathy, data and analysis.

I’m persuaded that the real value of freemium and self-serve free-trial models
is that they create a framework within which it is difficult to bias the
results. The models limit touch points and user journeys. We validate our
positioning, adoption, and renewal in a repeatable way that can be easily
adapted. Perhaps that’s the true value … freemium and self-service free trials
may not be “better” than more high touch sales, but they certainly have the
potential to be a lot less biased.

In closing …

  * View sales as a [service design concep](http://www.servicedesigntools.org/)t, and embrace those methods accordingly. On principle, you’ll start with specific personas which is the real message here. You’ll learn to understand the customer journey across your product — from first touch to renewal.
  * Choose learning over growth. [Learning starts with specific tests, not a firehose](http://steveblank.com/2015/05/06/build-measure-learn-throw-things-against-the-wall-and-see-if-they-work/). Learning transcends departments in your growing startup. Set learning goals, not sales goals. The sales model validation process cannot be run independently of product or retention experiments.
  * Embrace the value of the [lean canvas](https://leanstack.com/lean-canvas/) in all of its complexity. Don’t skimp on the market segmentation, cost model, and channel hypotheses. Testing more than one or two things at once is virtually impossible.
  * Attract a sales team that is open to iterating, learning, and rolling with changes in approach. Your best bet may be less experienced, but more flexible team members.


# I would agree.

* * *

I would agree. Wrong choice of words on my part. I think I was probably
thinking more of drivers and dependencies not “constraints” in the sense of
resource constraints. I’d agree that funneling more resources behind a lack of
focus can lead you even further astray (perhaps the hidden blessing of having
a small team). I think it was Johanna Rothman who said something like a
project with one driver and one major constraint can typically succeed. Two
drivers and two constraints can succeed but only with great luck and
oversight. And three driver efforts typically always fail.

### Decision Making Transparency (The Why)

> In the swirl of growth, it’s easy to confuse and conflate transparency on
the decision making process, with transparency on actual decisions and
details.

> The Why is scalable because it carries the original intent of our decision,
and not just the tactic.

Even in [radically transparent
environments](https://www.sequoiacap.com/grove/posts/bzgw/radical-
transparency) it can be difficult to consume all of the information peripheral
to your day to day work. There is simply not enough time in the day. And the
multi-tasking would kill you.

And then you have the information that is deemed too sensitive or distracting
to share. Where to draw the line is outside the scope of this post, but
suffice to say there are always pieces of information that are too sensitive
or risky to share broadly.

The reality is that our work lives are largely influenced by external factors.
Decisions driving team changes, promotions, strategic shifts, project choices,
and tool choices can have a dramatic impact on the lives of the various
stakeholders. In an ideal setting these decisions would all be “local”, but
that is rarely the case.

In the swirl of growth, it’s easy to confuse and conflate transparency on the
decision making process, with transparency on actual decisions and details.
The former is powerful and engaging. The latter is so frequent that it’s
impossible to keep up. But it is easy to conflate the two and assume that both
are impossible.

It’s not impossible. Communicating the decision framework starts with some
fundamental questions …

  * Who makes the decision? Who is impacted?
  * How is the decision currently made (factors, timing, process, etc.) ?
  * What are we attempting to maximize and minimize with our decision?
  * What is our path for continuous improvement with this decision making process?

The last two points are critical. We typically frame important decisions based
on hierarchy … with the “decider” holding the power (and responsibility), and
those impacted playing a receiving role. It is unidirectional.

Consider a different perspective …

Answering these questions takes work. But it scales remarkably well.

Those impacted by decisions are often the best to determine whether those
decisions were effective. Did we realize the desired effect? How can the
decision making process be improved in the future? This is the “Why” that
people most crave. The Why is scalable because it carries the original intent
of our decision, and not just the tactic.

When people advocate for transparency, what they typically care about is not
knowing every detail. We quickly realize that’s impossible. But rather they
care about understanding how and why the decisions are made, and how and why
they can participate in iterating on the actual solution.

We trust others to make decisions. And they trust us to make decisions.

And then we enter into a partnership to continuously improve on those
decisions.

It’s the combination — trust and collaboration — that turns the typical
hierarchal decision making model into a partnership. And that lets information
sharing scale.

### Time Management: Tips for Product Managers

Time management can make or break your career as a product manager. You are
never “done”. There’s always more to do than you can possibly fit into a 60hr
week. And the cult of the rockstar PM only exacerbates the situation.
Organizations are hesitant to split the role for fear of incurring
coordination costs or losing that single “wringable neck”. It’s a recipe for
burnout, and a big reason why people do their time in the PM ranks and then
leave for greener pastures.

<https://theconsultantlounge.com/2015/09/avoid-burnout-in-consulting/>

### Say No (Nicely)

It is very easy to get drawn into every single discussion, every single
decision, and every single detail. PMs exist smack dab in the cracks of the
organization. You** become** the information conduit, which is a blessing for
your short term career, but a curse in disguise. No mortal can tie up all the
loose ends, and you eventually end up pissing people off. So you’ll have to
learn how to say **No** to meetings, calls, and continuous shoulder taps
without being a jerk. Part of this is a mindset shift. Less savvy product
managers tend to relish playing the information filter. But that simply
doesn’t scale.

### Shorter Recurring Meetings

Most meetings run too long. Ad hoc meetings lack focus, and rarely need to
happen right away (and if they do, it’s usually a sign your organization lacks
the ability to prioritize.).

Your best bet is to timebox a handful of recurring meetings (weekly, bi-
weekly, perhaps) to deal with more “transactional” communication. A well run
20 minute meeting can trump a poorly run 2hr meeting. Use constraints to force
focus. Instead of answering every single request from Sales adhoc, just
schedule a 30m optional weekly touch base and Q&amp;A. They’ll thank you
eventually. This will leave more time for the open-ended / divergent
brainstorming meetings that yield great breakthroughs and a happier team.

### Organize Information (Quickly)

PMs spent an inordinate amount of time organizing and disseminating
information. Most associate product managers get squashed under the load.
Customer calls go undocumented, requests get lost, and meeting notes disappear
into the ether — which in turn leaves people wondering what you do all day. If
you fail in the central task of providing context to teams, you are
essentially useless.

The trick here is to leverage all available tools. Find a good transcription
service (I use [rev.com](https://www.rev.com/)). Record meetings. Use a tool
like Evernote which features OCR, full-text search, tagging, integrations, and
a solid API ([see this great video by Aaron Walter on “Connected
UX”](https://vimeo.com/89520398)). Put together an [information
radiator](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/information-radiator.html) on a
whiteboard. Most importantly, be disciplined and constantly iterate on how you
provide context to your team. If no one is paying attention, find a better
way.

### Work Less and Time-Block

Product managers frequently operate under continuous stress, continuous sleep
deprivation, and continuous work fatigue. This makes it difficult to be at the
top of your game. Somehow you always seem to let tasks fill the available
hours in the day. To combat this I suggest time-blocking (see the [Pomodoro
Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/)) and calling a “hard stop” at a
reasonable time each day. Look back on the last month of your work. Was all of
that work really necessary? What work benefited the team?

### High Leverage

What are your highest leverage activities as a product manager? Some examples:

  * Passing new data and context to your team is high leverage
  * Figuring out how to be optional and dispensable — not being the blocker
  * Being available to your team when they have questions
  * Sensing patterns, drawing together disparate sources of information
  * Untangling what stakeholders (including customers) say they want vs.what they really need

These are the things you should focus on. Going to a meeting where nothing
gets done every week is not high leverage. High leverage work doesn’t
necessarily need to be glamorous. A quick set of meeting notes summarizing a
brainstorming session can move mountains. So be honest with yourself about
what work actually moves the needle.

One of the highest leverage things you can do as a product manager is to
figure out a way to build less, but still drive value for your customers. That
takes time and it takes testing. It also takes a fair amount of relaxation and
creativity on your part (see above). But the rewards are great. You can save
the team weeks and weeks of work. And any time you can get some piece of
software out there into the hands of customers earlier rather later is a huge
deal. The highest leverage work gets straight to the crux of the problem …
making valuable software.

### Eat Lunch…

  * Eat lunch!
  * Use lunches for creative brainstorming with coworkers. Get outside. A change of scenery can often spark great ideas
  * Take breaks and exercise. You’ll be more effective when you are “on”
  * Know when you are at your best. Use that time for your highest leverage work.

Check out this classic HBR article: [Manage Your Energy Not Your
Time](https://hbr.org/2007/10/manage-your-energy-not-your-time)

### **In Closing**

None of this is rocket-science. But as PMs we frequently get caught up in the
day-to-day. Our work starts to feel 100% reactive. We lose, of course, but so
does our team. Worst of all, it begins to promulgate the PM stereotype:
overworked, narcissistic, controlling, untrusting, and fickle.

The goal isn’t to work 80hrs, but to discover those things that make everyone
— and especially your team — more effective. Then, everyone wins — you, your
team, your customer, and your business..


# Your Startup: Food Truck or Buffet?

Is your startup a Food Truck or a Buffet?

* * *

### Your Startup: Food Truck or Buffet?

Is your startup a Food Truck or a Buffet?

### Food Trucks

Food trucks live and die by trying to do one thing well, and they’re
relatively cheap to bootstrap ([$70,000 —
$80,000](http://www.forbes.com/sites/investopedia/2012/09/27/the-cost-of-
starting-a-food-truck/#440fea602930)). If your clientele dries up — the local
venture funded startup goes caput, for example — you can drive somewhere else.
It’s just you, your partner, your food, and your customers.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*1mV9tajvoGXrqxH1.)

<http://www.post-gazette.com/life/dining/2015/07/26/Food-trucks-have-nowhere-
to-go-but-up/stories/201507260052>

Food trucks let restaurateurs be creative and nimble. Writes Josh Ozersky in
[Why Food Trucks Aren’t Going Away](http://ideas.time.com/2012/06/13/food-
trucks-are-here-to-stay/):

> You see, it’s not just diners who have become more fickle, more demanding,
more impatient with the conventions of traditional restaurant food. It’s the
chefs too, who want to be flexible, to try out crazy mash-ups, stunts, and
culinary in-jokes

Of course food trucks [have their fair share of challenges](http://mobile-
cuisine.com/business/why-do-food-truck-businesses-fail/) like licensing,
undercapitalization, being myopic about your vision, the gold-rush mentality
(sound familiar, startups), and lack of identity. And they can fail like any
other business. [This article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/22/food-
truck-failures_n_2499463.html) cites failure rates around 30–35%.

### Buffets

People go to buffets to absolutely stuff their face. It’s [a
sport.](http://midtownlunch.com/2007/03/07/the-ml-guide-to-all-you-can-eat-
chinese-food-buffets/) It’s commodity eating. It’s almost sacrilegious (this
Saudi cleric went as far as to issue [a fatwa against all you can eat
buffets](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/15/buffet-ban-fatwa-saudi-
cleric_n_4971190.html)). The only thing “unique” about a particular buffet is
its sheer enormity and the spectacle.

[Good buffets aren’t cheap](http://casinofabs.com/Controlling-Buffet-
Costs.htm), with food costs in the 50–60% range and back of house costs much
higher than traditional restaurants. You can’t start a buffet in a van. You
need a cavernous kitchen, storage, ice for those massive bland Alaskan crab
legs, big pots, and lots of labor. And that’s why most buffets feature mostly
gut-filling, mediocre food.

Buffets are also [a food safety
nightmare](http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2010/07/buffets-and-cross-
contamination/#.VuZCBZMrKCQ) … even with the sneeze guards. Your Golden Corral
chili [might have a rat head](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national
/florida-man-claims-golden-corral-chili-rat-head-article-1.1981988) swimming
around in there if you aren’t careful (test first). It’s hard to keep track of
all that food, rotate it, heat and cool it, and throw it out when it festers.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*dbjrQsKORYkVPosj.)

### How About Your Startup?

Are you trying to be all things to all people, and suffer from quality issues?
Do large swaths of your product go uneaten? Can you pivot and change direction
easily? Is focus fleeting? Were you lured into the idea of offering a
“platform”, but turned around to find that the broad offering was more of a
collection of commodity-grade features?

If so, it might already be too late. Put on the brakes now. Figure out how you
can stay food-truck-like for longer. Iterate on your product, and then take
the step up to a “real” restaurant.


# How Much Does A New Feature Cost?

More Than You Think …

* * *

### How Much Does A New Feature Cost?

#### More Than You Think …

One of the fundamental challenges of product development is understanding the
true cost of releasing a new feature. The benefits feel concrete. Shipping
feels great. Talking costs is a downer.

Consider …

  1. Opportunity costs across all disciplines
  2. Cost to implement feature (engineering, UX, product)
  3. Cost to implement incremental improvements (engineering, UX, product)
  4. Cost to deliver feature (processing, storage, monitoring)
  5. Cost to train people internally to sell the feature
  6. Cost to train people internally to support the feature
  7. Cost to market the feature to existing customers
  8. Cost to market the feature to new customers
  9. Coordination costs across all teams
  10. Cost to document and train users/customers on new feature
  11. Cost to maintain that extra documentation
  12. Cost to train engineers on more complex codebase
  13. Cost of slower engineering, caused by increased system complexity and maintenance
  14. Cost to hire more resources to account for slower engineering
  15. Cost of reduced flexibility, caused by increased system complexity and maintenance
  16. Cost of maintaining system usability as system broadens
  17. … until the feature reaches end-of-life (unless you retire it)

It turns out that engineering costs are but a small part of the puzzle.

Wow. So I guess it isn’t just a week or two of work! The good news is that you
don’t need to cut a check for these things right away. The hard news is that
you’ll end up paying in the long run. And many features end up going unused
(or rarely used).

So … consider this expanded list of costs the next time you think about
tacking on a new feature. Is it still worth it?

# Stop Setting Up Product Roadmaps To Fail

Why Read

### Stop Setting Up Product Roadmaps To Fail

### Why Read

Stop debating whether you are doing product roadmaps “right”, or whether
roadmaps are evil. Look instead at the job you are hiring your roadmap to
achieve. And then ask if the roadmap is the best tool for the job.

### TOC

  * 14 common product roadmap problems
  * A summary of almost all methodology debates on Twitter
  * Roadmap Needs and Being Awesome

New to Product Management? What is a product roadmap? For a standard
definition see [here](http://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/product-roadmap).

* * *

### A Litany Of Roadmap Ills

Roadmaps are frequently abused. To save you thirty minutes, I’ve organized
these observed problems into the list below.

Some of these problems are inherent to the process — you need to actively work
to prevent them from happening. Others are caused by user error or deep
organizational dysfunction. And some are governed by even broader effects like
the planning fallacy, confirmation bias, and groupthink.

**Roadmaps encourage people to…**

  1. [Horse trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trading) initiatives, placate stakeholders vs. focusing on value creation
  2. Stick to the plan when the plan is no longer optimal
  3. Chase harmfully high utilization rates (the jigsaw illusion)
  4. [Future sell](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/694-you-dont-need-a-product-road-map), instead of relying on the current merits of product
  5. [Prioritize new feature development](https://blog.intercom.io/where-do-you-suck-where-does-it-matter/) (items which can be easily understood and sold) over equally promising enhancements to the existing product
  6. Converage prematurely on solutions
  7. Rely on estimates, despite the fallibility of those estimates

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lOyg3v-GPArdMfHFP558mA.png)

“Big Batch” Planning

**Roadmaps …**

  1. Encourage the illusion that efforts are linked to a timeline(when most aren’t)
  2. Obscure underlying assumptions, rationale, and vision. Even when described (e.g. a theme), it is still difficult to parse why the theme matters
  3. Institutionalize “big batch” yearly planning, which in turn decreases agility
  4. Encourage group think — [satisficing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing) — over focus. Initiatives lose their bite
  5. Fail to address the needs of all “users” (e.g. your roadmap is fine for communicating with executives, but fails to meet the needs of your front-line teams)
  6. Discourage experimentation and acting on new insights / data
  7. Create dependencies across the organization (decreases agility

**This Tweet from Jeff Patton wraps it all up:**

**Some common pitfalls I described in a recent talk:**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fD83hoX1EY5rVzT5ERx4dw.png)

### Challengers vs. Defenders

OK. That’s a pretty hairy list. I’m not the first to challenge roadmaps.
Luckily this stuff is out there in the google-verse by the boatload. You will
also find debates that look something like this:

**Challenger  
**[Methodology] is flawed

**Defender  
**You’re just not doing it right. The real value is in [Some Positive Aspect]. Yes, some people abuse these things. Just not me …  
You need to get back to the basics …  
You need to stop doing it the old way …

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eXUqdtEc2SMBg2H5xxCg4Q.png)

**Challenger  
**What could you do such that [Some positive aspect] would be possible without the abuse, and observable negative effects?

**Defender  
**This is heresy. Here in the real world we need [Methodology] because [Some Reason]. And plenty of great teams — you know [Company] — use them also. So you’re on crack!

**Challenger  
**What is to say that [Company] isn’t successful in spite of [Methodology] ?

**Defender  
**Damn you. I’m blocking you on Twitter.

Check out this overview of one of the classic Twitter debates (from a somewhat
similar question … #noestimates)

### If Things Were Awesome

To be clear, I advocate for thinking in terms of initiatives, problems to
solve, and missions. And that’s nothing new or groundbreaking. I use mind maps
like this:

This advice is mirrored by most of the roadmapping software vendors like
[ProductPlan](http://www.productplan.com/) and
[Aha](http://www.aha.io/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=brand_search&gclid
=CJKj-bHg88sCFYMehgodOFoMzw), as well as folks like [Melissa
Perri](https://medium.com/u/d5387b79efe8), [Roman
Pichler](https://medium.com/u/9562e5263e32), etc. All caution against using
the roadmap as a glorified feature gantt chart.

The other day, [Woody
Zuill](https://twitter.com/WoodyZuill?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)
asked me something to the effect of:

> what would need to happen such that this wasn’t even an issue. What would it
take for the company to be awesome?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*hPu3Zi5A1i1Ngos-.)

Let’s try that thought experiment …

What would a crazy successful and awesome product development team actually
look like? Would they still have gant-like visuals for their roadmap?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*MJyRcuIpGEG5pxgB.)

Probably not. The future might look nothing like a 12 lane LA highway. Because
you’d be on a bullet train.

### Needs &amp; Being Awesome

Continuing on that thought …

  * You’ve hired the roadmap because you have a **Need**
  * If things were **Awesome**, what would things look like?

**Need:** “The process helps us have the right conversations”  
**Awesome:** “We have the right conversations without needing a prop. It is [easy to get real](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UQYKVE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1), and discuss priorities without solutioning. We leverage the right decision making and focusing tools for the job, without bad side-effects.”

**Need:** “I need to know if you’re working on my favorite feature, or plan to”  
**Awesome:** “The product development team continuously surprises and delivers value. So much so that pet features become far less important. We maintain a low planning-inventory. All team members are encouraged to submit ideas to solve our most important challenges.”

**Need:** “We have to meet to decide which features are most important, to advocate for our ideas, and favorite features”  
**Awesome:** “The problem to solve is known, and all team members — down to the developers, UX, etc. — are empowered to solve them and try to push the needle without drowning in meetings. And we make continuous progress towards those goals. Everyone trusts each other. When we fail, that’s OK as well … provided we learn, and do better next time.”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PgeB1tI_4pjT0T23wFF-Hw.png)

**Need:** “We need to have a yearly plan, and the roadmap is part of that”  
**Awesome:** “You always have focus, vision, and direction … not just in late December (or whenever your yearly planning period is). Gaining that shared understanding is a rapid process, and can happen at any appropriate time. Few dependencies hamper the team. We respond immediately to new opportunities, and data.”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*f0IF-fzFXv4G8r_iz9lGsw.png)

**Need:** “We need to know what is coming down the pike!”  
**Awesome:** “The product is sellable, awesome, and valuable as is. You’d be able to sell to those people without pitching shaky future promises. You’d discuss features released in the last two months, and the prospect would be wowed. From a technology standpoint we can flexibly tackle new challenges without a ton of notice.”

**Need: **“We need to see the big picture, where are we going, and how our work fits into that”  
**Awesome:** “The evidence of impact is everywhere: in customer feedback, in the data, and in the dollars and cents. Teams link their work directly to a compelling vision (the big picture). Most importantly, the current work is impactful, so there is no need to future sell internally.”

Note: If you listen carefully, most “big picture” discussions are actually a
code for “we don’t think we’re making a difference”.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*2votZLbfcMxlPYKP.)

<http://www.boost.co.nz/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Release-Planning-PSI-
Program-Plan.png>

**Need**: “We need to coordinate with marketing, training, and support”  
**Awesome:** “A steady stream of awesome. Short lead times are acceptable to partners, and the batches are small enough to handle gracefully. Teams iterate on features until they “hit the mark” and then marketing uses that actual data (and case studies and momentum) to market. Training and support coexist with the development teams instead of “tossing it over the wall”.”

**Need:** “The board keeps asking us for our roadmap”  
**Awesome:** “The board knows what goals you are shooting for, and your progress towards those goals. Quarterly meetings involve real news, and real data, along with the sweeping vision (“we aim to take that hill, and that hill”). You’d exceed your goals, so no extra icing is necessary.”

* * *

No, no, no you’ll say. We need roadmaps to address these needs! But consider a
time when your team was just flowing, building awesome stuff, making customers
happy … was it because of your roadmap?

### Conclusion

Roadmaps aren’t the problem, obviously. We pick our tools and methods. My goal
with this post was to encourage you to challenge the “why”: why use roadmaps,
why use roadmaps the way we typically use roadmaps, and what it might take to
be awesome (such that this conversation is irrelevant).

Consider many of the enduring debates: estimates, roadmaps, technical debt,
iteration length, team structure, roles, Agile …

Why do we continue arguing about them? Perhaps because they — and the
methodologies we create to control them — are symptoms and medicine for those
symptoms. Dig deeper!

> _The economic problem of (an organization) is rapid adaptation to changes in
its particular circumstances. Then, the ultimate decisions must be left to the
people who are familiar with these circumstances, who know directly of the
relevant changes and of the resources available to meet them. This problem
cannot be solved by first communicating all this knowledge to a central board
which then issues its orders. But the “man on the spot” cannot decide solely
on the basis of his limited but intimate knowledge of his immediate
surroundings . There still remains the problem of communicating to him
suchfurther information as he needs to fit his decisions into the whole
pattern of changes of the larger ( organizational) system

# Opening Your Eyes to Real Customer Delight

Drawings by Claire Bowman

### Opening Your Eyes to Real Customer Delight

Drawings by [Claire Bowman](https://about.me/ClairesOddities)

#### How delighted customers behave, and why measuring and learning from these
signals is likely one of the most important things you can do for your product

* * *

### Yes … Delight

Rewind to a time before, [as Kevin Roose writes in New York
Magazine](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/08/silicon-valley-whimsy-
is-trumping-usefulness.html), “the titans of tech start[ed] talking like
kindergarten teachers.” Delight meant [a high degree of
satisfaction](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/delight) … the 10 on a
1–10 custom satisfaction survey._ _Fast-forward and it has come to represent
all that is wrong with gratuitous design-for-design’s-sake, startup founder-
speak/gibberish, and hokey marketing campaigns.

Jared Spool beautifully describes the difference in[ this story about Hyatt
Hotels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewpz2gR_oJQ&feature=youtu.be&t=58) and
their “random acts of kindness” campaign:

> The problem at the time, and the reason their customer satisfaction was
going down, was that they had a lot of frustraters to combat. They were
getting a large number of complaints. Instead of addressing those problems
they decided to go for _delight_ and focus on delighting people. [They
thought] hopefully you can use _delight_ to cover the bad smell of the failing
hotel

That’s not the brand of delight I’m talking about in this post. I’d like to
resurrect the classic, more general definition … because _delighted_ means
extremely satisfied or pleased. And this post is about what customers do when
they are extremely satisfied or pleased.

Plus _delight_ is 10 characters less than _extremely satisfied_. Onward …

### The Product/Market Fitting Room

Start-ups constantly struggle with defining (and finding) [product/market
fit](http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee204/ProductMarketFit.html). They plumb
product metrics hoping to “prove” engagement and [predict
renewals](http://www.predictiveanalyticstoday.com/customer-churn-renew-upsell-
cross-sell-software-tools/). From a strict dollars-and-cents standpoint,
selling product and renewing customers is the goal. But, in most domains (and
especially B2B SaaS), neither really indicates whether the customer is truly
delighted with their purchase.

Many businesses make the mistake of assuming that a customer is loyal, simply
because they aren’t complaining and they keep coming back month after month. -  
 [Wootric](http://blog.wootric.com/what-happens-when-you-confuse-repeat-
business-with-customer-loyalty/), “What Happens When You Confuse Repeat
Business with Customer Loyalty”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dVuCPvjKt_b8iv9ny-k59A.png)

Users with a “meh” attitude toward the product often stick around — sometimes
because they don’t have the time or energy to shop around, sometimes because
they’re too embarrassed to admit to themselves that they purchased the wrong
tool, and sometimes because someone [is forcing them to use the
software](http://chrislema.com/customers-and-users/).

### From “Meh” to “No, Thanks”

The trouble is that this customer indifference comes back to haunt you. That
captive user leaves their company and becomes a buyer elsewhere. As your
company grows, your time to sweet-talk individual customers into sticking
around is reduced.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0sYmIpXMUDBTavSR2W7Hcw.png)

You start rationalizing by thinking that usability and delighting customers
aren’t important in your domain, and that you’ll be fine as long as the
economics look promising. Maybe you cobble together some white papers and
share the occasional success story. Or, you fetishize using customer support,
customer success, and [services](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/consulting-
organizations-vs-product-shanif-dhanani) to patch up holes in your product.
Mediocre becomes the new normal.

This all takes a toll: your team eventually becomes disengaged. The product
rots from the inside out. Turning back the clock and regaining your edge is a
daunting task. You either start and stay there, or fight an uphill battle to
find your lost (or maybe never explored) product mojo.

There is a way around this, but it requires stubbornness and bullheadedness:
Demand to see evidence of real customer delight minus the Kool-Aid.

### “Measure” and Observe Delight

I’m going to go out on a very un-data-nerd-like limb here. To truly delight
your customers and create an amazing, differentiated product (and to do so
consistently year after year), you’ll need to measure things a bit
differently. I say this as someone who spends a great deal of time worrying
about how to measure things and how to use descriptive, predictive, and
prescriptive analytics to improve my product.

I’d argue that many of the product metrics we capture (e.g. engagement,
conversions) are proxies for less tangible things like customer delight,
advocacy, and product focus. The hard metrics can be used to predict churn and
trial conversions, but they fail to cut at the central question: Is our
product truly inspiring our customers and kicking ass? And, if so, why? Are we
[In-N-Out Burger, or
McDonalds](http://blogs.wsj.com/independentstreet/2009/01/28/in-n-out-burger-
vs-mcdonalds-guess-who-won/)?

Consider an example: a not-too-impressed diner leaves a 15% tip. A drunk diner
leaves a 20% tip. A thoroughly impressed and new fan-for-life diner leaves a
20% tip. All give the restaurant four stars in their online reviews. How do
you differentiate rabid foodie fandom from “a decent meal” or a happy buzz?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*aRYzLsa4dr0UWWuaofEiZA.png)

Not-Too-Impressed, Drunk, or Fan?

You can do a sentiment analysis of the review. Factor in the tip. Record
[facial biometrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4pM7j2ejDE). Have the
server assess the diner satisfaction. Measure length of the dining experience.

It is all “data,” albeit largely qualitative. The human computer is a pretty
good pattern matcher and sensor (despite our various biases, or maybe because
of them). [We lost at Go vs. Google](http://www.wired.com/2016/01/in-a-huge-
breakthrough-googles-ai-beats-a-top-player-at-the-game-of-go/), but we are not
half-bad at detecting rampant excitement. If it was all down to a perfect
science, though, we’d consistently make great products, predict all trends,
convert all customers, and never have product fails.

### Why Measure/Look For Delight?

When we open our eyes to what customer delight looks and feels like, we get
the right signals to tune our product strategy. By _product_ here I’m talking
about the the whole package: who you target, how you make customers successful
([customer success](https://medium.com/the-growth-hackers-cookbook/customer-
success-has-a-quantifiable-impact-on-revenue-d18d25786863#.pkfvsojf0)), the
goals and outcomes your software supports, your support team, and your sales
team. From the service design perspective, every interaction you have with
customers is “the product.” The customer experience extends far beyond logging
into a tool each day.

The key is awareness and not rationalizing a tepid response. When you have
that awareness of what a happy customer truly looks like, the rest becomes
“easy” (but still damn hard). For the builders it becomes more fun and
rewarding. And that has to count for something.

### The Delighted Customer

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PcESXNMaoVAdbL9Zi-CDig.png)

So, what do you keep your eyes open for? Take a big step back from your
dashboards, spreadsheets, and predictive algorithms and ask if your
users/customers are truly delighted. Are they obsessed with your product? Do
they self-identify with your mission? Are they your sales team, marketing
department, and product idea box all wrapped into one? And not just one
customer, or the occasional success story, but a good swath of your customers?

It is easy to pretend this stuff is happening. Or rationalize that it doesn’t
matter. But when it **_really_** happens, it’s a awesome thing. If you pay
attention, you may notice that the delighted customer…

### 1\. Really Likes You

  * Bakes the team a cake. (This is not a joke — I’ve seen it happen!)
  * Visits you when they’re in town. Invites you out for drinks.
  * Remembers your name! And the names of your team members.
  * Bugs you for T-shirts. And then sends you a photo of them wearing the T-shirt.
  * Uses emoticons when writing otherwise dry emails. Like …

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Df9N3VV59T2oZ5tr.)

### 2\. While in the Buying Process…

  * Seeks you out prior to purchase! Is delighted by what they imagine they can do with your product. Your marketing just gets them more excited. On that first call, is bubbling with ideas and questions before you even get started.
  * Shows hints of delight right from the start. Dives into a trial and take things further than you ever expected. On some level you feel like the roles have been reversed, and they’re selling to you!
  * Already knows how you compare to the competition — they’ve done their homework.
  * Can describe the precise pain they hope to address, or goal they hope to achieve, and connect that to unique product traits.
  * Makes the internal renewal case for you and spearheads the discussion with purchasing
  * Contacts you to renew, instead of waiting for your call. Contacts you to explore purchasing add-ons, instead of waiting for your email.
  * A couple of months after purchasing, writes to thank you. Literally, as in a handwritten thank-you note.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Tpt3kNmVtnLgJaGPdrE5tg.png)

### 3\. While Using the Product…

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xpOiMRZQ3VsjJDD5TNze1Q.png)

  * Describes your product as “very easy to use,” ”easy to learn,” ”user-friendly.” Cliche, yes, but NPS and SUS (system usability score) [are related](http://www.measuringu.com/blog/nps-sus.php) (more on this [here](http://www.measuringu.com/usability-loyalty.php)). This you can measure quantitatively.
  * Uses your product/company name as a verb: “We ______ed it.”
  * Writes you unsolicited emails with feature/product _ideas_** (**not feature requests, or fixes for workarounds).
  * Sends you feedback on new features shortly after they are released, again, without prompting.
  * Invests money to integrate with your product. Many customers may ask for pre-built “connectors,” but the most passionate customers will find it worth it to shoulder the cost of integrating.
  * Does awesome and unexpected things with your product (things you never expected or planned for).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WYSLJt_g_09NFxNS6TMJcA.png)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2fDb_zKh6prl08Yekn9O9Q.png)

  * Hounds you to learn about the roadmap, not because they’re waiting on features, but rather because they want to plan their training and get the most out of new functionality.
  * Regularly seeks the help of your support team to resolve _their _challenges rather than challenges with your product. The difference is critical.

### 4\. For Things They Value…

  * Writes or calls you to describe wins and provide proof (qualitative and quantitative data).
  * Describes how your product is actually changing the way they work and explains how.
  * Credits you for making their _personal_** **job easier and more effective. Or better yet, for helping them get a raise!
  * Proposes interesting partnerships if your products share a similar domain.
  * Creates their own training material around your product — not because your help docs aren’t comprehensive, but because they’re morphing their company around your product.

### 5\. As an Advocate…

See this post [for more about the value of brand advocacy](https://medium.com
/the-growth-hackers-cookbook/customer-success-has-a-quantifiable-impact-on-
revenue-d18d25786863#.s6sz9843l).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*s2nWKWNfDt5Y1_DcDVMAEA.png)

  * Hounds you to be part of a beta group or research panel.
  * Refers you to friends and professional contacts in their industry.
  * Uses _because_ when describing why they love your product: “I love ____ because.” Your best customer advocate is someone who can explain why the product benefits them.
  * Brings you with them to their next job, or at least tries.
  * Sends you unsolicited ideas for white papers and case studies. Volunteers because they want to be associated with the product. Provides you a reference logo for your website without prompting.
  * Interact with you across all available channels (blog post comments, forums, etc.).
  * Without coercion, recommends your product on sites like Quora, Stack Overflow, etc., and includes a detailed explanation of the “why.”
  * Hounds you about having a user conference, and maybe even offers to host one.
  * Promotes your product across their organization. Suddenly you get calls from people you’ve never met and they are already sold on the product because “_______ has been singing your praises.”

### Conclusion

This is not an argument against being data-driven. Rather, it’s an argument
for widening the _information gathering net_. I speak with many product teams.
They describe the glory days of being able to talk to each customer, to fill
their backlog with valuable items, and to ship software effortlessly. But now
“things are complicated”, budgets are tighter, and there’s a pressure to show
the ROI for product development efforts. Sure, build your analytics chops. Use
whatever data — quantitative and qualitative — you can find. Predict,
prescribe, and describe.

But don’t forget what got you here in the first place: happy, engaged, and yes
_delighted _customers. Because in most cases the metrics will bring you back
there anyway. Lay off the Koolaid and start listening.

### 10 Common PM Intuition Traps

Many situations in product development run counter to our intuitions. The
nature of the work is constantly changing. Context morphs frequently. Our
teams, organizations, competitors, and industries represent a dizzyingly
complex system. What we think works, makes sense and feels efficient betrays
us.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fOjsHl5gqack0hVGdb-hAQ.png)

The famous Katama weather rock …

Awareness helps. But so does habitually putting yourself in mildly
uncomfortable situations. The quest for consistency and repeatability is often
our Achilles’s heel and serves as a blocker to growth.

Below I’ve listed ten common intuition traps in product development. What
resonates? Disagree? Let’s have a conversation.

**1 Stop trying to keep your team “busy”**. Chasing high utilization is a recipe for catastrophic collapse. Encounter one unexpected setback, and the whole system crumbles. Instead, build in a safe level of slack to absorb the ebbs, flows, and hiccups. The snakes are invisible in knowledge work:

Watch out for the waiting snakes …

**2\. Stop managing large planning inventories**. Your goal is to invest time at the last responsible moment. What use is talking about something you’ll work on two months from now? The context will likely change, and that time spent planning will go wasted.

**3\. Stop attempting to “get ahead” of projects in small groups**, without the whole team present. It rarely has the desired effect. End what you’ve been working on, pause, breath, and then tackle the next mission together. Build shared understanding collaboratively with the team. A well-oiled team can ramp up on [a new challenge in a couple of days](http://www.gv.com/sprint/).

> [](https://twitter.com/AlexStearnCom/status/718619798775705600)

**4\. Stop believing estimates can help you plan**. It’s easy to play three-dimensional chess with your initiatives: “If A will take a long time, then it is better to do C and D!” The reasoning is sound, but it rarely pans out. Often, you’ve failed to slice out the parts of A that will be truly valuable. Or, more commonly, this suggests a deeper issue with priorities.

**5\. Stop multitasking!** Doing three things at once prevents the team from delivering value early, and rarely beats working serially.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xsUvG_nXqd4MQzd0pygboA.png)

<http://www.slideshare.net/JelenaFiodorova/teamwork-agile-way>

**6\. Stop saying “we might as well while we’re at it.”** It is tempting to tackle less valuable work because it is convenient. If the team happens to be in that area of the code, we pile on the requests. Pause and ask what is stopping you from tackling your most valuable opportunity.

**7\. Stop finishing for the sake of finishing.** If you’ve discovered your current effort will fail to drive value — especially considering the high costs of maintaining features — then just walk away. The [sunk-cost bias](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/how-the-sunk-cost-fallacy-makes-you-act-stupid.html) is incredibly powerful.

**8\. Stop grouping work into large batches**. Yes, they feel more comfortable and efficient because batches tend to incur a transaction cost. Think instead how you can [lower the costs associated with delivering small batche](http://dev2ops.org/2012/03/devops-lessons-from-lean-small-batches-improve-flow/)s (test automation, investing in DevOps, writing release notes, feature toggles, etc.) Large epics take on a life of their own and expand to fill the available space.

**9\. Stop forcing premature alignment/convergence**. Creativity and diversity drive novelty, passion, and innovation. Pressuring the team to “be on the same page” can thwart the journey towards discovering the right page!

**10\. Stop trying to solve problems with process alone**. It is tempting to believe that you can fix things with a slightly better process, tool, structure, or report. Or that things will transpire exactly how they’ve played out in the past. That’s rarely the case. It can be difficult to predict what will work in a rapidly changing environment. The alternate is to try what Dave Snowden calls “safe to fail probes”.

> Safe-fail Probes are small-scale experiments that approach issues from
different angles, in small and safe-to-fail ways, the intent of which is to
approach issues in small, contained ways to allow emergent possibilities to
become more visible. The emphasis, then, is not on ensuring success or
avoiding failure, but in allowing ideas that are not useful to fail in small,
contained and tolerable ways. The ideas that do produce observable benefits
can then be adopted and amplified when the complex system has shown the
appropriate response to its stimulus.

This point is made hilariously clear in Snowden’s advice for planning a
children’s party …

### Product! Stop Whining About Sales!

As Product folks, we need to stop whining about Sales. We aren’t the victim.
We need to break out of the “glass case of emotion”:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*J-xVDMEDgVgYKF3HOrkrWg.png)

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fmHCNfowbQ>

It’s our fault …

It’s our responsibility to shape a product that is easy to sell, easy to use,
enables excellent outcomes for our customers, AND has a winning growth model.
If that doesn’t exist, it is perfectly reasonable to expect our team — the
broader team, including sales — to “[flow like
water](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/29138-be-like-water-making-its-way-
through-cracks-do-not)” and take the path of least resistance. If that path
doesn’t lead to the product as it exists today, then the path is broken, not
the people.

Selling to the “right” people should be 100% natural: great customer
experience resonates with the “right” people, referrals happen, case studies
materialize, personas start to dot the wall and everyone zeros in on the sweet
spot.

Selling “in the box” should be 100% natural because the box addresses a
compelling pain point, even if it’s rough around the edges. And when it comes
time to renew, the “right” product (and team, and service delivery approach)
will renew itself without roadmap promises.

When that doesn’t happen, the organization becomes imbalanced and odd
incentives percolate. Consider how you’d react in the same situation with a
quota hanging over your head. You’d lodge yourself in the biggest and
gnarliest deal you could find to [slay the
elephant](http://andymonfried.blogspot.com/2006/02/elephant-hunting-in-sales-
term.html). Or churn out sub-optimal deals. We humans are pretty darn scrappy.

It’s your job as product person to point the way and make the case. If you are
still in learning mode, then make that clear!

The product can be easy to sell, but hard to use ([Brita water
filters](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-bad-to-never-change-a-Brita-filter)). Or
insanely valuable, but difficult to get into the hands of the right customer,
and turn into a successful business ([insert 50% of cool IoT Kickstarter
projects](http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/10/the-ugly-afterlife-of-
crowdfunding-projects-that-never-ship-and-never-end/)). Step back for a moment
and consider everything your company does as The Product. Your support is The
Product. The way your salespeople interact with customers is The Product. Your
marketing is The Product. The product “works” when all aspects of the service
— yes, probably best described [as a
service](http://thisisservicedesignthinking.com/), not a widget — are in
harmony.

The challenge of getting this right was my primary motivation for [joining an
analytics company](http://www.pendo.io/) focused on product teams. Consider
the problem. Cold hard cash, or a contract, has a way of trumping murky,
disparate, and difficult to extract data. That impending deal feels real. It
feels actionable. But we all know the slippery slope that can take us down.

There’s a reason why the product team is (often) viewed as the whipping boy of
the organization. We talk a big game but rarely have the data and evidence to
back up our gut. We try to care for the big picture but have trouble painting
the big picture. Or we lead by fiat, and erode trust.

But there’s an alternative. Easy to extract, easy to present, and easy to act
on evidence trumps all. Yes, this requires a cultural shift. But that’s part
of why you signed up.

So with that, stop whining and take responsibility for your product! Discover
a lucrative sweet spot and build something that exploits that information. Use
evidence (qualitative and quantitative) to tell a compelling story. And, show
empathy to your sales team!


# The Killer Sales Instinct vs. Startup Validation

As a rickshaw driver in NYC, I had my sales routine down pat.

### The Killer Sales Instinct vs. Startup Validation

As a rickshaw driver in NYC, I had my sales routine down pat.

Midwestern Couple in Times Square … “you folks like to take a tour of
Broadway? And then Central Park?”

Business Person, Park Ave, at 5 PM … “no cabs around, can I get you to Grand
Central for $20? 5 minutes!”

Lower East Side … “um, you know, hey, you guys need a ride to the Save The
Robots.”

When I picked up Ben Stiller and Dennis Rodman one night, I knew to ride
instantly AWAY from the paparazzi. I learned this through lots of trial and
error, undercharging, and losing my voice. It took months, but I got to the
point where I could come home with a couple of hundred bucks on any day of the
week.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3U5OC0De1KImLyOrbIK9VQ.png)

Manhattan Rickshaw Driver

I also learned that killer instinct. Not everyone had a great ride in the
rickshaw. But I knew how to get them to take the plunge and agree to $30 for
10 minutes of watching a scrawny kid pedal them three blocks. That felt
shitty. Especially when it was raining. But I needed to pay rent.

We are persuaded all the time to buy things we don’t need or use. Someone
wins. We lose. But with services — and I regard most software as a “service”
these days — you typically can’t succeed that way. You rely on someone coming
back. Unfortunately, so many of our methodologies are stuck in the “old” ways
of physical and shippable products … front-loaded to trigger the purchase
decision vs. the retain decision.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Ze1YzC_R2lNRDilASZJ1aQ.png)

A billboard from Croatia. He is actually offering truffles to the goddess. Go
figure.

The job of Product Development and Marketing becomes exponentially more
challenging when you cater to different personas. It isn’t linear. Three is
way more difficult than one. Every meeting becomes more difficult. Every UX
decision becomes more difficult. Every prioritization meeting becomes more
difficult. Every support case becomes more difficult. You just slow down.
There’s no way around it, and even late nights will not stem the tide.

With marketing, it is no easier. You can’t market to Classical Music fans and
Nascar Fans at the same time, even if they both need to go on a diet. The
approach will be different. Everyone wants to lose weight (the pain sells
decently well), but Bach aficionados and Kevin Harvick junkies are a different
breed. In both cases, the miracle diet goes unreturned, despite the 30 day
refund.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rrT066h8-v6frEUfvt8XYw.png)

**Selling to learn, and selling to sell is a fundamentally different task**. The minute that killer instinct bubbles up — that competitive drive to close the deal, that paranoia about the deal falling through, that fear of hitting the number — you’ve already lost your ability to learn about certain things. You’ll learn how to morph the message to the audience (like I did countless times as a rickshaw driver), but you won’t learn about the big picture.

Always Be Closing

> Get them to sign on the line that is dotted.

This is not a fundamentally bad thing. Some of us never learn how to turn that
drive on. It’s just a matter of timing. The time WILL come, but the time is
not now. That killer instinct is both an asset and liability.

The “learning” that needs to happen is: can you target someone with marketing,
pitch them, close them, get them to use your product, and make them insanely
happy as a customer? And do that repeatedly without insane heroism, and a
limited resource (like a psyched founder)? It’s something the [growth hacker
](https://growthhackers.com/)movement has figured out.

Your goal as a startup is to figure out your formula, not to grow immediately,
and not to hit numbers at all costs. It is a learning process. Most assume
that by setting goals and quotas they can tease that learning out. The problem
is that most people are wired to swim at all costs and not drown. It’s human
nature.

So, in closing, show your sales friends some empathy. Engage them in the
process of learning and incentivize them to learn. To reduce them to
simplistic bloodhounds — smelling blood, and chasing down deals at all costs —
is a disservice.

  * Pick a buyer persona and stick with that group. Run the test!
  * Test one or two techniques simultaneously (scripts, marketing, on-boarding, etc.)
  * Be willing to walk away
  * Stop fetishizing sales heroics. Fetishize learning heroics!
  * Form shared understanding around a typical journey map that spans teams


# 100 Product Development Hats

Stop thinking about titles in product development. Start thinking about Hats.
Why? Because it takes 100+ Hats to build an awesome product.

### 100 Product Development Hats

Stop thinking about titles in product development. Start thinking about Hats.
Why? Because it takes 100+ Hats to build an awesome product.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7pCG2R6cOLWYDGR_LAiCKQ.png)

Too often we focus solely on accountability, alignment, and efficiency. This
fixation frequently manifests in silos, politics, title obsession, and
hierarchies. Instead of focusing on what we need to build an awesome product—
safety, trust, and a diversity of viewpoints and skill-sets — we sub-optimize
to preserve the neat and tidy boxes. The turf-war benefits no one. And neither
does creating a shadow market of skills where people are not acknowledged and
recognized for the work they _really_ do.

**So what do _you_ need? What does your _product_ need? What do your _teams_ need? **Talk over these needs and hats with your team. Be flexible. Let people do what they’re good at, or want to learn more about. It will be “messy”, but the neat and tidy just results in crappy product.


# Go Towards The Discomfort (It’s A Sign)

… and stop doing things that make sense

### Go Towards The Discomfort (It’s A Sign)

#### … and stop doing things that make sense

_Illustrations by _[_Claire Bowman_](http://claire-bowman.squarespace.com/)_.
Editing help from Kate Maurer._

I woke up yesterday, but felt like I hadn’t slept. A bunch of leftover work
week worries bubbled up, stirred up by some good ol’ [imposter
syndrome](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/your-money/learning-to-deal-with-
the-impostor-syndrome.html?_r=0) (preparing for conferences will do that).
Notifications buzzed from my phone in the other room. Sun dripped through the
blinds — it was going to be a nice day. Then there was that moment of tension:

_Do I get out of my head, go out, see friends, and enjoy the weather (which I
know is 100% effective at making me feel better), or do I withdraw and spend
the day working and mulling over my angst?_

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jUfZDveIlz7VakyS4Vlvwg.jpeg)

I often opt for the latter, with reliably poor results. Weird, right?

You’ve felt that before. Maybe not with work angst, but with _something_:
picking the healthy food option, choosing to exercise after a long day at
work, giving someone a second chance, checking to see if the stranger on the
street is OK, or listening when you want to talk. Sometimes it is a simple
case of short-term benefit versus long-term gain. At other times these small
decisions cut straight to our fears, self-perception, and self-doubt.

Part of the brain is saying “You know the right thing to do! Push through!
Take a risk!” But there’s that other voice saying “That’s hard! Keep the
status quo! Make it go away! Time for dessert!” Should we do something that
feels unnatural, dangerous, impractical, uncomfortable, worrying, challenging?
Or do we just roll with it?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nXcVN_iE3NABLBbTzS1L9g.png)

That uncomfortable moment is a sign. It’s a **beacon**.

We experience these small decision points every day — as individuals, in
relationships and families, and as organizations and communities. But if we
opt for one path repeatedly, the beacon fades to a faint blip, and our neural
connections harden and stiffen. When that happens, we turn on the autopilot
(also known [System 1 thinking](http://bigthink.com/delancey-place/the-two-
systems-of-cognitive-processes), or the aptly named [lizard
brain](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/01/quieting-the-lizard-
brain.html)). In this mode, we act without thinking, and generally let our
fears rule us.

Until that happens, we have a chance, because we sense that moment of tension.
And that moment is an opportunity. Those small decisions add up.

What applies on the individual level also applies to how we work together in
communities and organizations. The road to organizational dysfunction is paved
with many common-sense, split-second, well-meaning, and very human decisions.

If you ask most people what they value in a work situation they will describe
things like autonomy, diversity, open communication, challenge, honesty,
coherence, a sense of purpose, and acknowledgment. Even more fundamentally, we
require safety, trust, and respect.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2LhW2K7CtvUXZB5LV3CJdg.png)

Contact me for a higher res version. This is a work in progress.

We set out with the best intentions, but go astray. Our many “common-sense”
decisions result in outcomes that run counter to our values, and over time a
stark incongruence settles like a fog. How often do we compromise on quality,
or humanity, or diversity, or trust, or transparency? Often. And that is when
things slip.

Some of these choices are automatic, and there’s no time to pluck the signal
from the noise. But, in most cases, there’s that glowing beacon — that split
second of tension and resistance — that indicates a better path is possible.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Ym91rCVYUMa1e9yb21Hqlg.jpeg)

You’ll often know these moments just by the words you use. Do any of these
snippets sound familiar?

> You’ll have to do that, because, well…**just because**.

> Perhaps **we shouldn’t share** that information. It might anger people.

> Let’s **be practical**. There’s **no way** that will work here.

> **How can we say no** at this point? We’re in too deep!

> Well, **it’s human** to just be worried about your own quota.

> We **can let it slip just this one time**. No one will notice.

You and your coworker probably know that you should **NOT** talk about someone
behind their back. You know you **SHOULD** include them and get real, but
habit kicks in. And there’s the challenge.

It’s human to buckle, and it’s human to take uncomfortable risks. It’s also
human to delude yourself, but also human — and possible — to [get to yes with
yourself](http://www.williamury.com/books/getting-to-yes-with-yourself/). We
are simultaneously creatures of habit and creatures of insight.

Which is awesome, if you think about it. We’re not doomed to repeat our
mistakes and send our organizations into an ugly spiral. The trick is to sense
those moments — the spark, instability, tension, momentary fear — and go
toward the discomfort. Adopt the beginner’s brain, and let that be your guide.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6rr4zgvFyLPTs0VYe8XRxQ.jpeg)

We can sniff out these opportunities because they have many common traits. You
can help your teams learn to be aware of them. To hone their radar — not for a
particular solution, not for “the way,” but for an opportunity.

At the core here we have a very human challenge, compounded by having LOTS of
humans in the picture. One response is to call the steady slide some variant
of the human condition, throw your hands up, and resign yourself to a steady
[drift into failure](https://www.govloop.com/community/blog/how-organizations-
fail-part-two-drifting-into-failure/).

Another perspective — the one I’ve been taking lately — is that every decision
is an opportunity: in our personal lives, in our work lives, and at the
intersection of the two. We can turn to face the discomfort and move forward,
or we can keep the status quo. In the process, we’ll mess up — that’s life.
But it’s the meditative practice of sensing these moments of tension,
acknowledging the path of habit and inertia, and taking the uncomfortable
route that counts.

How can we, as individuals, be clear with ourselves, and then bring that to
our organizations? It starts with emotional safety, and in the end requires
facing our discomfort. But it is possible.

What is **The Product?** What is **_Your_ Product?**

Your **Product** is …

  * Every prospect/customer interaction and touchpoint
  * Every interface, application, bit, byte, atom, and circuit
  * The collective learning of your organization
  * Your ads, brand communication, press, and social media presence
  * Your content, the words you use, the emotions you evoke
  * Your sales methodology, emails, calls, and visits
  * Your help documentation, customer support, and webinars
  * Your post-sales/onboarding experience. Your billing department
  * How you treat the customers you lose, and the prospects that say no
  * Your code quality, data-centers, infrastructure, and test coverage
  * The worst behavior you tolerate on the part of your leadership and team

Product is not something you “ship”. Increasingly, it is a service that the
whole organization _delivers continuously. _Tossing things over the wall isn’t
going to cut it. Dividing up your organization will restrict the flow of
valuable information. Aligning yourself around anything other than the end-to-
end customer experience is a form of sub-optimization. Any poor user
experience — using the software, on the phone with support, learning, buying,
or renewing — can sink you.

So when folks go on and on about defining product management … ask why? The
product is everything. Don’t let the anchor of old ways of delivering physical
software products weigh you down. You’re in the [service delivery and
design](http://www.servicedesigntools.org/) business now. Embrace it!

### What Does “Sales-Driven” Even Mean?

I frequently use the term “sales-driven” and contrast it with other focus
descriptors like product-driven, technology-driven, and marketing-driven.
Until recently I didn’t give the phrase much thought. I sort of knew what it
meant — and so did most people I spoke to — but to be honest I had a tough
time describing it. So what do I mean?

When taking a sales-driven approach you:

  1. Prioritize the curb-appeal of your product over long-term customer value. For example, you actively build and sell flashy features which provide limited lasting value or fail to deliver on the sales promise. In short, you focus on what sells or attracts attention vs. what works
  2. Allow sales opportunities to impact the product roadmap disproportionately. Agreeing to build something for a prospect is a major commitment, as even the savviest prospects tend to botch their requirements. It is also rare for a hastily developed feature to be productized vs. being held together with bailing wire for the customer. More often than not, the sales-driven roadmap item becomes a liability and sits in limbo.
  3. Let sales dictate the target persona (or lack thereof). As product people, we build products with specific “jobs to be done”, people, needs, and psychologies in mind. In a sales-driven approach, there will often be a mismatch between product’s target end users, and the people you sell to. Sometimes the sales target is simply broader, but often it is just plain different.
  4. Saying No is one of the toughest things in product management. When selling, you’ll inevitably hear about ancillary and complimentary needs. They love your product, and if it can do [insert something else] they’ll love it even more. A sales-driven approach tends to guide your product management hand a bit broader than a product-driven approach.
  5. A sales-driven company tends to prioritize developing new features over optimizing existing features for existing customers. A bulleted list of features is the calling card for new sales. The bigger the list, the more doors that open.

Most businesses need some form of sales. You can be amazingly good at sales,
but not be sales-driven. A product-driven company doesn’t stop selling …
rather it puts more emphasis on assuring that customers get value out of the
product vs. drive the car off the lot. Before jumping to the next feature, you
validate that you’ve hit the mark.

As a UX-centric product person, I tend to feel better about my work when I’m
working in a product-driven setting. It just feels more focused, sustainable,
and impactful. I’ve also been bitten numerous times by the byproducts of a
prolonged sales-driven effort. That said, countless businesses have succeeded
by taking a sales-driven stance. On some level, it boils down to your sense of
craft, and your tolerance for things to be a little less-than-ideal for your
existing customers.

And with some products you have no choice. The market is competitive, busy,
and fierce, and it is hard to sell on differentiation. No matter how you slice
it, your product is not going to sell itself. You will win BECAUSE you learn
how to out-sell and outmaneuver the competition. Like it or not, your product
is secondary.

### 45 Posts On Product Development

I turned around today to realize that I just published my 45th Medium Post.

Some of it is crappy. Some of it is inspired. Typos. Angst. I’ve done it all.

But there has been something very meditative about sitting down and cranking
one or two out each week. It has helped ME clarify my point of view.

Given that Medium doesn’t have a great index feature, I figured I’d provide
one here. I’m grateful for the folks who have taken the time to read and
comment.

# Before You Join A Startup …

When you join a venture-funded startup, remember that you’re playing someone

* * *

### Before You Join A Startup …

When you join a venture-funded startup, remember that you’re playing someone
else’s game.

There are plenty of business models — creative agencies / consultancies, for
example — that group people by a passion for doing great work and making a
reasonable salary. Most venture funded startups are not in this category. So
you have to come to accept that.

One of the harshest realities of the startup world is that what can be good
for your investors (and founders even), might not jive well with your sense of
craft, responsibility, and happiness. And that’s no one’s fault. It just is
how it is. The economics, risk profile, and odds dictate the tactics. The
letdown comes when you believe otherwise.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HqV_INUN2nZBDmCF-zHFbA.png)

<http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/24/deciphering-the-economics-of-venture-
capital/>

What is right for the customer, right for your sense of intellectual rigor,
and right for your sense of a job well done, aren’t always right for someone
else’s portfolio. Again, you’re playing two different games. You might be
trying to grow a healthy vegetable garden. They’re trying to build an oasis in
the desert. Your veggie garden is the much derided “lifestyle business”, while
their oasis is the Unicorn. Neither is bad.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_D7Yg02emrF-wyMZ2dHfeQ.png)

Reality check: some of the biggest venture “wins” come from land-grabs,
vaporware, accu-hires, and mediocre products. Interestingly, these wins are
often followed by refocusing on impact and culture — a big reversal — but
that’s for another post.

I remember being involved in the music business and watching my friends
struggle with the harsh world of the major labels. One month you were on top
of the world and the next month you were basically in $120k of debt to the
label. [Without that hit single, you weren’t much good to
anyone](http://www.negativland.com/news/?page_id=17). For better or worse
that’s how much of the startup world works.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aI6IcxOgEVCCGTG2OUj2Kw.png)

Much of the startup world revolves around the heuristic that high growth
validates the business model, and that you can always find more efficiencies
down the road. Unfortunately, this provides little solace to those on the
front-lines. “Making the number” often doesn’t equate to “job well done”
(unless you’re in sales). Some folks like [Jason
Fried](https://medium.com/u/c030228809f2) and David Heinemeier Hansson
([DHH](https://medium.com/u/54bcbf647830)) have advocated heavily for the
craft and empathy focused middle ground, the “indie rock” of the startup
world, but that is rare.

This tension forms the backdrop to countless startup water-cooler
conversations (or private Slack channels, or coffee maker chats … pick your
poison). It happens so predictably and consistently that it almost feels
cliche. Anyone who has done their time in startups knows the script.

As an individual, it is important to ask yourself the hard questions. What
inspires you? Why do you show up day after day? Are you in this for a small
chance at a big upside? If it all burns to the ground — and most of the time
it does (financially, morally, culturally, or otherwise) — will you be happy
you were along for the ride?

The startup world holds a certain seduction. It is stripped of the politics,
the hard-and-fast rules, and the monotony. But remember to take a step back
and look at the big picture.

I love startups. I love the ride. But I’ve learned to understand (and respect)
it for what it is. And alas the irony: at some point you’ll have your own
thing and need to make the hard decisions. It’s never easy, but it’s always
interesting!

### Quit Planning Ahead and Keeping People Busy

As product people, we need to work more on the mission and less on playing
Tetris with teams and initiatives. To much planning ahead and chasing full
utilization will undo your product.

> Oh oh! We we can finish that in 6 days, right?, and then we can rotate them
to project Z, and … oh, well Mandy will be done with that thing, and we can
slide that project in there. If they finish that afternoon, Bill will present
his mockups and we can start on …

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JiavS5lB-qVQNmaOKL8vnQ.png)

Your average PM will spend countless hours in meetings talking to non front-
line stakeholders about what their organizations will (or should) do at some
point in the future. They’ll make fancy gantt swim-lane roadmaps so that
everyone feels heard. And then talk about pet solutions, show mock-ups, make a
lot of guesses, play Tetris with initiatives, and pester engineers for
estimates. Towards what end? Why?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*15mf15mJocHueM9mNQJ6fA.png)

<https://siouxnetontrack.wordpress.com/page/8/>

They sincerely believe that this is their only option. Ironically, the more
they do it, the worse the results, and the more people feel that premature
alignment and multi-tasking are necessary. I mean gosh-golly, if we could just
“hit our commitments”! It’s a vicious cycle. But it doesn’t need to be that
way.

A microscopic amount of this “planning ahead” adds value. It is a symptom of
our preoccupation with full utilization, and it makes things WORSE.

We try to work out all the details in small groups so as not to “distract” the
teams while they juggle the four other things we’ve asked them to do. UX
hurries to prepare mock-ups (in isolation) so that the team will be able to
get started right away. More colorful lines get added to the roadmap swim-
lanes. And then what happens?

We spend days/weeks trying to re-calibrate with the reality on the ground, get
the team engaged with a vision they had no part of, and work through all of
our faulty assumptions. And then rush to get the feature shipped to shut
everyone up only to find we missed the mark because our batch was huge and we
had 10 things on deck.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Lo7EAH9vH8oqLDmMXDr7Rw.png)

Consider the alternative. The reality is you only need to plan for the very
next thing. And only in broad strokes. What counts is the mission: the
engaging outcome you hope to generate for your customers and business. Focus
instead (like 90%) on being present for the important task at hand. All this
other stuff — the freakish alignment meetings and pre-planning — is just
driven by people freaking out over nothing getting done.

What if the team finished what they were doing, and then engaged in a couple
of DAYS of collaborative design, spikes, and research? It might feel less
efficient, but it is far more effective. UX would sit down and work directly
with engineers to explore what was possible. Instead of paper prototypes,
you’d try testing working prototypes with real customer data. Simply put,
you’d be getting it done right.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*QDGubkwuQKlQePv2yg6BmA.png)

Take a step back, and ask yourself the hard question. Is any of the pre-
planning worth it? Really? If the team produced constant value and you could
prove it, would anyone care? Of course not, they’d keep letting you plow
along. Most people can’t because 80% of shipped features never really get used
or hit the mark. So as an alternative, we seek full utilization and the
fastest delivery of stakeholder guesses. That becomes our job.

Wrong! Don’t go there.

One of the biggest tips I can give product development teams is to keep the
planning inventory as low as possible. Get alignment on the mission, and stop
fixating on pet solutions. Slow down and focus to speed up. Don’t chase full
utilization. Let the team breath. Finish one thing and then start the next
thing. You’ll produce better results and move much faster.


# Enter Through The Narrow Gate (Go Deep)

### Enter Through The Narrow Gate (Go Deep)

> Matthew 7:13

Going broad is dangerous.

Imagine opening a sushi restaurant catering to both sushi aficionados and
sushi newbies. Try to decorate it to be a great date spot and a convenient
lunch option. Make it accessible to cost-conscious foodies and jet-setters.
Hire staff that can communicate with your Japanese clientele and explain sushi
to traveling Swedes. Seat people for 25 minutes and 3 hours. Does this sound
feasible?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*5-jWrdgukbnOoehFBRguBg.png)

Not really. I wouldn’t bet on it.

This type of broad focus is known as “going broad” and it is a startup killer.
Everything above falls under making “great sushi”, but the devil is in the
details. When it comes to startups, how do you know if you’re going too broad?

  1. You have to produce different marketing material for different buyers
  2. You find yourself dividing your limited resources among different product lines or value props
  3. You have a tough time understanding why a particular customer chose your product
  4. You find it difficult to prioritize work because the data is contradictory
  5. The features you do release only appeal to a small % of your customers
  6. Your support team struggles to service a wide variety of use case
  7. Your customers consider your product both “complicated” and “simple” simultaneously
  8. You take on service / consulting work to address the many edge cases
  9. You frequently receive diverse feature requests in the pre-sales process
  10. You find yourself describing your value proposition as being that of a platform, or a one-stop shop

As a startup PM, you’ll be always tempted to go broad. The temptation will be
fierce. Personally, you love your product, and you believe everyone should
too. It’s awesome to hear about all the compelling use cases people are
dreaming up, and all the minor (and major) enhancements they’d need to make it
all possible. So your heartstrings are being plucked.

Externally the pressure can be a lot tougher. Take the sushi venture example
above. You might find it easy to get all of those people to walk into your
restaurant. Signs and marketing do wonders. You’ve expanded your available
market to just about everyone. You might find it possible — through major
heroics — to please some portion of those people. All of that will make your
team euphoric. And once the ball starts rolling it is tough to put the brakes
on. But the mess you make in the process will be your undoing.

“Going broad” means trying to address the needs of too many buyer personas,
user personas, AND jobs to be done (desired work outcomes). They all matter.
Supporting the same user personas to do multiple jobs is difficult. Likewise,
supporting different types of users — even those with the same title — to do
the same job is equally complex. The tendency is to overgeneralize. You
segment by title (“accounts” for example) and perhaps business size (“SMB”),
but that’s about it. The differences between accountants working at SMBs are
vast.

We tend to model our startups after large enterprises while forgetting that it
took those companies many years (and decades in some cases) to support that
many product lines and use cases. It didn’t happen overnight. And it certainly
didn’t happen while they were trying to fight for their early existence.

The complexity of everything — product development, support, sales, and
marketing — increases exponentially with each buyer/user personas added to the
mix. No simple change in process will stem this tide.

So what do you do? I know this will be extremely painful and counterintuitive,
but get used to saying no much more than you say yes. By much more I’m talking
20x. Say no to prospects, no to feature requests, no to opportunities, no to
expansion, and no to new verticals.

This doesn’t mean don’t sell. Sell your heart out. But sell to one target
buyer personas and user persona.

And then, on the flipside, get extremely specific about the Who and the Why.
By extremely specific I am talking 20x more precise. People will get super
nervous because they’ll assume you’re limiting the TAM (total available
market) for your product. Rest assured that you’ll be better in the long run.

So: Say No. And Get Specific.

### The Unseen Product is Still The Product

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kBpFVCAYx6Ni-ovqM6bsHw.png)

My favorite metaphor … restaurants

Imagine that you are at a restaurant. As a customer, you interact with the
host, the server, the food and drink, and the dishes and decor. It’s unlikely
that you’ll see or be very aware of what’s going on in the kitchen. But it
would be wrong to say that you don’t care about the kitchen. You likely care
about the cleanliness of the kitchen. You appreciate it when the food comes
out quickly. And you’re more likely to come back if the chef has time to
create thoughtful and unique specials.

In product development, we tend to think in terms of a wall between the inner
workings of an application and the outer, customer-facing side. The inner
workings are the work of engineers, and the outer workings are the work of UX
designers, interaction designers, and others.

But, if you take a step back, it becomes clear that this line is not a clear
one, and that the way an application is built affects usability as much as the
outward-facing aspects. How quickly does the software work? How smoothly? How
gracefully does it recover from errors? For a customer, the kitchen is as
important as the service.

The perceived barrier between engineering and product carries over into the
work of teams. We create divisions so that we don’t step on each other’s toes.
Engineering says “just tell us what you need” and takes it from there. Product
lays claim to the outward-facing aspects and is told not to meddle.

Neither of these views really gets the job done, and the worst outcome is that
critical backend work — technical debt removal, refactoring, testing — becomes
hidden from view. These goals don’t show up on the roadmap. They aren’t part
of a bulleted list. And DevOps teams tend to work on these critical aspects
under the radar for fear that the time needed to do them will be grabbed for
other priorities. Or, companies sit on debt and delay addressing these issues
because they believe that at some later point they’ll have the time.

But product folks need to understand that this all contributes directly to the
end-product. It is crazy to turn a blind eye to it. Your next epic might very
well be a technical debt workdown, or a test coverage sprint. Not only does
the craft of DevOps contribute directly to the overall user experience, but
awesomely supported and appropriately architected software empowers you to
release product. It’s the foundation that allows you to ship fast and
fearlessly and gives you the freedom to experiment and create.

So take a whole-team approach to product development and expand your view of
what “customer-facing” means. Don’t let your unsung heroes to go unsung.
Embrace the craft of DevOps and seek synergy with an awesome customer-facing
UX team. Encourage people to be transparent about what they’re working on.
Keep in mind that many of the great products you love are great because of
DevOps and a dialed-in process.


# You Don’t Need A “Great Product”

There’s an uncomfortable truth about product development:

* * *

### You Don’t Need A “Great Product”

There’s an uncomfortable truth about product development:

It’s possible to hit the numbers and grow quickly with a crappy product
(and/or crappy organizational culture). It’s possible to have a grand exit
even when your team knows it is all snake-oil.

You can throw Lean Startup, 4 Steps to the Epiphany, The Hard Thing About Hard
Things, and Zero to One in the trash, and still do awesome. Yet we obsesses
about “Great Product”.

It will not last and at some point, you’ll end up paying for it. But if your
goal is “up and to the right” there are a million ways to grow. If you’re
lucky, you can keep this up for a long, long time. Long enough, perhaps, to
never have to deal personally with it. Long enough to enjoy a personal exit
event, take a break, and come back ready to build a “real” product.

I’m not talking in the very early stages. You’ll need to do something right at
that stage. Shortly after that you will see the signs. I spoke with a friend
recently who took a roller coaster ride with a big startup in NYC. “Everyone
knew from almost the beginning,” she explained, “that our model was
unsustainable and flawed. But at a certain point, you just get tired of making
the case. Everything was growing and looked good on paper, so we just went
with it.”

I hear this over and over. Those on the front-lines sense the problem very
early, but it can take years to work it out of the system.

Why does this happen?

Most tech startups make central assumptions about economies of scale. The
thought is that eventually, at some point, you’ll figure something out.
Someone will want to buy you for your tech (or people), you’ll find new and
cheaper channels, or you’ll find the right “synergy” with an acquirer. A lot
of tech innovation hinges on long term shifts in usage for “mainstream”
business (e.g. Bring Your Own Device, Enterprise Mobility, Big Data, etc.). So
it is possible to drink the Koolaid — maybe even spike it — for a long time.

The temptation to just keep growing is just too strong. And frankly, at a
certain point it can be tempting to cut product corners and leave certain
assumptions unvalidated.

So, let me get to the point. At the end of the day, you need to ask yourself
about what you value. What is your mission? What matters to you?

If it’s “go IPO”, “have an exit”, “make shit loads of money”, “get acquired”,
or anything like that … well, embrace the optics. Embrace all the ways you can
keep the train moving. Play that game.

If it’s “build stuff people love and make a difference” or “build a
sustainable model that keeps people employed making great software” (my
personal favorite) then embrace that. Let that muse guide you. You’ll need to
resist all sorts of temptation to cut corners early on. You’ll need to grow
more slowly and be intellectually and emotionally honest with yourself. But
just let that be your thing. You might even find that the prior goals just
happen organically.

Pick a path with no regrets.

Is Agile **dead**? Is it **outdated**? Does it **suck**?

You tell me … how many of your work interactions are:

Maybe for fleeting moment? Maybe for a year during the “good times”? Maybe
when you “had a great team once, on that project”?

Exactly. We can always do _better_. If scrum isn’t your thing, then find
something _better_.

Agile is a reminder that there’s always room for more empathy, happiness, and
impact in our work and personal lives. Beyond the infographics, methods,
acronyms, debates, books, white-papers, and rants, exists a simple set of
guidelines to [collaborate, deliver, reflect, and improve

This is why I’m so happy to be attending (and speaking at) Alistair Cockburn’s

### Focus is the Ultimate Process

When confronted with workplace dysfunction, missed connections, or poor
communication, we frequently assume that we need to address a process issue.
If we only had the right tools and the right systems, we could untangle
things. So we tweak and retweak processes, arrange meetings, and try to get
(or buy) systems that promise to link together all of the information team
members need and make it all work. But, does it ever _really _work?

What if process isn’t the problem?

We tend to identify problems as process problems when, in fact, they are focus
problems.

A great example is the question of how to handle customer feature requests. On
the surface it appears as if this is a process problem. How do you track those
requests, regularly update customers, and figure out how to prioritize those
requests in the product backlog? The temptation is to purchase a bunch of
tools and systems and implement a feature request tracking system. But, take a
step back. How awesome would it be if your team was always cranking out
valuable features? If, rather than fill the pipeline with requests to be
managed, you solved a focused problem and had customers lining up due to word
of mouth? How could you focus to make that happen?

From a broader organizational perspective, consider something like performance
reviews. In truth, we know that intrinsic motivation is what works, and yet we
create complex processes and systems of incentives to keep the ship on the
rails and to have a paper trail of accountability. But what if none of that
was a problem? What would it look like if everyone was held accountable by
their own passion for the work?

Process itself isn’t a problem. But when we’re working on process in product
development we should consider whether we’re really treating symptoms of a
lack of focus. Is that tracking system only needed because we’re trying to do
too many things at once? Do we think we need to massively customize a CRM when
really we’re just trying to handle too many customers at once? In start-ups it
is easy to mistake a problem as one of scaling or “growing pains,” when, in
fact, your problem is that you’re trying to cram in as much work as possible
rather than [do a few things well](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/enter-
through-the-narrow-gate-go-deep-c2d6528e380a#.o5n8ofmgq).

We need to differentiate between process that enables innovation, and process
that is applied from above to band-aid symptoms of a deeper problem. Ideal
process can be a dynamic, iterative working agreement among motivated people.
But process for its own sake or process that is used to exert control can be
poisonous. This is the reason so many management consultants and “change
initiatives” fail to achieve their goals.

### 12 Traits of a Powerful Product Vision

We tend to treat product visions as Tweet-length Mad Libs. They lack bite,
resonance, and cohesiveness. It just feels like you’re going through the
motions.

But what makes a product vision powerful? To me, the format matters less than
the content.

  1. It engages and inspires all members of the team. It presents a goal that unites the development team, the customers and users, and the business. Proposing a business goal without describing the human benefits doesn’t provide inspiration.
  2. It connects the _who_ and the _why_ through a narrative. It identifies the human beings involved and the outcomes you’d like to create for them. It is phrased in a way that identifies its impact on people, even if you’re talking about machines and code.
  3. It has a clear story arc that leads from now into the future. It describes the present state, the change needed, and the vision of a better state.
  4. It is written in language that the whole team understands and avoids marketing-speak or overly technical language. It should be easy to explain to new team members, even if they don’t know all of the details.
  5. It is presented in ways that engage various senses and ways of understanding — visual and auditory as well as verbal.
  6. It is detailed enough to feel precise and focused, but broad enough to leave room for creativity and individuality. Team members have leeway to dream up solutions.
  7. It provides enough direction for team members to take action. It makes it easy for them to make decisions. It provides a true north. Team members don’t need to second-guess themselves or ask for permission.
  8. It is singular and dominant and matches the reality of the team’s activities. Other activities don’t take up 80% of the team’s time. Your vision comprises the 80%, and other tasks are the periphery.
  9. There is a clear goal that the team can strive for in the immediate future, even if the overall vision is open-ended. There are ways to know if you’re on track (leading indicators) and ways to know that your efforts made a difference (trailing indicators and outcomes).
  10. It is achievable, or at least allows for concrete incremental progress. It doesn’t feel purely aspirational or top-down.
  11. It is logically connected to a larger goal, if one exists. If the mission addresses a problem in order to allow progress on a different problem, that relationship is clear.
  12. Team members can take it seriously, knowing that they won’t see the company do things that clash with the vision. No one just gives it lip service. If you were to put it up on the wall, no one would think it was annoying. In other words, it passes the bullshit test.


# Where Do We Put The UX Tasks?

In my career I’ve heard this conversation play out over and over:

* * *

### Where Do We Put The UX Tasks?

In my career I’ve heard this conversation play out over and over:

**Eng:** “Um, we have no idea what UX is even doing.”  
**UX:** “OK, why don’t we try to add the UX tickets to Jira.”  
**Eng:** “Um. Damn. That many stories? That is going to clutter everything up.”  
**UX:** “Product, what should I be getting ahead of … ?”  
**Prod:** “Well, um, I have this Google Doc you can look at.”  
**Eng:** “What’s next? Is this ready to be worked on?”

I’ve seen teams try these three options to remedy the situation:

#### Option 1: Keep UX work in a separate system

Product and UX maintains intricate to-do lists for design and research work
OUTSIDE of the primary ticketing system.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*A3aIVO8RHXo9Z_wavFQ8Dw.png)

  * **_Pros:_** It keeps the ticketing system “clean and uncluttered.”
  * **_Con:_** No one knows what UX is working on, and it is impossible to view the dependencies. The backlog is obscured making it tough to get the “big picture”

**Notes: **UXers often have a difficult time explaining the rhythm of their work. They regularly scan for work on the horizon, and “get ahead” of that work by doing research, producing mockups, tinkering, etc. These systems are highly individual. I’ve seen designers use Trello, Basecamp, Google Tasks, stickies, and their notebooks to manage this work. In many cases, it goes unappreciated simply because it is not visible.

#### Option 2: Track UX work in the ticketing system as distinct and separate
tickets

When UX is working on something, it is described as being In Progress (along
with engineering work)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yJxE4NZ8nqkBuGo3mpiTWw.png)

  * **_Pros:_** A clear sense of WIP (work in progress), and the current burden on UX
  * **_Con:_** Too much clutter / too many tickets, and UX work often falls out of sync with release cycle

**Notes:** The trouble here is that design work itself is not shippable, and again it often doesn’t flow in the same way that engineering work flows. So you’ll finish a sprint and the board — digital or physical — will become cluttered with design tickets. Ideally, you’ll have a “Shipped” status, and therein lies the problem. Unless this design work is related to a customer-consumable / shippable item, it isn’t Done. You could argue that this approach is problematic for user-stories in general. Any time you break up a story based on functional roles (back-end/front-end, for example), you are diluting the story and creating a dependency management game.

#### Option 3: Track UX as work related to user-focused tickets

UX work is attached to a user-focused story, from early phase backlog
refinement to shipped/done

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EyWfsXX4vnYjYRcJjXsQpg.png)

  * **_Pros:_** Clearly describes dependencies. Allows for a “pull” system for design and research which promotes just-in-time work. Remains very user-goal focused
  * **_Cons:_** May require sub-tasks, and multiple people assigned to a particular ticket. Requires strong stories and story splitting practices

**Notes:** If UX is getting involved on a ticket before engineering (in an analysis/ design/research phase), then it is reasonable to call that work exactly what it is: analysis/design/research. It is similar to the work of engineering architects, business analysts, etc. Some models, like LeanUX, favor less upfront work and eschew the staggered sprint approach. Other teams do a good bit of pre-planning and design before they hand it off to engineering. When the work starts, it typically throws off lots of design tasks along with QA and engineering tasks. These remain with the story.

My bias is for Option 3. It strikes the best balance between:

  1. Preventing unnecessary pre-work (we’ve all had efforts killed after being reassured that the work was, in fact, going to happen)
  2. Keeping the system clean
  3. Reflecting reality
  4. Clearly describing the value-stream, as work further to the right gets closer to release and customer outcomes
  5. Giving “credit” to UX for the work they do that goes unappreciated

Let me know what you think. What has worked for you?

How true! When I am talking to a new team, there is one thing I zero in on
very early in the game. It sits below all the methodologies, practices,
cultural manifestos, and vision statements. It is the absolute prerequisite to
meaningful continuous improvement.

Can your whole team get “real” when it counts? Is it safe for someone to say:

> “I’m not comfortable about where this project is going …”

> “We’re feeling a bit bullied lately …”

> “I’m overwhelmed, and I can’t reasonably keep up with this workload …”

> “This isn’t meeting my expectations …”

> “I’m confused about what we stand for here …”

> “We aren’t living up to our mission and here’s why …”

Common wisdom says that these types of conversations are out of bounds. You’ll
hear arguments like “people aren’t comfortable talking about this kind of
stuff” or “this is better off dealt with in a much smaller group.” We seek to
contain this talk, subdue it, and silence and control it. Even the thought of
“going there” feels a little awkward and scary.

If you let these tensions fester, you’ll often start hearing small groups of
people say things like:

> “It isn’t worth bringing it up anymore. We just can’t change this.”

> “That’s just the way it is. Not much we can do about it.”

> “Let’s keep this between you and me …”

> “I don’t feel comfortable talking to [my boss] about this. She’s part of the
problem.”

> “I’m just waiting for the most politically opportune time to … ”

At any given point our organizations carry the “debt” of these unresolved
tensions. Importantly, different individuals process these pressures in a
variety of ways. Some people:

  * can disconnect at the end of a challenging day, month, or quarter. Unless the dissonance threatens their job, they’ll take a certain level of dissonance in stride
  * internalize that tension. It’s stressful, but they aren’t wired to fight or raise a stink
  * form alliances and pockets of resistance, and share gripes to blow off steam
  * serve as spokesperson for the less vocal team members, and take the brunt of the pushback
  * just up and leave

The important point here is that you wont always see a mass exodus or a big
uprising.

These unresolved tensions can hamper an organization for years because the
impact is rarely some cataclysmic event that rocks the system at its core. The
fed up folks will leave. And those who remain will find a way to coexist,
accepting the fact that it isn’t quite safe enough to openly voice their
concerns. What permeates is an all too common “low-level dissatisfaction” …
people don’t love what is going on, but they don’t hate it enough (or their
living situation doesn’t allow) for them to leave.

The irony is that it is these very same people that get called out for being
disengaged when the consultants role in.

We direct much attention towards change management. In my experience, the
seeds of change are already present in your organization. At some level —
typically the level closest to the work — there is an awareness of what is
“wrong”. The trick is creating an environment which is safe enough to let
those with that awareness speak openly and own a path forward. Without that
safety, no amount of process, assistance from consultants, hyping the culture,
or empty statements of vision will allow you to turn the corner.

What has worked for you? How do you create this level of safety?

It’s just a _lifestyle_ business for them.

As opposed to?

Something bigger. Something that’ll grow. You know, just more _serious_.

I don’t know. She really loves the small team vibe and building a great
product without the politics.

But that can’t _scale_! You know that. How are they going to take that to the
_next level_?

What’s the next level? How do you level-up?

_Bigger_ customers. _More_ customers. I mean at some point someone needs to
get a return … right? It shows a real lack of _ambition_ if you ask me.

I think they’re doing pretty well actually. And they don’t owe anyone any
money.

Exactly. It’s a _lifestyle_ business. It affords her and the team a certain
_lifestyle_. Nothing more. Do you see the pictures on Facebook of her on
vacation and stuff? It’s for that. That’s a _lifestyle_.

You mean, it doesn’t consume your life? Isn’t playing the startup game a
lifestyle decision? Look at all of these people in this cafe talking about
pivots, exits, and disruption. This sort of seems like a _lifestyle_.

It’ll only go far! What’s the most she’ll ever pocket … a couple million?
(Turns to eye the people walking into the cafe)

I think they’ve done studies on this. I’m not sure you’re happier after $100k
a year (or something close to that). She legitimately enjoys showing up,
working with the team, and building something people enjoy using. It’s like a
group of craftsmen. Or a really good auto-shop or something.

Exactly! Those are **_LOCAL_** businesses. Come on, you know what we’re
talking about. The **_SHOW_**. The **_GAME!_** Do you know how much [ — — — ]
grew last quarter? That is SICK! That’s leverage …

How will that actually help the majority of people at [ — — —] ? Three years
from now when they’ve been acquihired, management turns over, and they’ve
pivoted six times … what will it all mean? And point of note … there are three
doctor’s offices within a mile from here that have more revenue than half of
the startups you’re “tracking”.

That’s the price of progress. Of growth. Did Google think small?

You could argue that Google figured out how to print money. And they were
passionate about something. Just like our friend.

… Look over there. That’s [ — — — ] from [ — — —]. I wonder if they’re doing a
deal? I’ve heard some whispers ….

Listen to yourself. This is totally a _lifestyle_ for you!

No it’s not … it’s a _passion_.

And …

We live in San Francisco. Tell me with a straight face that this isn’t a
_lifestyle_ …

Um. I mean I guess it is a “way of life”

And …

OK. It’s a _lifestyle_.

So it is all a lifestyle choice. There you go.

### Focus on These 8 Things to Build Better Products

If you focus on these eight concepts you _WILL_ build better products. It will
not be easy, and it will not be instant. You’ll probably get a lot of pushback
and ruffle some feathers, but I promise that your product/service will
benefit.

As product development teams we spend a great deal of time looking for “the
answer”. We often adopt methodologies as a safety blanket, and then lose faith
when the situation changes. Sure, I’ve provided some examples. But your teams
are smart! Let them experiment with the how. Paint these broad goals and let
them lead you.

Build a better product by …

#### **1\. Shortening the distance between the product development team (UX
and engineering) and the customer**

_For example …_

  * Team fieldtrips to visit customers onsite
  * Biweekly lunch and learns with moderated customer discussion
  * Allow any front-line team member to pick up phone and call customer
  * Hire full-time UX researchers, with goal to share research and engage others in research

**Why?** With each hop you lose signal. Efforts to filter this information to make it more “actionable” are largely ineffective

#### **2\. Accelerating any form of learning about your customers, market,
technology, self, team, and organization**

_For example …_

  * Regular team retrospectives, outings, and conversations
  * Voice-of-customer programs, access to accurate usage metrics, regular presentations on competitors and trends
  * [Pairing](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html), [mob-programming](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwjjlLHTm5LNAhUj6oMKHVMECWYQFggcMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmobprogramming.org%2F&usg=AFQjCNFVo2f2MB1mXp_PVpzRpid13GOfcg&bvm=bv.123664746,d.dmo), mentor program
  * Offer experiment-design training, and share results broadly
  * Celebrate learning! Share broadly. Share visibly

**Why? **Your team’s collective learning is your organization’s foremost asset. Left unshared, it depreciates almost immediately

#### **3\. Watching a real user use your product to get their job done**

_For example …_

  * Moderated and unmoderated usability tests
  * Diary studies with screen-share (e.g. always-on GoToMeeting study)
  * Session recording, click-stream analysis

**Why? **To get out of your own head! No use is arguing about whose guess is better

#### **4\. Making it possible to deliver software more fearlessly and with
less drama**

_For example …_

  * Test driven development, automated testing, CI, “stop the line” mandate (with no repercussions)
  * Feature flags, beta groups, prototype framework
  * Invest in DevOps

**Why?** If you work scared, you’ll take no risks

#### **5\. Reducing the number of dependencies and constraints**

_For example …_

  * SOA, plan for obsolescence and change vs. hardening and future-proofing
  * Teams aligned around distinct value streams vs. organized around architecture or skill-sets
  * Fewer promises to customers, and other stakeholders (internal and external)
  * Late binding of teams (vs. pre-assigning epics to teams months in advance)
  * Just-in-time planning, co-design, design sprints, etc.

**Why?** You can’t move quickly with your hands tied. And if you try, you’ll have mediocre results

#### **6\. Promoting diversity, and engaging the minority viewpoint**

_For example …_

  * Diverse hiring teams, self-selecting teams and projects, voluntary team rotation
  * Tailor activities to different communication and learning styles
  * Leaders speak last. Coach on listening and communication skills (while respecting diversity)
  * Anonymous surveys (if safety level is low)
  * [Ritual dissent](http://cognitive-edge.com/methods/ritual-dissent/)

**Why**? If everyone thinks the same and is forced to agree with the loudest voice, you’ll never explore different perspectives.

#### **7\. Fostering creativity and freedom to explore and experiment**

_For example …_

  * Describe the end-goal vs. a particular solution. In other words, promote creative solutions for “normal” work
  * Teams self-select stretch innovation project after completing “normal” feature
  * Get individuals out of functional silo (UXers code, engineers design)
  * 10% time, idea marketplaces (Tinder for collaborating on projects), co-design with customers

**Why:** If you are 100% delivery focused, you’ll eventually hit the point when the luck runs out. We all crave a sense of impact and get a buzz from trying something new. Bonus: this is how you innovate … not some lab or hack day.

#### 8\. Bridging silos

_For example …_

  * All employees spend time in support queue
  * Marketing and sales engaged in group design activities
  * Front-line teams present to senior management (not a middle-person)

**Why:** Silos inhibit the flow of information.


# That B2B SaaS Savvy Thing

I have received a lot of questions about a graphic I posted on Twitter
recently:

### That B2B SaaS Savvy Thing

I have received a lot of questions about a graphic I [posted on Twitter
recently](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/746480856122941440):

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*s1SM8b3qHrOvaVIZ1fUwUw.png)

Let me explain it in more depth.

Product personas often feature some version of the “savviness” scale. The idea
is pretty simple: some humans are skilled at [insert competency here], and
others are not. An accounting product might feature:

  * Accounting savvy
  * Technical savvy
  * Management savvy

The challenge is as follows. Product and UX are acutely aware that it is
difficult to build a product for users with different savviness levels. But it
can be tough to line up the organization around that conviction, especially in
the light of mixed messages from the market.

Prospects with **low savvy **can be relatively easy to sell to and close. They
feel the pain acutely, but are less demanding and selective. The trouble
arrises when you try to make these customers successful with the product.
Let’s say you lack exercise savvy and are rapidly gaining weight. You’ll be
easily persuaded to join a gym (**high perceived product value**). But you’ll
need constant monitoring, coaching, and coaxing (**low ability to be
successful with product**). Confoundingly, this has nothing to do with budget.
Some of the biggest deals come from the least savvy prospects.

**Medium savvy** customers are a mysterious bunch. They’re aware enough to know what’s possible, and shop more aggressively. The RFP magically grows in scope as they eagerly pile on feature requirements. When I worked at a bike store we joked that the “moderately informed” customer was the toughest to sell and please. But once you got them on a good bike (and put to rest their misguided assumptions) they had the most fun! So they may initially see **low perceived value** in the product, but have the **most to gain** in their **ability to be successful **with the product.

**High savvy** customers, on the other hand, are selective but realistic. They understand the limits of products, and mix-match to achieve their goals. For example, I am a savvy user of analytics tools. Yes I’m somewhat finicky about features, but I know that you need a quiver of tools to do the best job, and that there is often no one right way. I’m able to extract a lot of value out of products, but in so doing they become somewhat interchangeable. The delta from perceived value to actual value is diminished compared to the **medium savvy** user.

The takeaways is that the behavioral traits that might predict a sale are
often not the same traits that will indicate the ability for a customer to
thrive using your product. This isn’t to imply that targeting less savvy users
is a bad idea but rather that _trying to target all three is a bad idea
_(unless you’ve truly nailed one, and are ready to branch out). Even if the
sales are rolling in. Someone (usually customer success, customer support, or
product) will feel the sting.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*feWFzjTjlWXhUxdYna7YZg.png)

You need to target the same persona with intent across the full customer
journey including marketing, sales, on-boarding, product, and customers
success. They’re unique, and each require a unique approach. Don’t silo the
persona building activity inside the product team. Extend it across the whole
organization, and align around that vision.

### 44 Signs You Are Becoming a “Real” PM/PO

How do you know you’re on your way to earning your PM/PO wings? What signals
progress? Your first release? Getting “certified” ? Putting together a pretty
roadmap?

No …

  1. You’ll feel like you are annoying the crap out of your team
  2. You’ll find yourself sheepishly asking for an estimate
  3. You’ll realize that estimates are worthless, but still be pressured for a “rough sense of timeframe”
  4. You’ll struggle to explain why your intuition is valid (and be right)
  5. You’ll struggle to explain why your intuition is valid (and be wrong)
  6. You’ll be pressured to ship something before it’s ready
  7. You’ll try to make something perfect when you should have shipped it months ago
  8. You’ll face the harsh reality of a usability test
  9. You’ll put together the best roadmap in the world, and get everyone to buy-in, and then everything will change in an instant
  10. You’ll forget a seemingly trivial detail that will cause a massive delay
  11. You’ll rabbit hole on a seemingly important detail that will cause a massive delay for no apparent customer value
  12. You’ll be blamed for being too solution focused
  13. You’ll be blamed for being too high level
  14. You’ll find out that a new competitor is killing it
  15. You’ll have to break crappy news to your team (often admitting that you’re to blame)
  16. You’ll be jealous about ___________ and how they do product (and be reminded of that fact because they incessently blog about it)
  17. You’ll fancy yourself as technical but be humbled daily
  18. You’ll fancy yourself as UX-savvy but be humbled daily
  19. You’ll fancy yourself as business-savvy but be humbled daily
  20. You’ll say “my team”, but feel oddly distant from your team
  21. You’ll be worried about “distracting” your team, and find yourself not being transparent. And this will come back to haunt you
  22. You’ll find yourself parroting something engineers told you, and realize just how little you understand
  23. You’ll be asked to make your backlog / roadmap more visible, but then be derided when you shift things around
  24. You’ll have a day filled with meetings, and realize you added absolutely no value
  25. You’ll run a great meeting, and no one will notice
  26. You’ll work up a full-fledged wireframe, and then try to tell your UX team member that you don’t have a design in mind
  27. You’ll ship a dud feature that no one uses
  28. You’ll ship an awesome feature that no one even notices
  29. You’ll have to implement an exec’s idea, and know it sucks. And then have to live through the success theater that accompanies the release of said idea
  30. You’ll try to follow up on the impact of shipped features, but get overwhelmed by the next batch
  31. You’ll want to pull your hair out listening to your team debate the technical merits of two, almost identical approaches
  32. You’ll advocate for your pet solution against an almost identical team proposed approach
  33. You’ll tell a customer “it’s on the roadmap” and hear them laugh out loud
  34. You’ll say “No” to something just to prove to yourself that you have some influence and a point of view, and then realize that doing that is stupid
  35. You’ll say “Yes” to a customer in a moment of pure delusion, and then find yourself stubbornly trying to defend a feature that only they will use
  36. You’ll hear that you are not technical enough for the role
  37. You’ll hear that you are too technical for the role, and lack the soft skills
  38. You’ll go to a conference and learn about Lean Startup, and then come back to work and realize that the word hypothesis scares the shit out of people
  39. You’ll be the single wringable neck
  40. You’ll find yourself running cover for your team
  41. You’ll find yourself cursing your team under your breath
  42. You’ll be “empowered” on paper, but find yourself taking orders
  43. You’ll catch yourself giving orders, and learn to empower your team instead
  44. You’ll think you’ve learned from your mistakes, and you’ll magically make them again (just to make sure the learning is ingrained)

…. Because being a PO/PM is hard! It’s humbling, demanding, weird, nebulous,
and ever-changing. You’re going to screw up! Accepting that is one of the
significant hurdles of becoming a _better_ PM. You’ll figure out how little
you know and how little power you have, only to be reminded that it is often
the little things that count.

The key is never to stop being humble, empathetic, and curious. Don’t be
afraid to discuss your needs and challenges with your team. Be human! And
resist the slippery slope to burnout, egotism / mini-CEOism / backlog-
ownerism, political gamesmanship, and perpetual mistrust.

Start with your own Why. What do you care about? How do you want to work with
the people around you? Answer those questions and the rest will fall into
place.

### Be the Laziest Team and Win

I often challenge teams with the following question:

_What would happen if you stopped building anything new? Just stopped? Killed
the backlogs and roadmaps? Burned it down? Acted like a stubborn mule?_

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pFxwgQhLWn8Ns8ohpklrXg.png)

HERMANN G. SIMON — The Stubborn Mule (1881)

Try asking!

Someone is usually quick to say “we’d lose our jobs” (which is likely true
given how most orgs work), but after the nervous laughing subsides the
conversation gets interesting. Invariably, when pushed, a brave soul will come
forward and say “you know, I’m not sure things will change all that much!”

Blasphemy! Make, build, grow, get things done, check things off, and stay
busy. It’s who we are, right? There’s always room for another lawn gnome …

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YVKxBy5UVhm_7TqtM5sBlQ.png)

Engineers are “resources” that must be “fully utilized” and kept from being
“idle”. “What would we do all day? Just sit around and refactor the code, tool
up, and knock out bugs?” Keep the line rolling …

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pNkisQVNZtARLm9L2GcV2g.png)

1937 Ford Assembly Line

Continue the thought experiment. If you were to stop shipping new stuff,
**WHAT** would happen and **WHEN** would it happen ? Would you miss a sales
goal or growth goal? Would churn increase? Would the competition trounce you?
And **how do you know**?

Pretty quickly you will get to the crux of the matter. And often you’ll
discover that building more stuff isn’t necessarily the only way to solve the
problem.

The irony is that we disincentivize our front-line resources — often the one’s
who know best — from asking these questions. Their job descriptions don’t read
“push back on adding ANY new complexity to the product unless we have
demonstrated that the value is a massive multiple of costs.” Instead, most
organizations and individuals celebrate output over outcomes, and shipping
over validating. Try revisiting your release notes from a couple of quarters
ago? What happened? Do you even remember what you shipped?

If we have so many ideas … then some of them MUST be good.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*W6IKuM0gqkkpSmOYHHISzQ.png)

<http://saralouhicks.com/how-we-published-our-product-roadmap-to-the-world-
using-google-sheets-as-our-cms/>

In a weird form of Parkinson’s Law, teams are invariably able to fill the
backlog with ideas that seem reasonably valuable (or at least valuable in
comparison to each other). There’s always some new magic bullet to build or
table stakes addition. Ideas are cheap. The items are stacked back to back
with little opportunity to validate outcomes delivered.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jgAybmCcKRPL7TeOAxsU_g.png)

Why is leaving marginally validated new stuff in the product so harmful? It’s
super expensive!

Shipping new stuff creates instant debt beyond the resources consumed for the
initial build (which — while diligently estimated and obsessed over — often
comprise a small % of the overall cost). You’re in the red immediately. You’ve
got to service it, maintain it, sell it, market it, and document it. It limits
your turning radius. Take your engineering costs and multiply it by 10 (and
then charge regular interest) to get a better idea of the outcomes you must
deliver to make it all worth it.

Why would you ever want to leave those features in the product?

So try the thought experiment with your team. What would happen if the default
stance was to continuously work down debt (UX, technical, etc.), and to **test
rigorously, and in most cases kill, new idea**s? What if the rallying call was
efficacy and not efficiency or velocity? What if you encouraged people to do
the least amount of building necessary to achieve the required outcomes?

Try asking the question:

_What would happen if you were very stubborn about adding anything new?_

### 35 B2B SaaS Tips and Gentle Reminders

> The desire for safety stands against every great and noble enterprise —
Tacitus

> The second mouse gets the cheese! — Terry Pratchett

It’s a listicle kind of night. And the topic is B2B Saas!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YrN3kttaDgOW2058NS8XVg.png)

  1. The broader the product, and the more pains it promises to address, the “easier” it will be to sell. It’s like casting a larger net, or putting on a buffet.
  2. The breadth of a product has an exponential impact on product complexity, cost to service, cost to market, cost to sell, and cost to remain agile
  3. The broader the product, and the more diverse the customer population, the harder it will be to innovate in such a way as to keep all customers happy
  4. A product that can be used to achieve a goal for savvy customers is not the same as a product that delivers that outcome to all customers
  5. Early deals/customers bought into the dream and got lots of love. Their churn and retention rates are not representative
  6. It is virtually impossible to think clearly when considering the true costs and rewards of building a feature to close a deal. But sometimes it works out
  7. Can you hire a reasonably smart 24-year-old, without a Rolodex, and have them close quality deals in 4–6 months? Test that out
  8. At some point, you’ll have a quarter that invites the skeletons out of the closet. You can soften this blow if you keep your ears to the ground and listen to the front-lines
  9. Sales indicate you’ve discovered a pain worth solving. Usage and renewal indicate that your product solves that pain
  10. No news is not good news. Welcome the feature requests, blistering feedback, and support tickets (to a point). It shows someone is taking notice
  11. Rapid growth and learning aren’t always great bedfellows. Resist the urge to lock down structures, processes, comp plans, or pricing to the point that you stop experimenting
  12. Doubling the size of your team does not make it 2x more efficient OR effective
  13. Be diligent about calculating your cost of acquisition (CAC). What was involved in closing the deal? Who was involved?
  14. Will someone take you to their next job? That’s an excellent sign
  15. In the case of a highly aspirational product, don’t be too critical of churn. Sometimes it just isn’t a great fit, and that’s OK.
  16. You can explain NPS away. But the reality remains
  17. Beware of the platform trap. Yes, you will draw in prospects who wanted everything “all in one place”. Can you deliver that better than a selection of best in breed products?
  18. Have a reason to exist beyond growing, and meeting quotas. Those are things required to realize your higher mission, not an end unto themselves
  19. Keep a tab on sales and support heroics. The goal is to make that not necessary rather than making it commonplace. Those early hires get tired!
  20. Demonstrating ROI is a product mandate, not just something you put in your sales presentations. If you aren’t producing results and outcomes, it will eventually come back to haunt you
  21. If the customer was not actively using the competitor’s product, then it’s likely that they weren’t your competitor. You didn’t displace them. The same forces (the status quo in their organization) will also challenge usage of your product
  22. Customers expect startups to innovate/expand their product. That’s part of the reason for buying. Couple that with founders selling, and you’ll have big shoes to fill down the road
  23. In many domains (e.g. analytics, AR, machine learning, mobile, etc.) you’ll get a lot of experimental budgets thrown your way. Differentiating between experimental budget and real budget can be difficult
  24. Understand why each customer purchased your product. The “real” why even if it doesn’t fit into a neat box on a spreadsheet
  25. Hopefully, using your product will inspire your customers. But if you haven’t addressed their use case lately, it may encourage them to replace you now they’ve figured out what outcomes they can drive
  26. Keep a watch out for the non-competitor who is learning from all of your mistakes, and all of your progress. Especially if they have a lot more money
  27. Low total cost of ownership (TCO) is a double-edged sword. Without skin in the game, it can be difficult to differentiate experimentation from commitment
  28. Keep things simple! It is tempting to think you’ve expanded your ability to do multiple things at once. The reality is that things are still changing quickly and that you’re likely still in learning mode (vs. execution mode)
  29. When trying to understand value, look for a benchmark purchase in the organization. How much do they spend on coffee, lunches, and onboarding their new employees?
  30. It’s almost always easier to go upmarket with a validated product than it is to target SMBs after pursuing “enterprise” sized deals
  31. Watch out for having too many cooks in the kitchen. Especially experienced cooks. You’ll have to say no to 95% of your good ideas, even if they don’t involve engineering, and that can be hard for folks who know the “right” things to do
  32. Beware of strong relationship selling. If you’re a sales ninja, it can be relatively easy to persuade someone to buy. Ask how you’ll make that customer successful, and whether you have other customers that look just like this customer
  33. The word “enterprise” is often misleading. There are plenty of companies who will pay enterprise amounts, but who don’t require an enterprise sales approach
  34. Watch for the invisible costs of your current approach, and try to anticipate when you’ll need to pay off the interest (and at what rate). Carrying technical, UX, team culture, or learning debt will eventually need to be paid off. When?
  35. Look at your marketing and messaging. If you keep waffling between multiple messages and pitches, ask yourself why that is happening. Schizophrenic product? Too broad? Broad on purpose?


# 5 Simple Questions to Drive Validated Learning

* * *

### 5 Simple Questions to Drive Validated Learning

Here is a simple model that frames product development as an effort to trigger
a change in user behavior. It is accessible and not too jargon-laden. It can
be used to describe things on the highest level — a whole business, for
example — or a specific, low-level design change.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gsDRyfZEkjvaDzOJJTgGeA.png)

#### Whose behavior will change because of the work?

Our product development efforts target people who share some common traits and
characteristics. What are those traits and characteristics, and who are the
people that meet those traits and characteristics?

**Example:** Customer Service Reps (CSRs) at technology savvy companies and their Customers.

#### What is their current behavior?

What pattern of behavior are we hoping to change? This behavior can be
extremely specific — like a particular navigation flow or interaction — or it
can be very broad like purchasing habits, lifestyle choices, or major life
decisions. How often does it happen? How ingrained is the behavior? How does
the Target benefit from the existing behavior, or at a minimum put up with it?

**Example:** Customers currently submit cases via an online form, and then wait up to 24hrs for a reply. The CSRs currently monitor a case queue and communicate with Customers using email and on rare occasions, the phone. The VP of CS believes that opening up a direct channel will overwhelm the team and may not provide them flexibility in responding to case volume.

#### How will their behavior change?

Something will change as a result of our intervention. Will the user start or
stop doing a particular activity? Will they do something more or less often?
Will their outlook change? Will they give you more money and your competitors
less money? Will they use your impressive new search feature instead of
spending time navigating the tab structure?

**Example:** Customers will use a communication channel “in-app” that resembles a chat interface instead of using the online case submission forms. They’ll feel comfortable interacting with a rep via chat. CSRs will respond to these in-app messages as if they were virtual telephone calls (and do so immediately, personably, and directly).

#### How will we intervene?

In the example above, the behavior change actually includes the proposed
Intervention (in-app chat). The intervention might be a change in design, a
change in tactics, or a change in in packaging, messaging, or technology.
We’re mixing the pot in some way and hopefully something will happen.

**Example:** A new online home selling platform triggers a Target who previously would only sell using a broker to take on the task of selling their own house, and to fork over a fixed fee of $2,000. The Intervention is a virtual coach that adapts advice to local and regional requirements for home selling.

#### How will the new behavior benefit the user/business?

The behavior change must result in some benefit for it to “stick”. Without a
significant payoff, you’ll be hard-pressed to persuade someone to change their
mindset and habits. Big payoffs can reinforce significant behavior changes
(like paying your company a lot more money). The benefit is the return on
investment, where the _investment_ is some shift from the status quo.

**Example:** Customers will enjoy the personal touch. CSRs will deliver faster customer service without the hassle of a phone conversation. The CSR’s employer will have higher customer retention while keeping their CSR budget reasonably small.

#### Validated Learning

In the spirit of validated learning, we attempt to validate the various
assumptions — explicit and implicit — in the framework:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YculttC5xLDY8W-9-Zyxow.png)

  * The Target exists, and can be isolated and targeted consistently
  * The Target’s current behavior exists, and can be measured and understood
  * We can change the Target’s behavior with our Intervention
  * We can measure and understand their new behavior
  * The new behavior triggers a benefit (Outcome) for the Target
  * The Target values the Outcome sufficiently to change their behavior permanently

In most cases, just validating one piece of the puzzle (the Outcome for
example) is not sufficient. You need the full picture. And it is easy to get
bogged down in the weeds — a particular intervention, for example — and lost
sight of the major benefits required to really change the ballgame.

#### Innovation

Additionally, on a high level we can also use this framework to understand the
various types of innovation. Some examples:

  * Discovering new and underserved Targets
  * Address the needs of a large Target with a small behavior change and a small, but proportionately valuable benefit
  * Address the needs of a narrow Target with a large behavior change and large benefit
  * Figure out how to create a better outcome without significantly changing someone’s behavior
  * Figure out how to trigger significant behavioral changes that result in a big benefit

Innovation changes one or more parts of the equation in new and novel ways.

* * *

And that’s that. Talk these questions over with your team, and prioritize your
product development efforts to successively validate the various parts of the
framework.

### Chasing Revenue Growth (and Hidden Costs)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*CngWKQyzvq75ZCfY_Ykfiw.png)

I am an avid cyclist, and have also had the privilege of coaching a couple of
talented bike racers.

One approach to assessing an athlete (not my preferred strategy) is to set a
schedule of ever-increasing training loads. The idea is that the athlete will
eventually hit the wall and that you will have established their upper bounds
for withstanding the training stress. This approach is similar to a venture
capital firm setting a ramped ladder of revenue targets. They expect some of
their portfolio companies to “hit the wall” and “crash and burn”, but that’s
just how the cookie crumbles.

The danger here — as with startups — is that a highly motivated person can
usually find a way. We are incredibly adaptable, and can push ourselves for
many, many months. Overtraining doesn’t creep up linearly. I’ve had cyclist
friends dig a hole for years before it caught up with them. The onslaught of
fatigue and poor motivation was sudden, and there was no quick fix. It didn’t
mean they were untalented cyclists. On the contrary, they tended to be the
most talented (and most motivated).

<https://statumentis.wordpress.com/2014/12/01/overtraining-is-of-great-
importance-to-the-high-performance-athlete-we-need-to-gain-knowledge/>

Usually, there was some part of the formula that was a bit off. And being
truly motivated and hell-bent athletes, they just “pushed through”. The
tragedy is that some of these people quit!

To build a long term career (either amateur or professional) the athlete must
master:

  * Diet
  * Recovery
  * Mindset and psychology
  * A strong support structure
  * Event selection and specialization

<http://www.pezcyclingnews.com/latestnews/toolbox-jump-in-the-waters-great/>

These things take time and commitment to perfect. You can get “decently far”
without paying too much attention to them, but eventually, you’ll have to pay
off the debt. For growing startups, you have similar “skills”:

  * Leadership skills
  * Ability to attract and retain the best talent
  * Strong, resilient culture
  * Agility
  * Software quality and extensibility
  * Managing growing system complexity
  * Alignment and a sense of purpose
  * Product and UX savvy
  * [High customer satisfaction](https://www.saastr.com/why-i-think-saas-companies-stall-out-at-20m-arr/)

As with diet, stress management, and positive psychology, none of these things
behave in a linear fashion. You don’t get a lot of notice before the hammer
drops. When you hit that bad quarter, you won’t just be able to do first-aid.
You will spend a long time paying the price.

The alternative approach is to make these supporting skills first-class
citizens. The athlete “trains” their diet, recovery, and psychology. We extend
time horizons to ensure that the system is healthy and that they’ll be
prepared. We don’t push until we hit (and exceed) the limit, but rather creep
up on the limit paying very close attention to the warning signs.

If you’re involved in this Darwinian revenue goal game, try to assess the
fitness of your business on a deeper level. Conduct a [pre-mortem
activity](https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem) and
visualize your first crappy quarter. What happened? And what can you do about
it now? I frequently hear VCs say something like:

> Well, it’s easy to get to ___________ . Wait until they try to get from ____
to _____

The underlying assumption here is that passing these hurdles validates your
business. It may, but it doesn’t necessarily validate the full health of your
venture. The ability to right the ship will be highly constrained if you wait
for a problem to manifest. Look for those early signs!


# The Tease

Find and fix The Tease to keep your best team members

### Fix The Tease (Turning Your Org to 11)

#### Find and fix The Tease to keep your best team members

The Tease is real. And it lurks almost exclusively in some of the best
organizations.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SlxKpmInca2alYuNow606w.png)

<http://909sickle.net/hidden/somethings-not-right>

Imagine you are so close to something great. You’ve got all of the raw
materials: the talent, the drive, and the passion. It’s right there for you to
grab. Just reach for it!

Your organization is saying all the right things. You are empowered. The
cultural manifesto is in place. People use words like “servant leadership”,
“autonomy”, “cross-functional teams”, “experiment-friendly”, and “safe to
fail”. By all measures your company “gets it”. Just reach for it!

Imagine a single black sunflower in a bed of yellow sunflowers. Or a trickle
of sewage into a pristine mountain stream. Or the person having a loud cell-
phone conversation on a quiet bus. You notice. It grates on you. In another
setting, it would be normal. But here it isn’t.

This is **The Tease**. The Tease is when you’re so close to something awesome.
All the pieces are in place. But there is a trickle of suck. There’s some
dissonance, incongruity, or poison lurking. Not enough to head for the hills,
but just enough for it to linger in the collective organizational
consciousness. It’s the dab of politics, silos, favoritism, dysfunction, or
accepted bad behavior. The fact that the organization is so excellent
otherwise causes the sting.

Somehow “everywhere has problems” is no solace. You’re a victim of your
considerable efforts elsewhere. By making 99% of things awesome, and letting
that 1% suck, you let that 1% get magnified. It’s the loud wedding guest
interrupting the nuptials at an awesome wedding. That’s what people remember …

You attract the best and the best notice The Tease. **Find and fix The
Teas**e. It won’t be easy — the fact that it persists inside an awesome
organization is the testament to its power — but you must fix it to retain
your best talent.

How do you identify The Tease? Just listen for it … you’ve probably already
heard about it. Better yet, figure out why your organization can’t “self
repair” to fix The Tease. Remove that blocker, and the rest will happen
naturally.


# Pain, Potential, and Outcomes

Eat healthy! Get in shape! All your data in one place! Faster time to market!
Stop the information overload! Uptime! Speed! Less busywork…

* * *

### Pain, Potential, and Outcomes

Eat healthy! Get in shape! All your data in one place! Faster time to market!
Stop the information overload! Uptime! Speed! Less busywork! Happier
customers! Lower churn! More with less! More revenue! Lower costs!

Can you relate? Sure. Are there thousands (maybe tens of thousands) of
startups trying to solve those pains? Yes.

It all starts with **pain** (latent, expressed, or otherwise). You won’t get
things into 2nd gear unless someone cares. And then **potential**. What you
have — your product or service — has to at least hint at the possibility of
solving that pain. And finally, an **outcome**. The product _uniquely,
affordably, and gracefully_ alleviates your pain. There’s return on
investment.

It doesn’t always go as planned.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*GJzOsXVzrYmWqw56dv19Mw.png)

  * Example. I want clean water. I don’t want crap in my water. **Pain!**
  * My goodness, the Brita water filter looks amazingly clear, crisp, and pure. **Potential!**
  * Damn, they never told me about these filters, and the charcoal, and how I’m a lazy person who can’t be bothered to clean the thing, or remember to buy the filters. **Outcome? No.**

The temptation when validating your startup is to stop at **Pain and
Potential**. Pain and potential can get you pretty far when prospects are
looking for an edge. It can feel exhilarating. You can grow quickly on pain
and potential. A pain with an alluring product offering can attract a broad
cross-section of people, especially if you’ve got a good sales team.

But at the end of the day, it’ll be the competitor that produces **Outcomes**
(and keeps costs in line with the degree of differentiation) that will win the
day. You absolutely must know whether the potential promised in your product
is delivering an outcome. I always say…

> Sales and marketing sell the pain and the potential. Product delivers on
that promise

You could broadly divide up “sales driven” and “product driven” startups by
how they approach this sequence:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*jcSUWmFgThuDbmvT9nEl9g.png)

The sales driven startup puts energy behind selling the pain and potential.
**Growth** is the first objective. After going broad and taking stock of
customer outcomes, they’ll attempt to **Focus**.

The product driven startup validates **Outcomes** first, **Focuses** based on
those learnings, and then attempts **Growth**.

The bootstrapped startup has to achieve some level of profitability early to
keep the lights on, then must chase **Outcomes** to validate their offering as
quickly as possible, and then move on to **Focus** based on that knowledge and
**Grow**.

Regardless of the approach, you’ll need to consider outcomes eventually.

Does your product _uniquely, affordably, and gracefully_ alleviates the
customer pain? Your product is not a list of features. It’s a vehicle to
create outcomes.

Feature bullets sell the product. Your product delivers the outcomes.

### Beat the Feature Factory: Run Pre-cap Design Studios

**_Recommendation:_**_ Commit to a future recap of your product development initiative, and design the slides early in the process (leaving placeholders for the actual data)_

**_Benefit:_**_ Promote a learning mindset. Balance upfront planning with unbiased retrospective. Crease a sense of team ownership and pride. Drive a shared understanding of the initiative. Promote evidence driven development, even when the current strategy is more tilted towards the “feature factory”._

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WoqIdA9nbo-ewIdrQsB-5w.png)

### The Opportunity

I’ve always enjoyed exercises like
[premortems](http://quickbase.intuit.com/blog/make-better-decisions-by-
conducting-pre-mortems), [future backwards](http://cognitive-edge.com/methods
/the-future-backwards/), and [heaven and
hell](http://blog.agilar.org/2015/05/07/retrospectives-series-heaven-and-
hell/). These activities are great for exploring potential futures for an
initiative, and using that information to guide the plan and approach. I was
conducting a pre-mortem recently, and a senior engineer said something that
hit me like a brick:

> You know… when this is “done”, we will have moved on to the next thing. Sure
we will have shipped something, but it will be anyone’s guess whether this
actually worked. When do we answer that question? It just never seems to
happen.

I thought about this for a while. She was right.

We had done a half-dozen activities exploring catastrophic outcomes, heavenly
future states, problem definition, problem exploration, and possible
solutions. There was a “great deck” with an inspiring vision and lots of broad
context. But the reality was that her team would be cycled on to new efforts
before they had a chance to validate the expected impact. It was the epitome
of upfront planning — not adaptive planning — and that sucked.

**Those activities are great, but they are still front-loaded**. I tentatively offered the following thought exercise:

> It is three months after shipping. You may have moved on to something else,
but you’re eager to figure out if this worked and that it drove the expected
results. It’s nagging you. You’re curious. You schedule a talk to the whole
engineering team (100+ individuals) to share your learnings. What do you
present?

I figured an intermediate step would be simply committing to compare the
expected outcome to the actual outcome.

Something about this proposal clicked with the team. It had the effect of
putting a stake in the ground. It was a commitment to learning, and presenting
those learnings in public…not just when and if someone had time to “pull the
numbers”. Summary: it worked. The approach caught on and upped the whole
team’s game.

### General Outline

Below I’ve provided a basic outline for the presentation. It’s nothing fancy,
but you’d be amazed at how infrequently these types of presentations happen
unless there’s a major win to promote. Learnings are rarely celebrated, and
that is a shame.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yHhLGZaYQBk4p9cLvhzciA.png)

### Tips:

  * Get executive buy-in for the retrospective, and schedule it early. Part of what makes this work is the excitement (and pressure) of presenting to the whole team
  * Use a [design studio](http://www.bigspaceship.com/design-studio/) approach to “design” the slides. This alone is a great exercise for driving a shared understanding of the problem to solve. Whenever possible do it with the whole team
  * Use actual numbers whenever possible, but don’t be afraid to tell good stories
  * You might need to arrange a data-foraging exercise to pull this together, but it won’t be in vain. Self-promotion alert … [you might consider Pendo](http://www.pendo.io/) (my current product) which makes it easy to pull retroactive data without manual tagging and instrumentation.
  * Iterate on the deck while the effort is in progress, but don’t rewrite history. What makes these presentations awesome is the narrative. It sets a great example for the team.
  * Encourage the team to present as a group. It will be more impactful that way

### Conclusion

Let me know how this works for you! In my experience, visual brainstorming
works. Light peer pressure works. And face-to-face sharing inspires. Give it a
try and feel free to ask any questions in the comments below.

### Complexity Is a Startup Killer. Don’t Grow Up

Complexity is a startup killer. Like a giant anchor, it slows you down until
you’ve lost the only two advantages a startup will have: speed and focus.

Complexity manifests when you target multiple [jobs-to-be-
done](https://jtbd.info/), [elephant hunt](https://bothsidesofthetable.com
/most-startups-should-be-deer-hunters-7fdecf58f4f6#.4h29ypz1l), scale up, hire
quickly, cut corners, and implement too many “good ideas” (which seem to ooze
from every pore). The impact is exponential as you add more fuel (people,
experienced people in particular) to the fire. Before you know it, no one
knows what’s going on.

We’re not talking an [autonomous ant
colony](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/7677/20140530/ants-have-a-more-
complex-network-than-google.htm) here. Nor are we talking about a Company like
Spotify or Intuit with its dozens of pod-like
[squads](https://rctom.hbs.org/submission/the-spotify-squad-how-to-
successfully-lead-a-global-organization-without-an-operations-team/), guilds,
and colleges. When you’re further along in your business — or have evolved
since the mid-Cretaceous period — you can start to divide and conquer. With a
startup, you are none of those things. You’re still building, measuring, and
learning. Anything that constrains that is an antipattern.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*APtw_dKk8MnCwvF_ZIZh0w.png)

**Brazil **(1985) — Director: Terry Gilliam

The problem here is that complexity is incredibly tempting to add! Let
features reproduce. Get the contract management tool. Scale up sales. Close
the deal. Pitch the next product enhancement. Add more people to your board.
Find partnerships. Say Yes. Hire “experienced” people (in quotes because
Company experience doesn’t equate to Startup experience). We’re eager, and
there are a full 24hrs in the day. And you’ve always got those “good ideas”…

In creeps the complexity like a thick fog over the Sunset District. But the
fog almost never clears. Once you’ve gone down the rabbit hole, it is nearly
impossible to come back up for air.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*e-iEixNUrJrQk86V9msGvg.png)

<http://sfcitizen.com/blog/2015/02/16/ah-the-sunset-district-home-of-chain-
stores-unreliable-transit-and-oppressive-fog/>

Startups always flirt with a chaotic, existential breakdown. You’re on the
precipice, even if you don’t know it. Complexity is a safety blanket. It feels
and smells like momentum. The opposite — keeping it raw and focused — is scary
as shit. And it looks nothing like Company work.

But you NEED to fight to resist complexity, even if it freaks you out. Not in
the problem space — for sure, chase after complex challenges — but in the
execution and organizational space. Keep things so small, nimble, and simple
that it causes you near term pain (imagine you’re smelling your favorite dish
in the world and have to walk away). Don’t be a mini version of a Company.
You’ll have plenty of time to grow up.

# Startups: Be Awesome At Something

Quick post to get back in the swing of things after a much needed vacation.

### Startups: Be Awesome At Something

Quick post to get back in the swing of things after a much needed vacation.

When I talk to startup product development teams, I listen carefully for
people saying things like:

  * We’re real __________________ nerds
  * We are experts at __________________
  * We live and breath __________________
  * Our team’s secret weapon is __________________
  * We consistently find a way to __________________
  * At the core, we’re here today because __________________

If I hear people provide specific, non-plastic responses, my ears perk up.

Luck, first-mover advantage, funding, and connections can get you pretty far.
But to win (and continue winning) you need to be awesome at _something. _That
something can be a variety of things—networking, raising money,
technical/ux/product chops, knowledge of a certain buyer pain, marketing
creativity, etc. — but it **needs to be repeatable and intentional.**

Startups often fall into these traps:

  * They’re **scattered**: they want_ _to be awesome at everything
  * They’re **conflicted**: they try to be awesome at things which are in direct opposition
  * They’re **delusional**: they make bold, aspirational claims about things that they aren’t, frankly, awesome at
  * They’re **myopic**: they make big bets on being awesome at things that don’t really matter, and don’t give them an edge
  * They’re **self-conscious**: they don’t want to admit what they’re actually good at because it isn’t sexy, “cutting edge”, etc.

These traps lead you down a slippery slope: ignoring and failing to double
down on what you’re actually good at and failing to become awesome at what you
need to be awesome at.

So, take a moment to answer:

What must we be awesome at?

What are we awesome at?


# 10 Things I Learned By Doodling For 100 Days Straight

I recently finished a 100 day doodle challenge. How did it go?

### 10 Things I Learned By Doodling For 100 Days Straight

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*7ocOOfbnr1J8vMTQTWUL5w.jpeg)

I recently finished a 100 day doodle challenge. How did it go?

### The Rules

I set a small number of rules.

  * One drawing a day for 100 consecutive days. No skipping
  * Share the drawing on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cutlegram/) and Facebook
  * No erasing, start-overs, tear-outs, whiteout
  * Don’t overthink. Start drawing within 60 seconds of opening pad
  * Black and red pen
  * In one sitting

### What I learned …

  1. I spent 100hrs+ “meditating” with a pen. That’s a win. No screens! No typing! No devices! The careful line-work in particular was very calming
  2. Overall my mood and outlook improved
  3. Peer pressure works! Once my friends started chiming in on Facebook I wasn’t turning back. On a couple occasions my challenge inspired others to take the plunge. That was very rewarding and inspiring
  4. The workweek saps your creative energy. It’s hard to focus when you’re stressed. Stress would increase as the week progressed, and the drawings would become increasingly scattered. On Saturday, the relaxation kicked in. I kept thinking … what would it take to make every day like Saturday? And was my work suffering from the same lack of lateral thinking?
  5. Ritual matters. 90% of my drawings were completed at the same coffee place (Raleigh Raw), drinking the same coffee (bullet coffee with grass-fed butter), and having the same smoothie (blueberry). It took 10 days or so to get in the swing of things. And maybe 30 to make it a habit. I’m pretty sure the caffeine injection / timing played some part in this
  6. Tools inspire. Having a good set of pens and a pen bag was a big part of the experience. I have a pen fetish now
  7. It takes practice to turn off your inner critic. Social sharing boosts the need to “make it cool”. Some of the best drawings started with no censorship and forethought. I had to consciously block out the inevitable share and looking for likes and comments.
  8. When you do something every day, it’s ok if it sucks! You have another shot. If it’s your only shot, you’re more prone to freak yourself out
  9. Some days you’ll want to get serious and meaningful. Other days you’ll shoot for trite and flippant. That’s ok! When you have output, you wait patiently for the “good ones”
  10. Constraints help. Limiting myself to mostly black pen let me practice and explore what was possible

### The Drawings (In Order)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*B--5H0shvLDpBgP4fIMsig.jpeg)

**1:100** This wasn’t too much of a stretch. I draw mind-maps all day. So it was no surprise that I started off in familiar territory.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZG0aC2GMPkGHYmFtg2jTkA.jpeg)

**2: 100** He sure looks scared. And of course there’s the wing-suit which must be a reference to one of my favorite films …. [Brazil](http://cinearchive.org/post/37275277565/behind-the-scenes-of-brazil-rob-heddens). Tiny dots make their first appearance, but overall I haven’t found my groove yet.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Fc_I68qYbqPbhf22ZW1t9A.jpeg)

**3:100** Adele! Hello it’s me. Themes of isolation, rain, birds, flying, and tall places predominate. Plus I’m still using words.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HJF8yfYrqq9yiC6nWaoHfw.jpeg)

**4:100** What a smarty pants! Actually, this did start with me imagining the sensation of a rose petals on my eyeballs. This one made me happy. And it was deliberate to some degree so it didn’t feel completely accidental.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JtxUeP5T0WLB6zYUemXoag.jpeg)

**5:100** Wordplay continues. I was high from the rose colored glasses, so I took another shot at something witty. At this point I was all in. I had shared the drawings on Facebook. Game on. But it didn’t have the zing of the glasses.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uaynzIDmsINU9fAEI6i5lA.jpeg)

**6:100** Major discovery! Starbucks can completely **** me up. My hands were shaking and it felt like lasers were shooting out of my eyeballs. So I drew that.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*if4HcX4e4c79a7ZEWsJx3w.jpeg)

**7:100 **OK. Things get serious. I remember what NYC looked like shortly after 9/11. I remember all the posters taped up on construction site walls. It was heart breaking. But I have to admit … I questioned whether I was just milking this memory for the drawing. Have you ever had that happen?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9TxcsuqWNbEfLoskjJ1K2Q.jpeg)

**8:100 **My first of the the weird “the people are kind of small and the object is super big” drawings. I also discovered how to draw sand. The father and son walking away held some significance for me. This was the first drawing where I stated to get super anal with the line-work.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mbnXWajVyFjcprnP6FTRCg.jpeg)

**9:100** Strange how this happens. Back to back small people (see 8:100). This started as an insect, but I wasn’t happy with it. It didn’t look “right”. So at the last minute I turned it into a kite. I was traveling at the time, so I was likely caffeinated with Starbucks coffee (bad ideas), and my head wasn’t in the game.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*d7nkFjknbDDZUiZXsKHuDQ.jpeg)

**10:100** OK! Now we’re in business. The addiction with line-work, different textures, rain clouds, and awkward perspective gazebos begins. I actually finished this at an Agile conference in King of Prussia (of all places). My mind must have been pretty dialed in. I start to notice the fetish of carrying around nice pens.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9ZT_5IDV8_wf5WMhEd0iyA.jpeg)

**11:100** Travel day. This felt like weak sauce. It can be hard to string together super-anal line-work on back to back days.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*B40m54uvwHS3pz32gsZ_7A.jpeg)

**12:100** Strange swirls and flourishes rise! This was one of those wandering “I won’t know until it is almost done” doodles. I go to my old standby little-people (see above) and it comes to life. I loved the idea of a strange ferris / hamster wheel. The buttocks in the lower left was unintentional.

**13:100 **13 was not lucky to me. I get lost in the swirls. This was probably a stressful day.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HzeiApIAees2Y1OKmwjNJA.jpeg)

**14:100** Birds! Rain! Sand! Themes unite. My favorite part of this drawing was doing the clouds. I didn’t expect it to work. But in retrospect they look very layered and humid.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6ARbbymz7rHpNlcheuAnLQ.jpeg)

**15:100** I patted myself on the back a bunch of times for this one. Anal line-work? Check. Word-play? Check. My friend Tim counted them to make sure I did include 50 shades. I did. Pulling this off made my day. I haven’t seen the movie. Is it good?

**16:100** Return of the crazy gazebo and little people. There’s some movement here … they’re climbing to the top. What’s at the top? I don’t know. Remember the rocks. I come back to them near the end.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*X2yZEC2corhF1L7NuiwG0w.jpeg)

**17:100** Stressful morning. I couldn’t get my head in the game here, and work was looming on my mind. Stress muffles the thoughts and saps the patience.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*33Tjjo3ZDwnAn6af5RLN6Q.jpeg)

**18:100** Regaining some momentum I tap into my childhood obsession with catfish. I considered the return to halfway focused and inspired drawing a win here (given the previous day’s doodle crap).

**19:100** Is it a house? A hotel? How about a weird house with stairs? You can see the lines become tighter here. Dots. A wild freeform splat. These themes will return in future drawings.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vUAuOSIG_7xxAHkKG1fuiA.jpeg)

**20:100** And now for something completely different! I was getting bored with the semi-literal stuff. The idea of parallel lines seemed appealing.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xVJv7ys8XoLiAr2sUJ3e6g.jpeg)

**21:100** I channel a bracelet designer and go for symmetry.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*e8CyYxepDYqpg21E2Dtz5Q.jpeg)

**22:100** This followed the pattern of “ok, let’s draw a bunch of patterns and then position a person in the drawing”. Webs, roses, thorns. Some familiar themes and a more confident larger non-stick-figure.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hTxzLxXcBYcir6XZLP7xbA.jpeg)

**24:100** A crying elephant in a hall of mirrors with a nude. Makes perfect sense. I came to the elephant about halfway through the doodle.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*j-eKs6lCL-vO5_yt3S-QEQ.jpeg)

**25:100** A lapse. My mind wasn’t in it and work was piling up the stress. I try to resurrect it a couple ways, but it will be the flying steak forever.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*85ZHhYr_71q417334KVD8w.jpeg)

**26:100** Patterns and doodles. Some new techniques … little circles, network drawings, a stray bra, and booze.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FRRsFge9RL7Pe_XylHTjbQ.jpeg)

**27:100** More structure and control. For a while I was thinking about making it a woman’s back. Maybe it is. But I resort to a small man on a bicycle underneath a bunch of balloons.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0YBx6oibaOvmVXdkJBhL2g.jpeg)

**28:100** End of the workweek! Can’t hold it together. Fridays aren’t great doodle days. Note that I repeated #27. This is #28.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xclfDW286NMtb7OF0DPgoA.jpeg)

**29:100** Ah! Saturdays. Time to be incredibly detailed. The steps descend.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kn8TCRXX1cjedaj1OxHa-Q.jpeg)

**30:100** First of the knife drawings. And sexual fruit.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sj6hF85F5GbGUMSMIJbMBg.jpeg)

**31:100** Must be a Monday. Semi-relaxed but mind buzzing. The squares return in a tree drawing later.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_ZglrrcF4o-kswK-FInAHw.jpeg)

**32:100** This was more playful with larger circles. On some level it is related to the prior day’s drawing, but I go big.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*CmoSA9fYoE5igR-5SK9R-g.jpeg)

**33:100** Intriguing. I was thinking about turning 41 years old apparently.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FsejIeXQCy2_IyIiJhrJ_A.jpeg)

**34:100** More knives, fruit, and sex. Replete with a bra and a serpent. What was going on?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wzuXfCFbQh-Vci_mQdcRkg.jpeg)

**35:100** I return to the blocky tree (see 11:100), and scaling extremes (little house or person). But there’s a balance here I like.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ODZZK5IoA2dw6h8aDASpHA.jpeg)

**36:100** And now for a different tree! This was a good recovery from the prior day. Weekend work for sure.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aWnQ8JCLI_9ZCVVHQr_V-w.jpeg)

**37:100 **Robot insect. With crown (or something). I return to this a bit later.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_pnz4VGV0fyTBcnxgtRR1A.jpeg)

**38:100** I really loved this. The bullet coffee actually works. I was in the zone for a while. It was like meditating. I discovered that messy dot work can be effective for contouring things.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MQ9gAMf7bNnuuv6N4zJsSQ.jpeg)

**39:100** And I lose it! After the joy of the prior day’s work — probably early in the work week — I lose focus. The fish is nice though.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XYFy7IsaH7KXMOHojboFHA.jpeg)

**40:100** Light nudity. Lizards. Bikes. Excel cell references. Octopus. Just another day I guess. This fits in the “lots of boxes / circles with little things mixed in” theme.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NTI-xlR6fwLdzJ8FhbK4bQ.jpeg)

**41:100** This was the first of the “matchstick” type drawings.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qeb2EGTE_tZZUGjp7mGfBw.jpeg)

**42:100** And … with the Cat Save! When in doubt make it a monitor and include a cat. Totally makes sense.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0I5hFAlYw7Qbi_lmjvZ1Sg.jpeg)

**43:100** I was looking at Weather Underground and noticed the wind markers. That seemed like a cool thing to obsessively draw over and over. But I wanted to take a risk … on something “Real”. So I drew an arm and didn’t destroy it. See later for the Sperm Tree. I avoided that effect here.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-NdJI9xno_wRLsZg-CGeGw.jpeg)

**44:100** Color by numbers?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OqxTSqjVUxn7n3Uni2AUJA.jpeg)

**45:100** Bolstered by my confidence drawing “people”, I tried to sprinkle some people in. Like Nigel Tufnell. And boys. But I’m most proud of the globs on globs.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IUw7EDXhnnzGs81oKGwL6g.jpeg)

**46:100** Self-portrait. I was in a pretty angst mood that day. I was coming up with a ton of ideas … but all the ideas freaked me out.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fYJ0j7LAGJW_iY2sUbMjBQ.jpeg)

**47:100** And the hill slopes up to the right! There are birds and rocks. And patterns. And network drawings. Some classic themes with good line-work.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WnMu9CrUquS6sWHSUcyFBQ.jpeg)

**48:100** Why don’t we keep on this network drawing kick? Sure! It even looks like an animal. See later for the nude with tiny networks.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6kIqGpTnj456a6-tiy_2-A.jpeg)

**49:100** Weird hotel on a hill. Knives. Patterns!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9JSDGbvnWJccYcoZpMAo-Q.jpeg)

**50:100** Bolstered by my new pen purchases, I go completely ape-shit. There’s blood. And bones. And feathers.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hAAJSlEdALNl30mnNFAr-Q.jpeg)

**51:100** These pens are great. Seriously, good tools — and having 50 drawings under my belt — made this a ton of fun. The dots, crosshatch, etc.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*p6-feDn9O-jFRqK9uo_EgA.jpeg)

**52:100** I go deep. This started as a network drawing. Incredibly detailed. But it started to take the form of a woman. I was excited. Did the red mess it up?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qorGMgXldyaggnSUZDp3uA.jpeg)

**53:100** Maybe it is fatigue, but I return to something less arduous. I’m pretty sure this was a Monday. After the weekend of new pens and meditation, I go for something less busy.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Twsz3o5dQvg8kJX7W3BgGg.jpeg)

**54:100** As strange as it sounds, the “messy” branches on the upper left were a major win for me. I was really in the line-mode, and broke out of it with some happiness-producing results.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EjVTft8sKIwPA9RtmIl0Ug.jpeg)

**55:100 **Tunnels? More and more lines, but the “fuzziness” on the tubing was pleasing. It felt less linear.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*L0hj9FLKZltqAMLSfc63hg.jpeg)

**56:100** Black Lives Matter news. I kept thinking about a person trying to scream, but nothing coming out.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OgPgCHDaR00SJGdHJ6Jp_Q.jpeg)

**57:100** And then follow that up with a completely unrelated sperm tree. I really didn’t want this to be the sperm tree. I doodled and doodled, and kept hoping it wouldn’t look like a sperm tree. But it ended up that way.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0MgbgKBU_BDn-AjqNSgSZQ.jpeg)

**58:100** Shit! That was super lucky. A whale! A real whale. Once the form took shape, I found it hard to turn back. I learned with this drawing that you could also use light pen pressure for the line work. It was more like shading.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*No4jdMvKHrs7CzSMZzxmXw.jpeg)

**59:100** Weekday distraction. Oh well, it must be a vein. Let’s draw arrows to show the disease creeping in.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rL1Pym_MCEk0bw0YkIFdUQ.jpeg)

**60:100** Feeling toxic. Like only bullshit is leaving my mouth! Self-portrait again.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FjImOU3csUVvfNQ-K9QvvA.jpeg)

**61:100 **One of those days!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*duN7Eu6qaBRY1RuX19VAAQ.jpeg)

**62:100** Thicker lines. Petals. Layers. A good reprieve from the day before.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1GoYDwQThgPDw6xSKhTkNA.jpeg)

**63:100** And we’re back to little gazebos and walkways. Phew.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Womarhf97Le9lJhPJYtc0A.jpeg)

**64:100** Lest we forget trees, little people, fruit, and all of that good stuff.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Kns4FvCapcvkuhLRI2cnGQ.jpeg)

**65:100** Today let’s draw a ton of squares! So I did. There was something challenging about drawing little squares, and not circles.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TxVSz4T31PIcl8kT1X_9Pg.jpeg)

**66:100** Let’s get angular! And draw lines. This is an oft repeated theme, but I went full screen for this picture.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hpnaG-YVg5O_O3FkcfdjVA.jpeg)

**67:100** Non-distinct. Mid week. I finished this at 11:30PM.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZoxgRwrwl36UzX4TJtTt1w.jpeg)

**68:100** Little critters! In retrospect I didn’t like the fact that the critters were trapped by the tree. Looks uncomfortable.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*S_CQfZZ-V_tJqYUVQBhiDg.jpeg)

**69:100** No guilt! There was a creative malfunction here. So instead of just phoning it in, I called it out.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*frVMKtBXtfYiSLBw77ixXA.jpeg)

**70:100** … a hill, up and to the right. Thorns. Apparently (see upper left) I had some to-dos on my mind. This is a facsimile of some earlier drawings (blog rocks).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sbhYRa14gRlojQ5CmyY9eA.jpeg)

**71:100** Hurray for the weekend! Calm. Serenity. A tiny person, rain, and a tree. But seriously, I enjoyed the layering of the clouds on this one, and the obsessive square drawing. Win! Confidence regained.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KUfzjv4khOaiuTwwfUYHzQ.jpeg)

**72:100** Flexible fly swatters with arms. Of course!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Xzth3NI-ZfSpPHuf5ORnBA.jpeg)

**73:100** Back to wordplay. Visited friends in LA. The sun. The West Coast cool. Pulled this off in the LAX lounge over beers, but that’s what you can do when you’re sketching and not drawing lines furiously.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xbLE-qUA29onYOmpp6gGrg.jpeg)

**74:100** Look at this thick pen. Patterns! Jet lagged to be honest.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pi8Cfowh2RiIm9w53J_fgg.jpeg)

**75:100** This makes me angry, actually. It feels very phoned-in. Oh hey, let’s draw a human cat with triangle hair. Nothing feels right about it.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XgR-e7e8usQuXCwmdM3B6Q.jpeg)

**76:100** More distraction. Saving grace is the swimming pool.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1_5Dho6PmBE-HWxz0dpWkA.jpeg)

**77:100** And then faith is restored! Back to some flower-work. Tight lines. Petals. Good recovery.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HVCU_VzNaTJ40fUxKrGrtQ.jpeg)

**78:100** I’m not stopping there! Let’s get the line ON! I was calm, caffeinated with good coffee, and ready to experiment (like with the fuzzy bird head). Guess what? It’s a Saturday! Maybe this is the living version of the bird in **50:100**.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Dho4S7hV4kaR72JMEtFEDw.jpeg)

**79:100** And on Sunday I slow down a bit. Softer lines. Post bike ride. Some sinew.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*R9y-_RcWBoWBAsQwWwz0CQ.jpeg)

**80:100** **** this. I am going to draw Monday a bunch of times. Over and over.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*na35kISSfSR1W7Aj70dtNA.jpeg)

**81:100** Good recovery for a Tuesday. Not great. But not totally annoying.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TD8xOsPqfeKpb1HPMbg-Pw.jpeg)

**82:100 **I love great pens. They make Wednesday awesome.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*i7_jTUsnPgIp6SuIcyUTyA.jpeg)

**83:100** And this is what a Thursday feels like. Scribble scribble.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EHRqvy5Zm27pn-7dc-rfhg.jpeg)

**84:100** Keep pushing through. You can always fall back on matchsticks, connective lines, quasi-harps, and dark line bursts.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yTuZF3p4i8wYtKZbSx-BIw.jpeg)

**85:100** One continuous line. This one felt like I was just floating along. It probably took a couple hours but I was enjoying my coffee too much. Intestines?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*P9Rn1sOAv50NHo7iRREWEA.jpeg)

**86:100** Down the rabbit (intestine) hole.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*D8RaV1YSE0tG6vfgb_GH5Q.jpeg)

**87:100** The old bird and talon standby. Blood!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RzkjfWqBrBWcoAUQIJclcw.jpeg)

**88:100** Remember that robot? 37:100. A gentler robot, with a bearded Grecian head. Makes perfect sense.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_hBJxUtss9QugJpgT4FQTg.jpeg)

**89:100** Waaaay different! I set out here to challenge myself with non-lines. This might have been mid-week as well, but the project suited the freneticism of the workweek.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*P08nzZ85KgXWuNaUPPO9Qg.jpeg)

**90:100** Completely Kosher. No innuendo at all. It’s a flower.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eit3k52tfH9jJeetHLTkQA.jpeg)

**91:100** The solid branches were a change here. It felt swampy and drippy.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*d9_VBkmr3h_4JdoyAluVXA.jpeg)

**92:100** The goat! This was a serious effort. I worked hard on the line-work. It started to take the shape of these aggressive rocks. It might seem stereotypical — Mountain Goat — but the idea of this goal being challenged by this maze of rocks was appealing.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*iuatYaBi8A3sQq77IbiX7w.jpeg)

**93:100** Another hotel on a barren landscape. With two crystal balls for eyes. it is almost insect-like, and I was probably shooting for that initially.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jAR3rAycCl43bwBr93WNZg.jpeg)

**94:100** This took on a fishy / kelpy vibe kind of early. But it wasn’t until I committed 100% to the scales that it took shape.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*loKUPzl9h2hLBAkFLhjBhw.jpeg)

**95:100** When in doubt … wait until 11:30PM when you’re fried from work and draw a tree.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0fmF3hsgA5slrGcUKfZc2Q.jpeg)

**96:100** Nice and simple and bursty!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YLkkcjmywS3-4UDCChGH1Q.jpeg)

**97:100** If you’re a child of divorce (or don’t have kids and use Facebook) you know that feeling of seeing happy families together through a haze/static.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Z7S1CDR5J3_RZHKms32xaw.jpeg)

**98:100** Life takes you on twists and turns sometimes.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*arwaJ1RUYgoUyHe1i3scQA.jpeg)

**99:100** First full day in Greece on Vacation! I was super proud of the ink-painting on this one. It took a couple hours. But it captured my sense of calm and contemplation.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Ow5XL-IHD070YAbwU44SiA.jpeg)

100:100 What’s next? Who knows!


# Agile: Don’t Exchange Waterfalls for Whirlpools

This is a waterfall:

### Agile: Don’t Exchange Waterfalls for Whirlpools

This is a **waterfall**:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gD-WKbjHO5xMrfxmnUz4pQ.png)

In the Agile product development world, waterfalls are **bad**. The idea was
to get away from things that look like **this**:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5W0GLhXeSlHADiINxAABdQ.png)

… and move to something that looks more like ocean waves:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eo0RvfGL37fEJcHvowifRg.png)

<http://scrumreferencecard.com/scrum-reference-card/>

It actually works. Faster! Better! More flexible! Less rework! Less waste!
What’s not to like? The business will change its mind all the time (those
crazy suits) and you’ll just do some Agile kungfu on it. Scrum CHOP!

The problem is that Agile (as commonly implemented) often feels like a
whirlpool. Without tending to the human side — diversity, safety, and
celebrating meaningful results — it becomes a treadmill. It’s a constant slog
of monotonous rituals and meandering iterative development… like adding globs
of wet sand to a sand sculpture at the beach. ‘Round and ‘round you go …
introspecting in a hall of retrospective mirrors:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1VGTPTZOeBtA77_s5Av7sA.png)

Retros. Planning. Backlog grooming. Acceptance criteria. Standup. Rinse
repeat.

Without a focus on outcomes and results, you’re stuck on a feature factory
treadmill. And you know what? Experienced people hate that. Crap made fast is
still crap. They check out. Once you’ve graduated out of the pure bliss of
releasing production-ready code, you start to wonder if anyone is using these
“stories”. Is it working? Did you [eventually build the
car](http://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp) …

<http://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp>

… or are you stuck in a perpetual MVP exercise wondering when the “business”
will figure things out?

Have you checked out the This American Life episode on the GM Nummi plant? If
not, do so [here](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-
archives/episode/561/nummi-2015). What I found most interesting about this
story is that GM couldn’t replicate the Nummi success in other plants. The
original team — faced with an impending plant closure — visited Japan and had
a transformative experience. They were empowered to save their plant and
experienced amazing success. In other plants, that wasn’t the case. Those
efforts failed.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Ey03KtTIkoakcJhoW_iNmA.png)

> Before, when GM ran this place, I dreaded coming to the plant. Management
was always screaming and hollering. Now it is so different! I look forward to
getting here and helping my team solve problems.

Humans enjoy the ebb and flow! They like ambitious visions and a challenge. We
enjoy stories with a beginning, middle, and end. We like making a difference!

> [](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/741927058218098688)

There is a certain zen to iterative development …

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WQi6B0dLvZlPfslcX2zDcQ.png)

Esher Sisyphus or “Zen”?

And an almost “wax on / wax off” mystique …

> Don’t forget to breath. Very important.

But Daniel eventually goes on to compete against the brutal Cobra Kai. There’s
a story arc there.

All of that stuff you want: the scale, the growth , the speed, the quality,
the control, the accountability, the predictability, the … agility is
achievable **without safety, diversity, and learning (**at least for a short
period of time)**.** If you’re a big org and feel like some paint-by-numbers
just [implement SAFe](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NooB8547rZ7C6N6JQF6lPw.png)

To get to a higher level you’ll eventually need the empathy, inspiration,
creativity, humanity, and novelty:

> [](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/703784483934203904)

So, with that … think about ripples and impact. A powerful center, with power
rippling outwards.

# Maybe You’re Just Bored. And It’s Your Fault

It’s not the boss, the strategy, or the system. You’re just not in the right
place and/or doing the right thing. And it’s your fault.

* * *

### Maybe You’re Just Bored. And It’s Your Fault

#### It’s not the boss, the strategy, or the system. You’re just not in the
right place and/or doing the right thing. And it’s your fault.

I speak from experience.

#### Sound Familiar?

I’m 41. I like big challenges, missions, and asking why. I get bored easily
when I can’t tackle those things.

I like rigor. I work hard and my work is considered valuable and high
leverage. I don’t navigate internal politics well. I tease out of the root
cause quickly. I want to fix those problems. I’ve been called the “canary in
the coal-mine” multiple times. I’m impatient, stubborn, and lack tact. I
relate to the front-line doers and like flat organizations. I believe most
managers are just getting in the way.

That’s me, for better or worse.

It’s taken a while to **accept that many work situations left me bored and
under-stimulated. That was a big step. Without that self-awareness I
frequently sought stimulation by trying to fix the situation. **And we know
how that goes … established systems are a beast, you get burnt out, leave, and
it all starts over.

#### My Advice …

A friend in their mid-twenties sent me an email recently asking for advice. I
saw a lot of me in him: hunger, sensitivity, drive, confidence mixed with
insecurity, systems thinking, and the drive for a “better way”. I replied with
this …

> It’s your responsibility, and your responsibility alone, to seek out (or
create) the environments where you can thrive. Your weaknesses shape your
strengths. Without them you’d not be who you are. You could spend decades
trying to be something you aren’t, or invest the time now being who you are.

> My biggest “mistake” was not building a foundation earlier. Chipping away
earlier. Accepting earlier. I was my own worst enemy for a long time.

> Maybe you’re a better consultant! Maybe you should start a company! Maybe
you need a better mission, or a better cause! Maybe you need to hang out with
different people. Maybe people should pay you to be exactly who you are, warts
and all? Do what it takes. You might even need to shut up and do the grunt
work for a couple years (but keep the end-goal in mind).

> Most importantly, start writing your own narrative. Because it will take a
while. And wont be easy.

The next time you find yourself angst-ridden about your work … ask if you’re
just under-stimulated. Are you bored? And why are you allowing that to be the
case? How are you getting that fixed?

### Do We Need Product Managers?

#### _After reading the 745th blog post trying to define product management
and product ownership …._

Yeah. I know. It depends. But …

To build a successful product you _do need _context, business savvy, domain
knowledge, vision, customer empathy, technical prowess, communication skills,
and [insert skill/hat here]. You need lots of hats:

But you don’t necessarily need Product Managers and/or Product Owners (people
with those titles).

Businesses talk frequently about owning, single wringable necks and
accountability. Someone needs to give the status update. Someone needs the
visibility. Someone needs to be presentable enough to attend The Business
(capitalized) meetings. The Business needs these things. Do they contribute to
building a valuable product? That’s debateable. In addressing those needs,
organizations often propagate anti-patterns that cause deep, lasting harm.

At conference after conference I hear about “bad product managers” and
“incapable product owners”. I’ve heard product owner jokes in keynote talks.
I’ve participated in multiple ad-hoc 5 Why exercises with strangers that
identify product management as the root cause. Is it really that bad? I don’t
think so. It’s safe to say that something else is going on. All of these well
meaning people can’t suck so bad (although consultants would love for you to
believe otherwise).

I think that the problem is 1) the pipe-dream, and 2) structuring the org
around dysfunction. Time traveling to 2008, [here’s a description of the
product owner role](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/product-
owner):

> Part of the product owner responsibilities is to have a vision of what he or
she wishes to build, and convey that vision to the scrum team. This is key to
successfully starting any agile software development project.

> The product owner is commonly a lead user of the system or someone from
marketing, product management or anyone with a solid understanding of users,
the market place, the competition and of future trends for the domain or type
of system being developed.

Wow. That sounds awesome. This superhero will figure it all out for us, and
we’ll be off to the races. We’ll have someone to blame if there is no vision.
They’ll know what to build, and we’ll build it. So we dutifully assign these
people to 6–12 engineers, regardless of whether those 6–12 engineers build a
singular product, and hope for the best.

A CTO (who prides himself on being “Agile”) recently told me:

> Well John, you know that all engineers secretly want to be told what to
build. We like to build. We don’t want to waste our time in meetings

In addition to this being patently false — many engineers I know very much
care about impact — we know this approach fails. We know we’re wrong often. At
a minimum we know we’re rarely 100% right when we first ship something. And
time is a cruel mistress. But the pipe-dream exists.

The reality is that most product managers are overworked, spread too thin, and
under-empowered. They’re the go-between. What people recognize as “bad product
management” can almost always be traced back to deeper organizational
challenges. These challenges manifest in the connective tissue of the
organization (the product team). Product makes for a convenient scapegoat.

Every PM can relate to that awkward moment when someone with “C” in their name
is helicopter managing the product, while at the same time the team is beating
them up for changing priorities. That’s not a recipe for attracting and
retaining the best.

I often hear about the benefits of “creative tension” between the Product,
Engineering, and Sales organizations. To which I respond with something like:

> Why do you insist on silo-ing the product and engineering teams? Is
engineering just a factory in your mind? How do you actually benefit from this
tension? More importantly, what do your customers think about all of these
coordination meetings? Why not a single product development organization?

Some organizations have taken the bold step of a single product development
organization, but this is pretty rare. Toyota had the famed chief engineer
role, [a staple of the value-stream oriented lean product development
model](http://www.lean.org/shook/DisplayObject.cfm?o=906). But the reality
remains: most organizations are structured around their needs (and
dysfunctions), and not the needs of the customer. They create product roles
because “that’s what people do” instead of asking “what must we do for our
customers”. The org becomes fatter, taller, less skilled, less resilient, less
adaptable, and more complex to navigate.

You start optimizing around your company structure, and not what people
actually need.

### Probing Questions

Start by asking yourself some questions …

  1. Do your PMs own outcomes or the delivery of features? If the delivery of features, why not just hire skilled project managers?
  2. By hiring the single PM, are you failing to provide other much needed pieces of context to your teams? Are your PMs skilled at ________ ?
  3. Why does every group of 6 or 12 engineers and UX need a product owner? Is that team exclusively responsible for an actual product? If they controlled the budget would they actually hire the PO full-time? Or would they put a rec out for other, more specific needs (e.g. “attend meeting X and let us know if there are changes”)
  4. What do your teams need? What do your customers need? What % of your PM’s day is actually benefitting the customer vs. the internal needs of your organization? Why?
  5. How do your product managers insulate your engineering teams? How could you eliminate the need to “protect the teams from __________” ?
  6. Could you afford fewer, but more highly skilled product managers and product owners? Even if they had larger teams?
  7. Are there more effective ways to deliver status checks?
  8. Why do you need separate Product org and Engineering orgs? How does the customer benefit?
  9. Could you rotate the PO role? Are there other folks in the organization who can supply the context, thereby cutting out the noise / signal loss? Do your needs remain constant? If not, can your PMs/POs remain that adaptable? Or do you expect them to just bail?
  10. Are your most skilled product managers/owners working on the front lines?
  11. Are your expectations for your product team reasonable? Is there enough time in the day to actually do the work adequately?
  12. Can you bring the silos of your organization closer together? Such that the overhead of coordination would drop and benefit your customers? And what would that do to your product team?

So yeah. Sometimes you’ll end up with the someone with the Product Manager or
Product Owner title. But sometimes you wont. Before you write that job ad,
consider what you need and/or what you need to do to make that person
successful.


# Explaining Product/Market Fit in 60 Seconds

Your product shows potential. But does it perform?

* * *

### Explaining Product/Market Fit in 60 Seconds

#### Your product shows potential. But does it perform?

Product/market fit is a slippery term. I think of it as follows (3Ps):

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Q4ql8AqNvIIuGpKgDicMjw.png)

#### Pain

You’ve validated a **pain** exists and an identifiable group of people are
willing to fork over cash to see that problem fixed

#### Potential

Your product shows **potential. **That group of people want to give your
product a shot. They’re willing to engage with your product/organization in
the hopes that it will solve their pain.

#### Performance

Your product **performs**. It actually solves / alleviates the pain. It
produces valuable outcomes and _continues_ to produce valuable outcomes month
after month, year after year. You continue to innovate on your solution to the
problem/**pain**, and realize the **potential**.

This is why Product/market fit is fluid and hard to pin down, especially when
you’re tackling ubiquitous problems.

  1. **Pain **is relatively easy. Most pains are known (though some discover pains we didn’t even know we had).
  2. With some work, teams can develop products that show **potential**. It’s harder, but doable. The deeper the pain, the more people are willing to take chances on things with potential. Especially in tech, a lot of companies are throwing around money just to try things out.
  3. **Performance** is where things get tough. The rubber hits the road.

The danger is **mistaking pain and potential for performance**. Pain and
potential can get you reasonably far, certainly past a couple rounds of
funding. But it all eventually boils down to performance. Large swaths of
startup technology hasn’t advanced beyond the potential phase. Which is OK —
there might be a huge upside — but it is what it is.

The lesson: **differentiate product potential from product performance** when
talking about Product Market Fit.

### 16 Quick Product Management Tips

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RhRgIrTBI3EdGZiz6AYNRw.png)

PM work isn’t easy ….

Some quick coffee fueled snippets from a product coaching email exchange …

#### Consider the following …

  1. Approach all PM advice with some skepticism. What is the context? What is the product? What is the product stage? Who is the customer?
  2. Senior engineers care deeply about the impact of their work, and check out when they don’t sense that impact. Being a cog in a feature-factory is no fun. Address that or risk losing your best
  3. Batch your planning and approach it “just in time”. The floors of companies are littered with planning in progress. You can plan 6 months of work in 60 minutes, so why do it ahead of time?
  4. Be proactive about giving the team slack to work down debt. Let them know you’re open to that discussion
  5. There’s a spectrum of actionable context. More experience = greater ability to act on (and reject) data, context, and details. Junior folks wont have that skill (yet). Point is … respect the need for more context as it gives your best team members the information they need to solve the problem. For junior team members respect that they’re constantly upping their game. Explain how you’re connecting the dots …
  6. Leave time to iterate. This is frequently given lip service. “Well, we’ll watch for things and then — while you’re building this new widget — we’ll work it in.” This never (or rarely) happens … and 2 years later, when the context is lost, doesn’t count
  7. Cultivate a meaningful ebb and flow. Iterative development can suck the life out of a team. People like challenges and missions
  8. Respect the dynamic. Writing production-quality code and designing production-quality user experiences is extremely demanding. There are “passing tests” (usability tests included). As a PM, do you have passing tests?
  9. Become a master of driving a shared understanding. But realize that meetings are one of many ways to achieve that (and often the least effective). Visualize things. Record things. Repeat things, in person
  10. Creative work requires downtime. What defines productivity in your world (keyboard tapping) doesn’t equal productivity in the UX and Engineering world
  11. If the “best ideas win” then make sure that everyone has a fair shot at offering ideas. The reality is that your ideas aren’t always the best ideas. More importantly, cultivate a deep understanding of the problem, or commit to learn more about the problem. The good ideas will flow
  12. Quantify the status quo. Too many teams dream up success metrics with no baseline. What is the customer’s current behavior? Later, check to see if your work impacted this behavior
  13. “Leftover” work and design/research don’t work well with each other. It’s two different mindsets. Don’t do six 1hr research activities spread over a week while you tie up loose ends. Finish A, and then start B with two days of focused work. That “staggered sprint” thing or “getting ahead of the sprint” … just not a fan. All efficiencies disappear despite it making sense on paper
  14. It’s tempting to force convergence (“we need the mockups now!”). The best ideas emerge after an almost uncomfortable level of divergence. Protect this, even if it feels messy
  15. You have to be willing to throw code away and start over. As a PM its easy to rationalize otherwise.
  16. It’s important to differentiate between linear and non-linear impacts in product development. You can’t scale certain things 2x and expect other things to scale 2x (e.g. # of personas and size of team required to serve those personas)

OK. Back to coffee and [some doodling](https://medium.com/personal-

### Why Startups Need 3rd Party Accountability Coaches

As a startup founder you’ll get a lot of advice and feedback. Everyone has
opinions. Everyone wants you to avoid pitfall X,Y, and Z. Your board, your
employees, your fellow founders, and your customers will all have something to
say. The advice is often conflicting and deafening.

More advice doesn’t equal more clarity and at its worst (e.g. board advice) it
forces violent swings in strategy and tactics. What’s needed is unbiased
accountability. Is it working? Where’s the data? How are your experiments
going? Are you staying true to your values? Instead, you get shotgun blasts of
well-meaning but invariably biased advice.

The problem is compounded because founders exist in a cognitive bias petri
dish. It’s the achilles heel of the lean startup approach. A disciplined,
experimental approach sounds good in theory. But that all falls apart when
someone dangles money in your face, an investor mentions an off-handed
challenge, the big partner calls, or someone fluffs your ego.

So the advice is biased and you are biased … the well-meaning leading the
blind.

The irony is that most founders, at some point, were the one’s giving the good
advice and feedback. The rolls were reversed. And someone wasn’t listening.
That frustration, and the conviction to “not make these silly mistakes”, is at
the root of many startup inception stories. But like parents promising to
never repeat the sins of their parents, it’s much harder to pull off in
practice.

What you need, is someone with no skin in the game to hold you accountable.
Not an employee, not another founder, not someone on your board, and not a
friend in the business. Find that person. Write things down. Meet regularly.
Describe your strategy, pivot/proceed points, and milestones. Be disciplined
and focused. And get dispassionate advice linked to YOUR goals.

Thinking](http://www.thwink.org/sustain/glossary/SystemsThinking.htm)

I am eternally grateful for the great work these communities and individuals
have done. My personal ROI to learn, mix, match, and apply these methods has
been amazing. Sure it looks like a buzzword soup. But that’s what learning is
all about. “Consume responsibly! Test for staining!”

If you think its easy to do research, write a book, organize conferences, give
talks, complete projects, and [ — — — — ] you are mistaken. Sure, much of it
isn’t “new” (and the curators wouldn’t claim otherwise) but the presentation
is crisp and thoughtful. In some cases — take Lean and Agile, for example —
the body of work is massive, spanning decades and tens of thousands of people.
Sure, some people want to cash in. But don’t we all, on some level?

Put bluntly, there are no shortage of ideas and perspectives to apply to your
current challenge. Perhaps too many. It is a “learner’s market” … you’ve got a
lot to work with. However ….

In most cases, organizations are not blocked because they picked the “wrong
model”. Rather, they are blocked because their organization lacks the pre-
requisites for experimentation, reflection, and continuous improvement (a
challenge addressed in many of these approaches, though often glossed over by
the reader). Or they’re truly burdened by past decisions. There’s nothing
original in this observation. We’ve all played the old salt reminding people
that there is no magic bullet. [There’s a reason why it took years for Inuit
to adopt a design thinking approach](https://hbr.org/2015/01/intuits-ceo-on-
building-a-design-driven-company).

That said, I find myself making the same mistakes repeatedly:

  * Taking too broad of a systems thinking approach. Sometimes the problem is truly local. You’ve got a toxic, power hungry, maniacal person in a position of power. And that sucks. Granted, the fact that they remain in power is the root cause, but I digress :)
  * You can’t measure someone’s passion for change by how loud/quite they are. Some people love to complain. Others are scared to speak out. Partner and form alliances with care
  * Timing. Many orgs are digging out from a mountain of ____ debt. It manifests as having product issues, but the reality is that nothing tangibly will happen in that area until they’ve worked out other issues
  * Assuming that folks feel safe to experiment and fail. An executive sponsor may be terrified at the prospect of trying X and failing on the first go round
  * Payday. Some people are just riding things out. They’re waiting to be 100% vested. They have a lot to win and gain. It doesn’t mean they approve of what’s going on, but just that they’ve come to peace with their desired outcome
  * The power of “good enough”. Because something is working moderately well doesn’t mean that 1) it will continue to work, 2) it can be improved upon without major changes. But that is difficult to explain and sometimes very difficult to refute
  * Only the “front-line” is bought in. Most of these approaches appeal to the front lines. But that doesn’t mean anyone else is paying attention. The reverse is often the case
  * Underestimating the sheer power of the status quo. It is easy to imagine it as static, instead of respecting the powerful dynamics required to keep something “stable”

> [](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/772044832747294720)

  * Not being empathetic to “change PTSD” … namely, the prior damage of poorly thought out change initiatives done under the banner of a “way”. Lots of senior execs suffer from this, and it drives their skepticism
  * The need for people to own and take credit for improvements and change. In many cases the methodology is being “hired” to give a particular team member power and influence. And sometimes we fall into that trap ourselves. I’ve dealt with people who steadfastly resisted methodology X, and then embraced X+”UX” because they owned UX
  * Lack of shared understanding. My “customer focused” is your “UX obsessed” is their “build features to close the deal”
  * Limited CIP: change in progress. The limited capacity of any system to absorb change. It wont all happen at once
  * Believing everyone thinks and learns the same way
  * Not reflecting and retro-ing on the change effort itself. Is it working? Why? Why not?

So, when mixing and matching your favorite perspectives (or implementing your
own), remember to keep this all in mind. Work first on the operating system:
cultivating an environment friendly to experimentation, reflection, and
continuous improvement. And then go to town at a sustainable pace.


# It’s All Good. Until You’re Screwed

### It’s All Good. Until You’re Screwed

There’s no free lunch or magic strategy.

Costs and risk are frequently invisible. Effects are non-linear and difficult
to predict. What makes sense now often makes no sense in the long term. We all
struggle with our biases. The sensible response proves to be irrational.

It is never easy …

  * We destroy our goals for three quarters, but end up struggling to pick up the pieces for the next two quarters
  * We pursue growth, but end up underestimating the accumulation of technical and cultural debt
  * We prevent errors, but end up overly confident that errors will be caught
  * We celebrate healthy tension, but end up with the mediocre, but less objectionable option
  * We try to keep everyone in the loop, but end up drowning in meetings and communications
  * We carefully define roles and responsibilities, but end up with too many constraints and too heavily matrixed team members
  * We design the perfect interface, but end up incapable of extending it for a new use-case
  * We hire 10x doers, but end up in need of 10x coaches and mentors
  * We seek alignment, but end up with too much momentum and process to pivot
  * We promote autonomy, but end up incapable of mustering the troops to defend against an immediate threat
  * We promote harmony, but end up having trouble with uncomfortable conversations
  * We stress individual accountability, but end up squashing team ownership
  * We chase velocity, but end up quickly shipping mediocre outcomes
  * We bail out a team, but end up limiting their ability to self-rescue in the future
  * We target more personas with our product, but end up with feature soup
  * We defeat one competitor, but end up leaving ourselves vulnerable to disruption

And that’s life. What counts is our ability to observe and respond … to
question the rational path, experiment, reflect, and repeat. What works now,
might not work tomorrow! Ask yourself: what is restricting our ability to
change course when the course is no longer smart?

Use a light touch and resist the urge to control and predict.

Cheers!

John


# PMs/POs: 25 Things You Can Try Now

What can you do in the next week or two to be a better product manager?

* * *

### PMs/POs: 25 Things You Can Try Now

#### What can you do in the next week or two to be a better product manager?

I write these listicles for friends and consulting clients and share them when
I can:

  1. Call five customers and ask them the same, non-leading questions. Share an overview with your team. Better yet, invite folks to listen in
  2. Observe five people using your product to get their daily work done. GoToMeeting is fine for this. Ask to be a fly on the wall. Edit a set of interesting clips. Share with your team
  3. Conduct a story-mapping exercise (see [Jeff Patton’s book for help](https://www.amazon.com/User-Story-Mapping-Discover-Product/dp/1491904909/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=jefpatass-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=NX2UXYQEFAANOFPO&creativeASIN=1491904909))
  4. Collaborate with your UX team to conduct a usability test _right now _for an upcoming feature (a paper prototype is fine). Do a couple tests, iterate, and repeat
  5. Watch [this video](https://vimeo.com/167029277) from [Sian Townsend](https://medium.com/u/745c6beae85f) on jobs-to-be-done. Consider how you could use jobs-to-be-done to replace personas, roadmap items, user stories, etc.
  6. Make sure you understand exactly how your business makes money (or intends to make money). What assumptions has your company made about the fundamentals? What must remain true for you to continue with business as usual? Sketch it out, and explain it to someone who has just started at your company. If you service a specific vertical, learn exactly how your customers make money as well
  7. Take a field trip with your team (yes, a real trip, with a van, with engineers and UX) to visit a customer. Spend a couple minutes on the drive back to capture key learnings
  8. Set a couple dozen [Google Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts) for news on competitors, customers, and specific domains/markets
  9. Break down silos. Do you speak to someone without your team present? Figure out how to have a conversation together so you aren’t the blocker and/or go-between
  10. Invite customers to the office and schedule a series of activities that they can participate in (e.g. sketching, customer journey mapping, etc.)
  11. Go on site with a customer and record a no-holes-barred, “this is how you could completely change how I work”, video. Bring the inspiration back to the team
  12. Figure out how to have an honest and safe discussion with your team about what is working, and what isn’t working. All too often the presence of the PO/PM stifles conversation (you’d be amazed what they say when you aren’t around). Change that dynamic!
  13. Create a “that drives me crazy” list — things that drive your internal team crazy when they use the product — and dedicate a couple days to knock those things out. It isn’t guaranteed to be customer facing, but it sure will boost morale
  14. Institute a just-in-time meeting policy. Make a Kanban board public. Keep adding agenda items to the board until there is enough stuff to fill a 45 minute meeting. Have the meeting. There’s no sense in talking about stuff until it is actionable and pertinent
  15. Get some photos of real customers who will benefit from your immediate work, and put them up on the wall. Call them as well. Personas are great and all, but real people and real stories inspire people
  16. Organize a customer panel to discuss topics pertaining to an upcoming initiative. Invite the whole team. Seeing the differences and similarities across customers can be eye opening. Plus it’s fun
  17. Partner with your onboarding / customer success / account management team and schedule regular interviews and usability tests with new customers. Fresh eyes are super valuable
  18. Remove a rarely used feature and figure out how to message this to your customers. That wasn’t that bad, was it!?
  19. Work to break through any of the stereotypes you hold about your team (e.g. engineers don’t care about UX, and UX doesn’t care about the business). Invite someone to lunch. Ask about what drives the people you work with
  20. Before you use the words _complicated_ and _complex_, [consider this model from David Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_Framework) . Ask whether the problem you are solving is complicated or complex
  21. Conduct a targeted survey in-app. The targeting matters… you want highly qualified responses. The silent majority of users has a lot to say
  22. Check the adoption of your past five ship and reflect on your product decisions together
  23. Make a commitment to report back to your organization on the outcomes generated from your current effort. Consider [a pre-cap design studio](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/beat-the-feature-factory-run-pre-cap-design-studios-725d1c83ecd7) to flesh out what you want to communicate
  24. Schedule a session where everyone — yes everyone, including engineers — draws ideas, prototypes, etc. Make it official by calling it a [design sprint](https://developers.google.com/design-sprint/downloads/DesignSprintMethods.pdf)
  25. Do some [research on Service Design](http://www.servicedesigntools.org/) . Consider how your product is an integral part of a higher level service, and reach out to other parts of the organization to understand how you can help deliver that service more effectively. Customer journey mapping is a great place to start


# The Healthy Tension Trap

Seriously! We’re all Product Developers!

* * *

### The Healthy Tension Trap

#### Seriously! We’re all Product Developers!

I’m sure you’ve heard something like this before…

> A good designer wants an elegant, polished solution. A good PM wants to
solve the right problem and optimise for speed. A good engineer wants an
implementation that’s maintainable and efficient.
([source](https://blog.intercom.com/healthy-tension-in-product-teams/))

And then you’ll hear about _healthy tension_. The idea is that everyone will
“advocate” for their respective interests, and out will pop an awesome
product. The thinking is that without the keen eye of UX, the interface will
end up looking like a command prompt. Or that without Product cracking the
whip, Engineering will re-factor their code a dozen times, and UX will polish
every pixel (repeatedly, those wacky designers).

Do you know what happens instead (in many cases)? Mediocrity and complacency.
Green + Red != Christmas. No…. Green + Red = Brown (an “[icky mix that doesn’t
bode well for your pigment/paint](https://www.quora.com/What-color-does-green-
and-red-make)”).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rZDosDyq2H9xMr9ZB-aXwg.png)

Instead of advocating (and healthfully debating) for the **_best idea, or the
right way to deliver value to customers, _**you end up with bunch of people
playing into various stereotypes, or worse yet chasing the incentives /
rewards of their functional group over a focus on customer needs.

A **_healthy team_** will debate, argue, test, and tweak. It’ll get downright
heated sometimes. _Healthy _**_tension_**_ _assumes no one can think beyond
their functional silo, look at the data, or leverage the respective
backgrounds and skills of their teammates in a productive, non-tense way.
Someone wins, and someone loses.

Quotes [like this](http://www.zdnet.com/article/engineering-design-need-to-go-
hand-in-hand-for-enterprise-software-execs/) drive me crazy:

> “There’s some healthy tension there,” McCoy remarked. “At the end of the
day, the product manager has a primary responsibility to the business. The
designer has a primary responsibility to the user.”

The dreaded **Business** raises its ugly head again (as if there is this clean
line between the engineering org — the factory — and the business/product
folks who know what to build). Designers! Have you been in this position and
rocked that _healthy tension_? Was it fun representing that user? Did you
“win” ?

We are all product developers! We make stuff people use. We wear a ton of
hats. We care! I’m not saying you don’t have a speciality, and a community of
practitioners to learn from, but that is different from carving up your
product development organization.

No one has ever given me a persuasive reason why you can’t just bag the three
functional groups and have a single product development team.

But, but, but …. the CTO doesn’t care about UX! **Bad reason**. But, but, but
… we need a Product org to hold the Engineering org accountable. **Bad
reason**. Most of the reasons have to do with internal personalities, trust,
chains of command, and outdated ideas about how _healthy tension_ can benefit
the product development process. They’re rooted in the idea that you need this
layer (product management) to sit between the business and the engineering
factory, and that UX will sort of float there advocating for good design when
no one will listen. And that we’re all myopically selfish.

Replace tension with trust and diversity. It achieves the same outcome without
the death-by-matrix baggage.

As mentioned in previous posts, the customer doesn’t care one bit how you
structure your org. But if they witnessed the typical positioning,
politicking, and “advocating” that happens in most organizations, they’d
probably laugh. Solve my problem, so I can give you money! And leverage
everyone’s skills to make that happen, regardless of context, functional
group, or agenda.

Random stock photo from [here](http://www.onlineschoolscenter.com/30-high-
paying-trade-school-degrees/) . Sadly, without this image, I’ll have about
1/5th the number of readers.

There are [product management conferences](http://www.mindtheproduct.com/),
[UX conferences](https://www.uxstrat.com/), [software engineering
conferences](https://chefconf.chef.io/), [customer success
conferences](http://www.gainsight.com/pulse/), [Agile

bootcamps](http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/exec-ed/programs/design-thinking-boot-
camp) ($12,500 for four days). And then there are those pesky tracks (bless
the single track conferences, by the way, because I’m a track swinger).

Help me out here. I must be missing the obvious.

Barring some attempts (e.g. [LeanWX 2016](http://2016.leanuxnyc.co/about-us/)
by the LeanUX crew) and the startup focused conferences [Lean
Startup](http://leanstartup.co/2016-conference/?gclid

_product development_ conference. You know, somewhere where the people who do
the work — the people who wear the various hats — get together and talk about
how to make the magic happen. We have all sorts of opportunities to learn how
to make **OUR** magic happen, but not **THE MAGIC**.

Weary consultants have rightfully embraced organizational design as their
_last stand_. It’s HOT. It’s where the money is, and frankly it is where the
problem is as well. Either that, or the big bugaboo scaling. Whole-org
Agility. Lean Startup for the Enterprise. Complexity Theory. The Learning
Organization. Teal Orgs (what a color pick). **Still…where do those of us in
the trenches take off our respective hats and nerd out about the craft of
product development?** I get it, the whole-org stuff cuts big checks, but …

Remember when UX [had to figure out how to coexist with
Agile](http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/04/integrating-ux-into-agile-
development.php)? And when UX [decided to coexist with
Lean?](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/lean-ux-vs-agile-ux-is-
there-a-difference/) Or when Product Managers needed to be [trained on
devops](http://www.mindtheproduct.com/2016/02/what-the-hell-are-ci-cd-and-

the Agile PO Role](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-owner-

they were guessing all the time and [needed to validate
outcomes](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/how-implement-hypothesis-
driven-development)? There’s still work to be done, but I’ll pull out this
quote from **The Lean Mindset** by Mary Poppendieck and Tom Poppendieck (with
illustrations from [Henrik Kniberg](https://medium.com/u/3ccad081c81a)):

> We have written three books about software development, but we couldn’t
write a fourth, because the islands of software development have largely
disappeared. In their place we find a new landscape, one in which
infrastructure is a commodity and multidisciplinary teams are expected to ask
the right questions, solve the right problems, and deliver solutions that
customers love. True, those solutions are often software-intensive. In fact,
just about everything is software-intensive these days, so isolating software
on its own island doesn’t make much sense anymore.

To what degree are we reinforcing these islands with the conferences we
organize, departments we create, blog posts we write, and titles we assign?
I’m not belittling the importance of craft, disciplines, and areas of
practice. It’s all important and we’re getting pretty damn good at it. But I’m
asking whether you also need an equal focus — a truly cross-functional focus —
on the collaborative craft.

Are we structuring our learning like we have structured our orgs? Are we
worrying more about the bastions of product, ux, agile coaching, and
engineering more than the success of what we build?

This is why I love [Jeff Patton’s](https://twitter.com/jeffpatton?lang=en)
[story mapping book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033851.do) (see
[this video for a summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R1z8POfvgQ)). On
the surface the book is about story mapping, but the subtitle “Discover the
Whole Story, Build the Right Product” is pretty spot on. It is a full-contact,
full-team sport. And everyone plays.

Where do I go to get this fix? I love me some UX and Product conferences. But
I’m also tired of people talking about other people when they’re not in the
room. Where can we all get in the same room?

Let’s discuss in the comments (if you feel like it)


# The Overlap

The Messy World of Modern Software Product Development (With User Interfaces)

* * *

### The Overlap

#### The Messy World of Modern Software Product Development (With User
Interfaces)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*p-Xmpg3MFXo3Ie4G0LgGMw.png)

In forward thinking product development organizations, **product management
and UX have become increasingly overlapped**. Concurrently, we have seen a
move towards **collaborative design** — involving engineers and other
stakeholders in the design process. These two factors have had a dramatic
impact on how product development teams organize, work, and deliver value to
customers. In this post I am going to explore some of these impacts.

#### A Vignette From the Trenches

_Everyone is reasonably good at everything (except maybe Engineering, though
some UX and Product folks have chops), and really good at some things…_

First, let me paint a picture based on my career and recent personal
experience. Imagine a team with a UX researcher, UX designer, product owner,
engineers, quality assurance, customer success rep, and an agile coach.

They’re all in a van visiting a customer’s office. They’ve been spending the
last couple days engaged in various activities: design studios, customer
journey mapping, user story mapping, listening to customer interviews, and
building a backlog of experiments to run.

The walls back at their office are plastered with artifacts…stickies from a
[pre-mortem](https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem), [a story
map](http://jpattonassociates.com/the-new-backlog/), wireframes (drawn by
everyone), and a [lean canvas](https://leanstack.com/lean-canvas/). Everyone
is engaged and contributing.

The PO isn’t the single owner of the backlog (the whole team owns it). The UX
designer isn’t the single owner of the design (the whole team owns it, and is
reasonably design savvy as a whole). The PO isn’t the sole owner of defining
the problem (the whole team explored it, with help from the UX researcher who
did a deep dive a week prior).

And the pairing! QA is pairing with UX to explore interesting edge-cases. An
engineer paired with the customer success rep to analyze existing customer
data. And the UX researcher paired with the product owner and another engineer
prior to the effort to do some preliminary research.

#### That Sounds Batshit Crazy

_This only happens in the movies… As a designer this would drive me crazy
…Can’t they just write a spec?_

  * **Sound terribly inefficient?** Perhaps, though we are chasing efficacy and outcomes and the madness addresses these goals remarkably well
  * **Sound impossible without a ton of resources?** Probably, if you only just hired your first UX designer
  * **Sound completely foreign, and you have a tough time believing things actually function this way? **It’s rare, but this is how some of the best cross-functional product development teams operate now (2016)

#### PUX

_The product owner gets their world rocked…_

The role that has been most impacted by these shifts **is the product owner**
role. No exaggeration, but my role recently as a UX researcher (at a West
Coast, recently IPOed SaaS company) was nearly indistinguishable from what I
_used _to do as a PM/PO a decade ago:

  * **User stories?** Yup, as an output of facilitated activities with the team.
  * **Deep customer/user research?** Yup, prior to and during the initiative.
  * **Measuring the impact of the initiative?** Yup, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Lines are blurred.

A Director of Product Management remarks:

> My biggest problem is the overlaps. Our UX folks and product owners have
such an overlap of responsibilities and skills, that it is difficult to keep
everyone engaged. I almost feel like a new role or title is in order. Sure,
the PO does some of the tactical record-keeping stuff. They do the status
checks and keep me informed. But the reality is that this team could run well
without one (a PO).

> My challenge is that we have already established these structures. I can’t
just say “don’t work”. I have people to engage. I want them to share in the
excitement. But in some cases their getting overwhelmed by all of these very
experienced people

This isn’t an environment that an associate product manager will navigate with
grace. It’s hard. It has become a game of who can contribute valuable context
and skills to the soup. A pure meritocracy. The customer needs no
representation because the customer is literally on the phone and the team is
decently skilled at asking the right questions. Heavy prioritization is
unnecessary because the team is moving quickly enough to try new things (with
real customers) at will.

One major factor here is the rise of UX. The UX tool chest has always been
broad (research, validation, iteration, etc.). They just didn’t get a chance
to flex their muscles until recently. Turns out designers make great
sensemakers and untanglers and know a thing or two about customer value. Throw
in collaborative design, and suddenly your engineers are a bunch of entry
level UXers and product owners. Cool huh?

Which in turn impacts the product owner. The formulaic “1 PO per one or two
teams” starts to feel very archaic. In its place we ask “what do we need, and
who can provide what we need?”:

  * If in-depth data science is required, we should find a data scientist
  * If coordination with the marketing team is required, we should find a coordinator
  * If more context is needed about the business objective, we should find a business analyst

You get the idea. To be valuable, product owners must leverage differentiated
skills. My prediction: the product owner/product manager titles will morph as
new, more specialized roles march to the trenches. [I have a simple table
describing how I see the product manager role
evolving](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/the-evolving-product-manager-role-
6f288bbc3cda).

#### The Clan

_Where do I belong? Who cuts my check?_

In a lightly matrixed environment, it is clear who your clan is. You have a
boss. You go back to home base to recharge. Your services are “loaned out” (or
even billed out, in some cases) to these teams. It’s a services model.
Engineers form the nucleus, and you swoop in when you can to help out.

Things are different with these [highly formed, normed, stormed, and
performing teams](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_86.htm). You
now have a **team **(a _squad?)_**_._** You’ve gone through rough times and
happy times. They’ve called you out in a retrospective for slacking. You made
up, and formed a stronger bond after the rift.

The matrix is hard. It is made _much harder _when you are fully embedded on a
team. It’s almost not a matrix anymore, except for the pesky question of who
gives you your marching orders to a new project, a raise, promotes you, and
coaches you. Is it the people who have contact with you day to day? Or the
whole network of coordinators and managers who exist to keep the whole matrix
pumping?

The services model brand of matrixing has given way to being fully embedded.
Everyone is invited to the retrospective. Which ironically has made things
much more confusing. My prediction is that we’ll see the matrix dissolve with
[Spotify-like chapters](http://www.full-stackagile.com/2016/02/14/team-
organisation-squads-chapters-tribes-and-guilds/) providing the functional
camaraderie, hiring, and career development. Product and UX teams must adopt
new structures to evolve.

#### Patterns and Consistency

_It won’t happen without a pattern library…_

[Jeff Gothelf](https://medium.com/u/94a2a063be85) makes a great case for
pattern libraries in [his LeanUX
book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0074KA0A4/ref=dp-kindle-
redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). Reflecting on the last couple years I can
say, without a doubt, that pattern libraries are one of the core components in
this new reality. To achieve any level of consistency in the midst of all this
independence and autonomy, you’ll need more than weekly design reviews. Things
are moving too fast for consistency to take work. Consistency needs to be
automatic. A solid _live _pattern library also empowers rapid prototyping and
collaborative design. If using the _right _pattern takes any extra work, then
the wrong pattern will hit production.

Simply put, getting the plumbing straight for this needs to happen. It needs
to be made a priority. But pulling it together will pay massive dividends.

#### T-Shaped On Purpose (Or By Accident)

_A little of this, a little o’that, and a lot of that…_

Whether we like it or not, in this model we’re all becoming more T-Shaped.
Wikipedia has some good “Also Known As” terms for T-Shaped:

  * [Versatilist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versatilist "Versatilist" )
  * Generalizing Specialist
  * Technical Craftsperson
  * Renaissance Developer
  * Master Generalist

The net effect? Well, everyone has something to say about UX and product
decisions. It might not be perfectly informed, but it’s not like you’re
operating in a vacuum. Low and behold:

  * The engineer has a better UX solution
  * The team refuses to release the crappy MVP
  * The product owner can wireframe like a bat-out-of-hell
  * We all have trained for years to do things that aren’t as easy as they seem (but the team will think they’re trivial)

This requires a big dose of humility, perspective, and empathy. Great story.
After finishing and summarizing a customer call (audio edit and notes), I
asked an engineer for some technical help. He solved it with a brilliant one-
liner.

> **Me:** Dude, that was amazing! I could never do that in a million years.  
> **Eng:** No, no … I could teach you. That call was amazing. Great stuff. I’d
never be able to do that in a million years.  
> **Me**: No, no … I could teach you.

Get used to not being the smartest person in the room. And get used to having
to show people your value, instead of hiding behind process or titles. In
prior realities someone would toss an idea over the wall, and another team
would pick it up. They’d grumble and curse about your mistakes and
incompetence, but it would never get real. Now things get real, and that’s OK
because you’ve made your environment safe right?

If not, you’re in trouble.
[Scuttlebutt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuttlebutt) makes this all fall
apart.

#### Speaking Engineer, UX, Product, QA

_We’re all on _**_A_**_ spectrum…_

What used to get resolved with silos, departments, process, and gatekeepers,
is now solved by people working it out together. Newsflash: engineers, UX, QA,
and [insert functional area here] don’t always communicate the same way. For
teams to function like this you need help (Agile Coaching?), time, and
patience. You can’t just drop a junior person into the mix and hope they “pick
it up”. To an outsider it’ll seem crazy.

We all have to develop great communication skills. There is no filter, and
waiting around for one would be kind of silly.

#### In Closing

This has been rambling, and I’ll probably go deeper in future posts. Let me
try to recap:

  * A lot of rules, process, and titles get messed up the further you advance down the road towards fully autonomous, cross-functional teams. If you try to cling to the old way, you’ll really confuse people. You have to take the plunge to discover new structures and ways of working (which will also confuse people)
  * The further you evolve the more challenging the PO role becomes
  * The Matrix dissolves or morphs. New structures and ways of working rise from the ashes. Anyone can provide value anywhere. You’ll still need to become an expert at melding with new teams though
  * Anything that happens “just because” doesn’t cut it. Is the team functioning with the necessary skills and hats? If not, change things
  * We need to adapt to a new reality of T-Shaped individuals, and learn how to communicate without pre-defined processes
  * It’s messy as hell! And the tendency is to say “oh, it’s too messy and inefficient”. But if you let these types of teams build their mojo you’ll be blown away by the results


# 6 Questions to Guide Continuous Improvement

Do the work…

* * *

### 6 Questions to Guide Continuous Improvement

#### Do the work…

There’s no silver bullet: continuous improvement takes resources and work,
humility, empathy, and [teaming](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle
/productCd-078797093X.html). It is less about the methodology you pick (across
hundreds of templates and books you’ll find remarkably similar themes these
days) and more about the work you do, and the degree to which you can reflect
on the meta-process of improving how you improve.

Which means we need to heed [Steven Pressfield’s advice and Do The
Work](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NK0MJBK/ref=dp-kindle-
redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1).

Give it a try!

**Below you’ll find 6 questions that I have found particularly useful for guiding continuous improvement efforts.** Gather a cross-section from your team — mixed seniority and functional areas — and have a conversation about these questions. Of course, you’ll need safety (see question 1) to have the conversation (see question 6), but maybe that is your starting point. That’s your first hurdle. You have to start somewhere.

See the **Notes** section for some commentary on these questions

How **effective are we at:**

  1. Maintaining a safe and healthy environment for individuals and teams?
  2. Resolving areas of widespread cognitive dissonance?
  3. Learning and converting our learnings into customer value?
  4. Dampening the negative impacts of scaling and growth?
  5. Helping our people and teams grow?
  6. Sensing changes to, and continuously improving on the the areas above?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*QKJ5w5WS_zX7myiutqR4KQ.png)

Talk about it. What have you observed? What is the delta since you last spoke?
How do your individual biases impact your perception of what you have
observed? Are you hearing all voices? Are you missing data? Where are the
opportunities for improvement? What would happen if you did nothing? Might
certain things just work themselves out?

One of my mentors wisely cautioned:

> Fight the temptation to see continuous improvement as a conduit for your pet
projects and career advancement. It’s tempting. One of the biggest blockers to
change is the desire to take credit for it.

Set a “Change In Progress” limit and prioritize [safe-to-fail
experiments](http://cognitive-edge.com/methods/safe-to-fail-probes/). Too much
change or change that is too prescriptive is the enemy of successful
evolution. Stop starting and start finishing. Consider a continuous
improvement Kanban board detailing ongoing efforts. Rinse and repeat. [As
David Snowden writes:](https://hbr.org/2007/11/a-leaders-framework-for-
decision-making)

> Instructive patterns can emerge if the leader conducts experiments that are
safe to fail. That is why, instead of attempting to impose a course of action,
leaders must patiently allow the path forward to reveal itself. They need to
probe first, then sense, and then respond.

This requires a certain level of introspection and humility. What if a leader
is contributing to the problem? At the root of cognitive dissonance (2) we
often find friction between leaders which manifests in unclear objectives and
unnecessary tension. To see our own failings more clearly it may be necessary
to cast a wider net for data (e.g. engagement surveys, 360 and peer reviews,
etc.) Leaders are, in that regard, team members. It is Team with a capital
“T”.

### Notes

  1. Safe environments welcome diversity, risk taking, experimentation, dissent, and sharing difficult feedback. Individuals can be authentic. Unsafe environments do this selectively, or not at all
  2. Examples might include the acceptance of toxic behavior from an individual, inability to respond to a growing threat, or situation where teams/individuals have accepted a way of working that is hurtful/unhealthy to others. It is widespread in the sense that has reached “watercooler status” or a frequent topic of 1:1 so-called [scuttlebutt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuttlebutt)
  3. Context and data can inform a team, but it does not in itself produce positive outcomes. You’re marrying two competencies — to [Sense and Respond](http://senseandrespond.co/)
  4. Examples of negative effects attributable to scaling and growth include accumulation of technical debt, UX debt, increased dependencies, hardening silos, decreased speed and agility, decreased information flow, disengaged teams, premature optimization, etc. Many of these “costs” are invisible and difficult to quantity which complicates the issue.
  5. Importantly, this can sometimes involve individuals “growing out” of the organization. One could argue that for the benefit of the company you’d like to see a shared growth goal that benefits company / individual, but I’ve found this to be unrealistic and counterproductive expectation (and profoundly immune to intervention).
  6. Continuous improvement involves regular discussion, action, and reflection. Are you addressing the right questions? Are your conversations safe? Are you gathering all available data?


# To the 40+ Year Old PMs

Do you stay in the trenches, or get out? Why? And what does this mean for
teams?

* * *

### To the 40+ Year Old PMs

#### Do you stay in the trenches, or get out? Why? And what does this mean for
teams?

You’re 40+ and involved in product management.

Maybe you took some detours in your twenties and thirties: played in a band
(that’s me!), started a business (yup, did that), freelanced to be at home
with your kids while they were young, or tried something completely different.

You love product development. You want to stay on the front lines and in the
trenches. You want to remain a doer. You enjoy coaching, mentoring, and
showing people how to fish, but you aren’t a good fit for traditional
management roles. You speak product, UX, business, and engineer. The extra
money would be nice, but so is your sanity and sense of accomplishment.

Your pattern matching and BS detector is on point. You see organizational
dysfunction through the sharp eyes of someone who has played the game for a
while. Maybe that’s not your sweetspot.

If you’re engineer, there is a path. Be a 10x behind-the-scenes person. Most
orgs welcome that. Craft it up, coach folks, and crank it out. You’re making
$200k and still get to keep your hands dirty.

But us older product owners and product managers … we have a different
predicament. We’re being told to “advance”, “move up”, “shift companies”,
“move out of product management” (for PMs), or “start consulting” (for more UX
focused PM/POs). Recently, I was told bluntly that “if this hasn’t happened by
the time you’re 40, well that is a warning sign!”

But I like being on the front-lines!

The trouble is that the further you “move up”, the further you get away from
where the work is happening, and the closer you get to executive level
dysfunction. For some that means a desirable corner office. For others that
makes it un-fun. Explains a fellow PM:

> I keep struggling with this dilemma. If I care for my career and earning
potential I will need to stop doing this! But I work best and provide the most
value when I’m with my teams. It seems like my best option is to company hop
for a while to keep things interesting

Agile prescribes a PM/PO for every one or two teams. As teams scale this
necessitates an ungainly product org. The economics kick in and you fill your
org with junior and/or associate PMs to fill the warm seat prescribed by
Agile. Which in turn pisses off your experienced engineers. You’re being told
to leave the area where your impact is needed most.

And then people wonder where the good PM/POs have gone! If you’re a more
technically focused PM/PO you might have some options, but for many this is
the end of the line.

I don’t have an answer here. But this is a problem if we are to advance the
“craft” of product management and product ownership and deliver great value to
teams. How do you engage your older team members and keep your best? Or is
this the inevitable conveyor belt of talent and career development?


# #agilebrandproblem

This morning I woke up to this tweet from Jeff Patton:

### #agilebrandproblem

This morning I woke up to this tweet from Jeff Patton:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*IqYsOliimYMyaoKB.)

I found this interesting on a number levels. First, it was a gimme punchline
at a product conference. Well played! I’ve heard plenty of gimme PM jokes at
other conferences, so it sort of comes with the conference territory. Not a
big deal.

Second, I found it laced with some juicy (likely unintentional) irony. I’m
pretty up on the product community, and I’ve polled people during my talks, so
I feel fairly confident to point out some likely patterns and quotes from a
good chunk of the 1,400 people in attendance during their day to day work:

  * “We need to ship more quickly”
  * “How many _resources _do I have at my disposal to build this stuff?”
  * “We have to move on to the next feature so [insert reason here]”
  * “We can’t afford to work down that technical debt! You’re guessing it will keep us from slowing down. I need data”
  * “I need an estimate, please, so I can [ insert reason here ]”
  * “We really need to get an MVP out there now! And then we’ll, um, come back to it at some point in the future after we’ve done [other things]”
  * How infrequently product managers actually focus on customer outcomes vs. feature delivery
  * How often PMs shoot for 100% utilization (aka team Tetris), which sets up teams for catastrophic collapse when something doesn’t go right, which in turn impacts the customer
  * The conference is called Mind The Product, not Mind The Customer. Sure, we still purchase products. But in the software world we are increasingly renting services (delivered through various, evolving products / touch-points) that yield outcomes. In my experience, PMs often have primary allegiance to this nebulous “product”, not customers, users, or outcomes

No wonder people use points and velocity! No wonder some forward thinkers in
the Agile community are arguing that estimates shouldn’t be necessary (see
#noestimates). No wonder UX is injecting some life into product management!

I’m pretty sure this wasn’t what the speaker was thinking. Maybe they were
selling something else. So I’ll just let it blow over as a good joke.

Anyway, what I was struck most by was Jeff’s term Agile Brand Problem
(#agilebrandproblem). The **branding** of Agile, and all the various ways
people are trying to capitalize on that brand … yeah, there’s your problem.

I’ve attended big Agile conferences. And yes, the busy tracks are filled with
people buying into the Agile solution. Let’s DO AGILE™ THE BRAND. It makes it
it an easy target for conference jokes. The UX and Product tracks can be
pretty sparse, and PO focused talks tend to bring out the Agile Coaches trying
desperately to help their POs do their job.

Heck, even Agilists crack jokes about Agile (see [Joshua
Kerievsky](https://medium.com/u/28229c304ac9) and his wonderful Modern Agile
work, and read up on his great jokes at Agile 2016). I like Josh’s approach
because he’s not being dogmatic, and evolving like Agile suggests you evolve.

Agile has become an umbrella term for so many practices, methodologies,
frames, principles, stuff to buy, people to hire, etc. that it’s bewildering
to the user (forget branding for a moment). But I think this is natural as
things like Agile evolve. They start focused and principle based. Then welcome
all sorts of experimentation and exploitation and grow a chest of offshoots
and interpretations. And then sort of fold in on themselves under the weight.
Layer that with two (and now coming on three) generations of consultants
looking for their Agile Angle, and you’ll develop a self-inflicted branding
problem.

At this point Lean is sort of past that. It is sufficiently “old” that you can
use it at will, anywhere, without too much of the baggage. Once people got
over the six-sigma associations and connecting it primarily with
manufacturing, it became a good nondescript gimme that could be tacked on to
anything for good effect. Are people trying to brand Lean as just Lean™? Let
me know.

Anyway. Being a punchline is nothing new for Agile, Product Managers,
Engineers, UX, Project Managers, etc. It’s easy to have a laugh. But it
doesn’t really move forward the craft of product development. Rah rah
conferences for the functional skillsets are good for keeping the hope alive,
sharing information, and having some beers with likeminded individuals. Real
work is required to figure out how we can work together.

An actual set of notes … my spelling is atrocious

What is it like to drop into organization and take stock of the team?

I was asked recently to describe what was going on in my head when I meet with
teams for the first time. There are scorecards and maturity models for all
this, but I found myself talking in terms of themes and areas of inquiry.
Below I’ve taken a stab at listing what I look for when I’m doing a health-
check for a new team. Hopefully this is of some use to internal coaches,
analysts, consultants, VCs, or individuals vetting prospective employer.

Important! It is very tempting to let your biases run rampant here. Keep
reminding yourself to focus on individual, team, customer, and organization
needs. What must this team excel at given their situation?

  1. **Decisions.** What is their product development decision track-record. A perfect track-record is not what we’re looking for. How quickly do they make reasonably good decisions? Do they flounder until someone makes a political breakthrough and advances their specific agenda? Or are decent decisions delivered more regularly? Equally important, look for the process by which the team measures and reflects on the quality of their decisions.
  2. **Information Flow.** How does information flow from the market and customers to the builders and designers on the front-lines? Where is there signal loss? Where are there switches and filters? Where is the signal amplified?
  3. **Continuous Improvement.** What is their approach to continuous improvement? How is it directed and controlled? Who participates? Can the team point to tangible examples of improvement? Look for efforts to take credit for improvement efforts. Struggle over ownership of change efforts is often the blocker to meaningful change.
  4. **Internal Feedback Loops.** Thinking beyond the market/customer feedback loop, describe how feedback moves internally … up, down, and across. Is it funneled, and if so by whom? Who “knows everything” and why? This is related to continuous improvement, but worth mapping out to compliment that discussion.
  5. **Handoffs.** Spend time observing handoffs. These can be incredibly informative. How does an idea get delivered? Who is waiting for what? Are sprints staggered? Focus on the I/O of the organization and the various functional roles. Map these out. Are these handoffs a function of team needs, or the needs of the organization to control work?
  6. **Utilization Rates.** Is utilization very high? Scan for examples of “keeping people busy” and chasing high utilization. Also look for mechanisms that preserve slack. Couple this with attitudes towards multi-tasking and tackling concurrent projects. There is no right/wrong here (there are economic reasons to tackle multiple projects), but it pays to pay attention.
  7. **Flow.** I’m a big believer in the concept of [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29). Mostly because it’s something people everywhere can relate to. You’re suitably challenged, you’re in the zone, and you exude a calm, productive energy. You sense your impact. Are individuals and teams experiencing a sense of flow? How often? If not, what happens instead? Is there high drama, a lot of start and stop, or a sense of being “stuck”?
  8. **Debt Work-Down.** How does the organization monitor and work down its various areas of debt (learning, UX, tech, cultural, etc.) ? Is there shared understanding around the costs/rewards? Does the team routinely work down debt, including the removal of unused features? How are these costs “accounted” for?
  9. **Roadmap.** Ask to see the product roadmap, and discuss how it is used as an artifact across the organization. Is it a list of features? How are the goals described? Is it shared broadly? Is it a living document? Why, and why not? Explore how other roadmap users (from the front-lines to the leadership team) view the roadmap process. Are people getting value out of the roadmap?
  10. **Data/Evidence.** How is qualitative and quantitative data used to drive decisions? Is data a regular part of the decisions making process, or is the approach more “ad hoc”? What is on the monitors in the hallway? Where do the data-silos exist, and do people care?
  11. **Mentorship/Coaching.** What is the approach to mentorship and coaching? Approach this from a broad perspective (most efforts are not formal). Do team members attribute their personal and professional development to the organization and/or people in the organization? How do people grow? Where does someone go if the blocker is their boss?
  12. **Ideas vs. Problems.** Is this an idea oriented team or a problem focused team? Check for mentions of the best idea winning, the need to advocate strongly for your ideas, or celebrating great ideas. Contrast this with a problem focused frame, where the team relates strongly to solving a particular problem for a customer/user (or the organization). One isn’t better than another, but this will have a strong impact on how the org operates.
  13. **Features vs. Outcomes.** Somewhat related … is the team feature-centric or outcome/mission centric? Pay close attention to how/when teams celebrate, and what they celebrate. Look at user stories and backlog items. Listen during meetings. Is a project “done” when it ships?
  14. **Collaboration.** How does collaboration happen in the day-to-day? Spend time observing people work together. Is the mood forced and artificial, or voluntary and natural? Contrast this with the official narrative on how work gets done.
  15. **Cross-Functional Interactions.** Focus specifically on cross-functional interactions. Where is this easy, and where is it hard? Where do buffers exist? Who initiates these interactions? Is it driven by process, or by local need? Is the office organized to encourage the cross pollination of ideas?
  16. **Work Division.** How is work divided among teams and individuals? Refer to the org chart, and contrast this with what you see on the ground. Are there functional silos? Component teams? Is Conway’s Law in effect? Who makes the decisions on how to divvy the challenge? Are these structures morphable and adaptable to address present needs? Do teams have some say in what they work on?
  17. **Safety and Trust.** Is there sufficient safety and trust for teams to “get real”? Where _can_ this happen and where _does_ it happen? Where are the natural boundaries to safety? Could a front-line engineer have a frank discussion with the CEO? What would happen?
  18. **Cadenced Meetings.** Do an inventory of cadenced meetings. Who is invited? Who actually participates? How does the output of the meeting catalyze action elsewhere?
  19. **Releasing Product.** Can the team release product without fear? And is there a devops mindset? Figure out what is actually involved for something to get into the hands of customers. Who must approve? Who must touch it? How does the team know if something is amiss?
  20. **This vs. That.** Listen for how the team describes the various dichotomies / tensions in their work. Is it speed vs. quality? Learning vs. shipping? Proud vs. shipped? These narratives can tell you a great deal about the forces at play
  21. **Core Relationships.** The organization will typically mimic the relationships of a couple core individuals (often leaders, sometimes founders, etc.) Look closely at these relationships. Are there overlapping strengths? Productive tensions? Trust?
  22. **Safe To Fail.** How often does the team fail, openly acknowledge that failure, and indicate the ability to learn from that failure? Is their approach too safe? Could they be taking more risks? We are looking for a healthy amount of failure, otherwise there’s likely not enough learning happening
  23. **Messy Middle.** Look closely at the “messy middle” of the organization that sits between leadership, and the individuals doing the work. What happens there? What is the value add? Is this group open to change, or intent on controlling it?
  24. **Me vs. We vs. Them.** Focus on how words are used. Listen for I, Me, Us, We, They, or Them. How does that manifest in how individuals and teams interact?
  25. **Craft Communities.** Are there informal communities of craft (and practice) ? You’re looking here for the ability for the various functional groups in the org to support themselves vs. needing more formal structures.
  26. **Expert Status.** What is this organization great at? By great I mean true, world class experts. Is that known and celebrated? Is it the “right” thing to excel at?
  27. **Walls.** What is on the walls? You’d be amazed at what you can learn by just looking at the walls. Are the whiteboards outdated? How about stickies? Kanban boards?
  28. **Consistency.** How is consistency maintained? This is an interesting one. There are ways to maintain consistency that involve a lot of command and control. For example, you can set up a design review board and approve designs individually. Conversely, you can also maintain design consistency with a living pattern library and communities of interest. That’s one example. You can expand this to other areas including quality efforts, hiring, etc.
  29. **Celebration.** Pay attention to how the organization celebrates its wins and learns from its mistakes. Do teams get credit? Individuals? Is work viewed as a slog, or is there a natural ebb and flow?
  30. **Narratives.** I’m amazed by how many teams are incapable of sharing their foundational stories. What has brought them to this point? When did they slay the last dragon? Dig for stories as they form the foundation.

Hope this helps others as they analyze a product development team.


# What Do You Need? What Do We Need?

What do you need? What does your company need? Why? What are you trying to
achieve? What must you optimize for?

Doodling while thinking about the “real” org chart

Change is not difficult. Agreeing on what to change — what you need — is
difficult. Resistance to change is not static. It is active and tightly wound
… a system of competing change initiatives. This is why it is easy for
consultants to plot the “right” way forward, but no silver-bullet to actually
enact that change.

Need is a tricky topic. Individuals have needs. Individuals band together as
teams, and those teams express the amalgam of individual needs. In theory we
develop a product that addresses the needs of our customers, partners, and
“market”. These complex systems develop ecosystem-like needs of their own.

Here’s a list of needs expressed at a recent retro I facilitated:

  * Long, mid, and short term economic outcomes for the organization
  * Long, mid, and short term economic outcomes for individuals
  * Improving outcomes for customers
  * Addressing the needs of the user when there is a customer/user differentiation
  * Individual challenge and skills development
  * Increased sphere of influence for individuals
  * Opportunity to practice craft (e.g. “good design”, or “clean code”)
  * Advancing a cause, disruptive change, mission, or fundamental shift
  * Eliminating frustration, “busy work”, focus on optimization and “smooth sailing”
  * Maintaining unity, harmony, quality of personal relationships. Community building
  * Preserving / defending psychological safety

Consider an example.

  * A **UX team member** is advocating for a solution that will contribute to the organization’s long term economic outcomes, meet their definition of a “good job”, increase the influence of UX in the organization, and let them notch a win which assures their mid-term economic survival.
  * Meanwhile **the product manager** advocates for a solution that addresses short term economic realities, only marginally improves customer outcomes, and maintains a healthy (but perhaps less optimal) harmony between stakeholder needs.

Who is right? Throw in another hundred people into the mix. Who is right now?
Is there a right answer? No. But some things most certainly have a negative
impact:

  1. Assuming your past experiences qualify you to interpret future needs, or that your organization’s needs today will resemble its needs in the future
  2. Lacking fundamental psychological safety in your organization. Are people free and safe to express their needs and perspectives?
  3. Expecting to change individual value systems. You might help someone become more at peace with their values, or show more empathy for the needs of others, but trying to change what they value is a tall order
  4. Assuming someone isn’t motivated because they don’t care about the same things you care about.
  5. Assuming you’re talking about the same thing when you say something like “user friendly” or “agile” or “pivot”. Shared understanding matters
  6. Failing to express your own needs as your own needs. Instead of saying “it is important for me to consider the customer in this case” you advocate for a methodology, or directly attack the motives of a team member. Are you communicating your own needs effectively?
  7. Assuming everyone cares about the economic success of the business in the same way. Some people don’t care at all, or they prioritize customer outcomes over business outcomes, or they care primarily about short/long term outcomes. What can you leverage in this case for everyone’s mutual benefit?
  8. Assuming a person’s passion for a point of view is proportional to the amount of time they spend complaining about it. They might care, but not _really _care. Or they may be afraid, and choose not to voice their deep concerns.

This is what I’ve been mulling on today.

What do I need? What do you need?It’s a good start.


# 10 Ways PMs Can Earn The Respect and Trust of Their Team

… because once you’ve lost it, you’re pretty screwed

### 10 Ways PMs Can Earn The Respect and Trust of Their Team

#### … because once you’ve lost it, you’re pretty screwed

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*X57glPnDN_hC08jWZQXn3A.png)

In [Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon
Valley](https://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Monkeys-Obscene-Fortune-Failure-
ebook/dp/B019MMUAAQ), Antonio Garcia Martinez describes the plight of the
disrespected and distrusted PM:

> The most pitiful sight in the Facebook Ads team was the PMs who had lost the
confidence of their engineers. Nominally in charge of some product area, they
were like the government in exile of some occupied nation: sitting there with
all the pomp of their position, sending emails and road maps hither and yon,
and yet producing nothing.

Similarly, I’ve seen teams that waited until the product manager disappeared
for the next meeting, and then let out a collective groan of dismay. Sadly,
this is often a gradual process. A couple bad decisions. Some back pedaling. A
white lie. Some marathon meetings with no purpose/point. So it’s better to
have a positive start.

How do you earn the respect and trust of your team?

  1. **Create “passing tests” for your product development initiatives**, and be diligent about reporting on progress. Heck, engineers do this all day, so some rigor on your side is always appreciated. I’m not talking “did it ship?”. I’m talking “what progress are we making towards meeting the desired business objective?” or “were my assumptions correct or not?” Sure, making decisions that turn out to kick-ass goes a long way towards building a level of respect, but so does being honest about your failures and lapses of judgement.
  2. **Don’t be a pushover**. It’s easy for the team to see through you. You come back from a big meeting, moping, tentative, and then mutter something about needing to move on to the next feature. Now, you may have fought tooth and nail in that meeting to stay the course, but the team doesn’t know that. At the next standup, they see a pummeled and beaten PM. The solution is to avoid getting to this point in the first place. Align people around a goal early, and fight to stay focused on that goal until you’ve reached a precise point (a passing test). If you can’t do that for whatever reason, be clear about that from the get-go. Sometimes being the whipping boy/girl for your org is just how the PM cookie crumbles (in which case you might consider another job).
  3. **Acknowledge what you don’t know. Don’t make shit up! **Don’t say “well customers are saying …. “ when you can’t list those customers, or those two customers represent 2% of your customer-base. Don’t say “the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive” when you did a single call. When you’re using your intuition, say “my intuition — based on x,y,z — tells me option A”. Humility goes a long way.
  4. **Treat your team like adults!** If you go home each night fashioning yourself a cat herder, it will manifest in your day to day work. “Those crazy engineers with their nerf guns! Thank goodness there’s an adult here that lives in the real world of business and has to attend stressful meetings all day” … **don’t think or say that, because you’ll act like a jerk.** You are not their manager. You are the product’s manager. Any hint of paternalism and you’re DOA (dead on arrival). This also goes for giving and receiving (hopefully constructive) feedback. Yes, you can go run off behind the team’s back and have a teary-eyed 1:1 with a scrum master or tech lead begging to be respected. Or you can advocate for a regular and well-facilitated retro and in a non-defensive manner accept and give feedback like an adult.
  5. **Don’t stereotype.** Related to #3, but resist the various software engineer stereotypes that exist. I know engineers with social anxiety, engineers who win Toastmasters, former golf pros, guitar god engineers, guys/girls who code best when high, ballroom dancing engineers, ex-Army Rangers, and brogrammers. Nothing quashes respect faster than assuming everyone is [insert whatever you think here].
  6. **Do something valuable!** Seriously, imagine if you were knee-deep in solving complex problems, and someone showed up after 6hrs of meetings with nothing to show for it, or no additional information that assisted you in solving your problem? And loaded you up with new tasks and lots of annoying questions about estimates as they seemingly played Tetris with you and your teammates? You’d lose respect for the person. Start with a simple “what can I do to help” or “what data or context can I provide?” Make yourself available but don’t distract. Deliver value to the team. I’ve said this before, but my favorite questions for a team is “if you controlled the budget, would you hire your current PM?” Not providing value at this particular moment? Well, then go away and let people work!
  7. **Respect context switching, the price of multi-tasking, and the need for slack.** Think about the message you’re sending when you try to keep the team nose-to-the-grindstone, 98% utilized, every minute of the year. Or harp away about velocity and story points. Or be an ass about debt work-down stories or refactoring. Do you think that cramming those four extra points into the 40 point week is going to make a big difference? No. And when something goes slightly wrong, and the over-taxed team goes into a death spiral, it will royally suck. Don’t play Team Tetris. Product development isn’t an assembly line. The goal is to ship outcomes, not story output.
  8. **Do the mental gymnastics**. Related to #6. I once had an engineer friend tell me “you know, I don’t inherently dislike specs. In fact, if you write an excellent spec it will make my day. What I dislike are commands where the person doesn’t think about the problem. They just spew out requirements and don’t think the thing through.” Analyze the customer problem. Consider the non-happy path. Find different angles. Do your homework. Speak economically, but be able to back up your suggestions. You may not be an engineer. You may not be technical. But you can at least practice sound reasoning and problem solving.
  9. **Stop talking about YOUR ideas. **Represent the customer and their problems. Talk about business opportunities. Bring data and context. Be an amplifier. Suggest your ideas, but bring everyone to the table to discuss alternate proposals. To many engineers, PMs come off as narcissistic, CEO wannabes, with nothing tangible to add, and a lot of career aspirations. This team assignment is just the stepping stone. You have to create a persuasive case for the outlay of effort beyond “um, the business thinks this is a good idea” or “this will totally rock!” I’ve heard it mentioned that engineers make a cost/benefit decisions once every 15 minutes. Before cluttering up the code base, they want to hear a halfway decent rationale for the work. And they remember prior decisions like hawks. That feature you shipped two years ago? Yeah, no one ended up using it. Strike three against you! It’s easy to assume your team doesn’t care if they don’t ask. I’ve even had engineers say “you know, I don’t care anymore, just tell me what to do.” But this is result of losing respect for you. You have to rebuild it.
  10. **Have fun and don’t be a basket case.**


# Helicopter Management, Teal, and Stirring The Soup

We’ve exchanged command and control for coax and manipulate

* * *

#### Get Shift Done: Management

### Helicopter Management, Teal, and Stirring The Soup

#### We’ve exchanged command and control for coax and manipulate

You thought things were political before?

The irony of fostering autonomous and self-organizing teams is that it
eventually negates the need for traditional management. This is a common
pattern observed during re-orgs and “transformations”. Being savvy career-
wise, management tries to adapt and in the process becomes even more spooky
and political. It’s like parents transitioning from command and control to
[helicopter parenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_parent). In
some cases it is downright Orwellian.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dL_2WWibLJkuIyN14qS7ow.png)

Have you heard of _teal_ organizations? Teal is where it’s at (it is [humbly
referred to](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Teal_Organizations)
as the “next stage in the evolution of human consciousness”). Teal isn’t some
drab Orange:

> The hierarchical “predict and control” pyramid of Orange is replaced with a
decentralized structure consisting of small teams that take responsibility for
their own governance and for how they interact with other parts of the
organization.

Anyway, no one wants to be Orange when there’s something brighter and more
Tealy out there. No one wants to be a mere manager. That’s a dead end gig.
[Sydney Finkelstein writes](http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20150624-the-end-
of-middle-management):

> We should no longer expect traditional job ladders for managers to move up
the ranks, or even retaining the notion that middle managers are the glue that
connects workers and ensures goal alignment up and down the hierarchy.

**Leadership** is the where the action is.

What this means is you’ve got a clusterfuck of people trying to reinvent
themselves as facilitators, mentors, motivators, and, um, leaders. Orange and
Teal mixed to a frothy brown. It’s the same urge — to wield power, expand
influence, and advance career — just now under a [thin veil of Simon Sinek
dulcet tones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4). Throw in the
incessant 1:1 meetings, passive aggressive political posturing, and gag
inducing cultural manifestos, and you’ve got something far more oppressive
than command and control.

My point here isn’t to say that there aren’t better ways of working. I believe
in autonomous, self-organizing teams. I believe in quality facilitation and
mentorship. I believe the front-lines are the best to make decisions, and
should have the data to make those decisions. And I believe the front-lines
should “hire” managers and help when they need it. Above all, and above all
dogmas, what works, works.

But do you notice the degree to which this has all been co-opted? The people
who need to be paying the most attention, and changing their habits the most,
are the folks playing god with the front-lines. They’re stirring the soup and
opaquely tweaking and probing the culture. They’re reading up on systems
thinking and complexity theory on one breath, and then plotting their
ascension in the other. It feels kind of shitty.

This is the environment that many builders, crafters, makers find themselves
in: in organizations caught uncomfortably mid-evolution, half getting it, but
not able to get out of their own way. We’ve exchanged command and control for
coax and manipulate.

The answer is to empower the front-lines to get the work done, coach,
facilitate, and get out the way. And that’s a hard pill for some to swallow.

# Should We Do [ Agile, Kanban, Design Thinking, LeanUX, …]

* * *

### Should We Do [ Agile, Kanban, Design Thinking, LeanUX, …]

Should we DO Design Thinking? Should we DO Lean Startup. Should we DO Agile?
Should we DO LeanUX?

**No. Just DO IT.**

> [](https://twitter.com/practicingdev/status/785986850787725317)

Stop searching for a silver bullet.

Become a student. Get to work. Reflect. Adapt. Roll your own.

I’m profoundly grateful for the work of the Agile community, the tradition of
Lean in all of its various permutations (from TPS, Lean Startup, to Kanban),
and the various design methodologies (e.g. Design Thinking). Because of their
hard work, you — along with some other members of your team — can hit Google,
read some books, maybe hit a conference/class and just DO IT (“it” being some
form of trying things, reflecting, and adapting).

Yeah, you. No degree required. You can probably get started without that $2500
a day course. Put on your thinking (and feeling, and observing) cap and go.

Lest you think you can put everything into neat boxes, read the history of
[Lean Startup](http://www.salimvirani.com/the-history-of-leanstartup-and-how-
to-make-sense-of-it-all/), the [Agile
Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/history.html),
[Agile](http://techbeacon.com/agility-beyond-history%E2%80%94-legacy%E2%80%94
-agile-development), [Kanban for Knowledge Work](http://www.djaa.com/brief-
history-kanban-knowledge-work), and [design
thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking#History). If you trace
back the coining of most “ways” you’ll find people DOING IT out there in the
real world, drawing from multiple traditions to chip away at a problem.
Spotify Method … [Spotify’s engineering team decided to rewrite the rules and
create their own agile methodology](http://reqtest.com/blog/how-spotify-does-
agile-a-look-at-the-spotify-engineering-culture/). XP … Kent Beck’s “[role
expanded as he noted several problems they were having with their development
process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming#Origins).” Lean UX
… [was honed by Jeff Gothelf and his team at The
Ladders](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2011/05/case-study-lean-ux-at-
work.html).

At some point, someone was DOING IT. IT started to work. Manifestos were
written. Then books published and the requisite book tour. Conferences held.
Consulting practices established. Then McConsulting practices. Buzzwords
promulgated. Tweets blasted. The Big 3 Swooped In.

Things got complicated, I get it, but not something a Sunday morning, the
internet, and some coffee can’t handle. You’ve got this!

I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that none of this is rocket
science. The hard work of boiling down the traditions to actionable steps has
already happened. To be in the top 5% you don’t need rocket science. Talk to
any consultant, and they’ll admit that the biggest hurdle is moving past the
political bullshit, incompatible HR policies, silos, soon-to-be obsolete job
responsibilities, and the momentum of the “old way”. Cliche as it sounds, it
is invariably a people problem. And, importantly, having people around who
have either 1) done it or something kind of like it before, or 2) have enough
time to do their homework, and exist in an organization where trying new
things doesn’t carry a huge political risk.

The hard work is ahead of you ([read about Intuits 8 year design thinking
quest](https://hbr.org/2015/01/intuits-ceo-on-building-a-design-driven-
company)). Don’t get paralyzed on methods. That’s the easy stuff. Becoming a
learning organization — capable of inventing and adapting your system — now
that is HARD.

“But, but, but … everyone is worried that IT won’t work! So we need to be
extra sure that IT is what we need. I read that IT sucks. And that IT is the
hot thing.”

Do your homework on these traditions: there’s so much cross-over, borrowing,
and evolution. You’re going to end up with a Franken-Method, so you might as
well embrace that! Anyone who is looking for “the way” has either 1) maxed out
all available options, and is doing swimmingly (file under problems you’d like
to have), or 2) is delusional about the power of “the way”.

So… JUST DO IT.

### 24-Point Checklist for PM/PO Candidates

For a quick post today I thought I’d share a personal checklist for assessing
product management / product owner candidates. These 24 items are useful when
1) thinking about the role you hope to fill, and 2) assessing a candidate. It
can take a lifetime of shipping to max out your chops, so it is important to
view all of these skills on a continuum.

# SaaS and the Impostor Clairvoyant PM

Why most estimation, ROI calculations, and heavy upfront planning is a waste
of time in SaaS

### SaaS and the Impostor Clairvoyant PM

#### Why most estimation, ROI calculations, and heavy upfront planning is a
waste of time in SaaS

This post is about fear and uncertainty, how we respond to that uncertainty,
and how we accidentally perpetuate learned helplessness in software
development.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gppqlsgZYxHoWPHyuKXDng.png)

<http://lisapapineau.blogspot.com/2012/03/actresses-and-crystal-ball.html>

SaaS products are service touch-points. Customers don’t buy, they rent or pay-
per-use. Adding features to the product cannot be equated to adding features
to a physical product. The feature may be “shipped”, but more accurately you
are establishing a potential value stream in a complex service ecosystem. [To
quote Dave Snowden](http://cognitive-edge.com/blog/safe-the-infantilism-of-
management/), “software development needs to be seen as a service and as an
ecology not as a manufacturing process.” Yet, the vestiges of manufacturing
remain.

Complexity triggers our defense instincts.

We plan. We play planning poker. We estimate. We play “buy a feature” with our
stakeholders. We try to calculate ROI (the cost and reward side). We draw
linear process flows as circles and call them loops. We stoke the feature
factory, crank the velocity, add bullet points to feature lists, and bask in a
false sense of rigor. Output soothes the nerves, albeit temporarily.

As Snowden remarks, “going through a linear process in shorter cycles or
drawing it as a circle does not make it non-linear”. Our challenge is
nonlinear. Therefore, you’re battling a mismatch between the problem space and
the approach. Manufactured Product = linear. Service = nonlinear, complex
adaptive system.

Remarked a developer friend:

> After all the ****ing song and dance with estimates, it is three months
later and no one is using the damn thing. It was shipped and forgotten … on to
the next feature right away. We were 1.2x of estimate, yet the ROI discussed
is tracking at .2 … probably negative if you figure in the technical debt we
were forced to add. We’ll lose money! But hey … we are “predictable”

The reality is that we are not great at predicting/understanding:

  1. how customers will actually use what what we build in their real-world environments
  2. when and what we will learn, and what opportunities may emerge
  3. the emergence of new technologies, changes in competitive landscape, changing usage habits, micro and macro economic trends, evolving customer needs, emergence of new opportunities
  4. how an individual feature will contribute to the overall value of a product from the customer, user, and/or business perspective. Customers are notoriously bad at estimating the value of a proposed enhancement
  5. breadth of usage and growth in breadth of usage over time
  6. the rate with which perceived value will degrade. Today’s delighter is tomorrow’s table stakes feature ([see Kano Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_model))
  7. the actual ongoing cost of adding new functionality (maintenance, support, increase in technical debt, training, complexity, etc.) Upfront engineering costs typically represent a small % of overall cost
  8. the impact of various nonlinear effects caused by increased complexity (for example, doubling team size doesn’t produce 2x outcomes)

But, but, but, but …. we should still try, right?

It’s not worth it. Heavy business cases, ROI calculations, project estimates,
feature estimates, complex prioritization schemes, etc. — all of that upfront
stuff — is mostly useless. They reinforce a linear delivery model mindset and
being able to predict the items above. We might progressively narrow in on an
ROI estimate over time, but solving that puzzle upfront is nearly impossible.

Your best bet is to aim resources at a seemingly valuable problem to solve (or
customer’s job-to-be-done), attempt to continuously deliver value, and hone
your ability to “[sense and
respond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_respond)” based on what
happens. We may not be great at the points above, but we’re better when we
actually observe a response (sense) and respond accordingly. Amplify and
diminish/mute/kill accordingly.

But you need to be able to move quickly, deliver value continuously, learn and
experiment, and fail safely. “Our team can’t do that!” you say. That’s a
problem. When your ability to move and learn quickly is compromised, we are
forced to maniacally protect our resources. We MUST become clairvoyants. We
MUST try to do the impossible and look into our crystal balls and correctly
predict the future of a complex adaptive system (hard/impossible). You can
only do that when your horizon is very short, and you are moving quickly.

We then have a self-fulfilling prophecy … because we’re weak, we impose a way
of working that discourages ever becoming good at our weakness! The feature
Tetris / factory starts up, and your team never learns how to iterate and
progressively add value to a value stream. Worst of all, teams become overly
reliant on receiving a prescriptive idea/solution vs. aggressively tackling a
problem to solve, failing, and learning.

And that’s where I’ll stop for the day. Are your planning and estimation
efforts actually adding value? Do they “work” (outside of assuaging internal
fears, and aligning everyone’s cognitive biases)? Are they _really _necessary?
If you’re firing on all cylinders and doing all that stuff, well awesome! If
not, is this a chicken and egg problem?

### PMs: How To Make Sure You Aren’t Wasting Everyone’s Time

Product managers, here’s an easy way to see if you are wasting your own time,
and the time of the people around you. First, buy a watch so you don’t get
distracted by screens whenever you have to know the time.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*74Y05eVGrXYfMBbe5wCkrw.png)

Next, ask yourself “**what am I _REALLY_ doing?**” This can be harder than it
sounds, but go figure it out.

Then ask …

Does [that thing you’re doing] help **your team** (and the **individuals on
your team, _you included_**):

  1. [Build trust and reduce fear](https://www.infoq.com/articles/modern-agile-intro)? (see also [here](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/))
  2. Make it [safer to experiment](http://cognitive-edge.com/methods/safe-to-fail-probes/) and move with conviction and speed?
  3. [Achieve a flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29)?
  4. Leverage their diverse perspectives, habits, and quirks for mutual benefit?
  5. Work through conflict and become stronger?
  6. See the impact (and feel pride) in their work?
  7. Continuously deliver[ validated value (outcomes)](http://blog.leandog.com/2015/12/ux-design-peopes-over-output/)to your customers and organization?
  8. Add [as little as possible](https://www.agileconnection.com/article/art-maximizing-work-not-done) to your product for the greatest validated impact?
  9. Learn more about your users/customers/organization/larger ecosystem?
  10. Accelerate the rate of meaningful feedback and the ability to act on that feedback?
  11. Build a rich shared understanding applicable to the challenge at hand?
  12. Practice their [sensemaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensemaking) skills?
  13. Discover new opportunities to deliver value as they emerge?
  14. Think beyond incremental changes? Think big and shoot high?
  15. Reflect on what is and isn’t working and continuously improve?
  16. Hone their craft and branch out professionally?
  17. Work sustainably, with fewer fire-drills?
  18. Eliminate unhelpful dependencies and process, especially when rooted in mistrust and fear? Dampen the musty stink of internal politics, cognitive dissonance, and “just because”ism?
  19. Have fun and laugh?

What did you come up with?

**No. None of that!** Then you can stop doing that. See, that wasn’t hard! Do something else.

**Yes and No. I’m worried it has some positives, but also some undesirable side effects. **Figure that out. Take your hesitation seriously. Your behavior may not be safe.

**By golly yes!** Rock on. Keep it up, and reflect on whether it’s working with your team.

### 10 Ways UX Research Is Changing

How is UX Research evolving with the times, especially given approaches like
LeanUX that favor fewer handoffs, more participation, and more
experimentation?

It is Sunday, and the listicle (and doodle) instinct is strong ….

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*srLo60TVu2IaQWn3KcBJfg.jpeg)

See #1, #2, and #4 below …

  1. **Pull based, just-in-time research**. Spending weeks and months accumulating research is an accident waiting to happen. The environment is constantly changing. The danger of accumulating research inventory is that it is constantly _depreciating_. A small change in direction can render it stale and useless. Yes research takes time, but it is best to start at the [last responsible moment](https://dzone.com/articles/lean-tools-last-responsible). The ultimate just-in-time approach is to resist trying to “get ahead” of the work altogether and wait until there is capacity and time to start alongside the team. 80% of the value can be delivered quickly, and you’ll have 100% of the current context. What you find in many companies is a strange sort of neurotic design team driven shotgun research approach. They’re terrified they’ll get caught on the back foot or blow their “[seat at the table](http://firstround.com/review/How-Designers-Can-Earn-a-Seat-at-the-Table-2/)”, so they undertake all sorts of pre-emptive research that fails to ever synchronize effectively with front-line teams.
  2. Research is **validated continuously**. Is the research informing actual product decisions? I’m not talking assumptions — like putting one thing earlier/later in a roadmap, an ooh-ahh session for a two-year mobile plan, or a slicker kick-off deck — I’m talking about actual decisions on what was designed, built, and validated (customer-delivered value). Did your research findings hold water when validated out in the real world, with real data, and real customers? It’s ironic that to support Agile product development teams, UX Research is frequently asked to work in a waterfall model. Don’t delay validating your work. Which brings us to …
  3. **Less linear product development process**. Look at any antiquated graphic of the product development process and you’ll see a big block for Design Research. That block exists **TO THE LEFT **of when developers start to write code. UX Research for modern software products is still heavily entrenched in practices that fit more appropriately with hard-goods, and agency-orchestrated product development. Learning is happening all of the time, and UX Research will always be pivotal in the learning process. We’re moving from project-based research to continuous learning.
  4. **Less research in a vacuum**. Take teams along for your learning journey and invite them to participate in activities. Share findings frequently and incorporate feedback. Regularly “synchronize” and reality check your progress. Build empathy by connecting teams directly with customers instead of presenting your findings as reports or briefs. In this model you play the expert, guide, and fellow learner.
  5. **Facilitation**. To support #4, you’ll need to become skilled at facilitating various activities with cross-functional teams. Most researchers I know are extremely good at relating to people. But they can be severely challenged when it comes to working with engineers and internal teams. It is easy to become beholden to your research, and approach the work from the standpoint of a missionary vs. a guide and coach. Study up on facilitation skills. Get to know the developer and product manager mindsets …
  6. **Lightweight presentations**. Since teams are involved directly in the research, it is less common to be producing slick presentations. It used to be that you’d find yourself in the spotlight rarely (and the research was a many month effort), so you needed to make it count. The goal is to communicate learnings, and since the learnings spend less time in “inventory” (see #2 above), there are fewer learnings to communicate in any single shot. Succinctly answer the questions that matter now. Less fluff.
  7. **Using both quantitative and qualitative data. **Teams expect researchers to use all of the data at their disposal, and these days (if you’re lucky) you’ll have access to a significant amount of quantitative data. What do your users actually do in your product? How do they navigate in the real world? What key features differentiate the population you’re studying? How can we augment personas (or jobs-to-be-done profiles) with actual data? What predicts low/high NPS? Are these really the “top tasks”? Gone are the days when the most a researcher would graph/analyze were the results of a five person usability test. I’d venture to say that the qualitative vs. quantitative schism is a non-issue. The two feed seamlessly into each other. To tell a good story and engage teams you need both.
  8. **Experiment Design**. As a researcher, your job isn’t relegated to pre-work, benchmarking, reviewing historical data for insights, and making a take-it-or-leave-it recommendation. You’ll be frequently involved in a dynamic work in progress, A/B tests, triaging feedback from newly released experiments, and validating your own research assumptions in real-time. Experiment-design becomes part of the tool chest. This doesn’t mean that everything needs to be a rigorous, by the book, ready for a scientific journal experiment, but you can’t waste the team’s time.
  9. **A bigger research library to manage**. With the large amount of data available, you’re going to build a big war chest of raw data, information, and insights/knowledge. Data is coming in from various sources, and you have to organize it and make it accessible. Sure you can leverage tools, but there’s still a role for the librarian … especially when the library is big.
  10. **Evolving role of product managers**. I’ve written about [how product management is evolving](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/the-evolving-product-manager-role-6f288bbc3cda#.ol9l8038g), and the [many overlaps these days in product development](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/the-overlap-puxeng-56dcfd33875b#.bxs6hy54s). This draws the UX Researcher into the fray. For one, UX becomes an embedded team member, so you have your people in the fray, and you must support them. There’s less of a buffer. But I’m increasingly seeing that product managers are coming around to respect the various techniques used by UX Research. I’ve heard PMs say things like “so THAT’s how you do an interview!” or “these methods are not in my skill set, but I’m finding them incredibly helpful!” There’s a growing respect and overlap.

<http://www.kera.org/2014/07/22/delusional-perspective/>

  1. We can predict the future
  2. We can impersonate our customers
  3. The customer with the failed usability test is not representative
  4. The customer who loves the new feature is representative
  5. We’ll come back to it in a couple months
  6. Our roadmaps will remain accurate for more than a month
  7. The story is ready to be estimated as is
  8. No news from QA is good news
  9. By default, the team will feel comfortable giving you constructive feedback
  10. The customer will eagerly adopt the new feature
  11. Doubling the team size will double the output
  12. Apps are dead. The desktop is dead. Responsive is dead. [ — — — — ] is dead
  13. Sales understands how to sell the new feature
  14. We understand how to sell the new feature
  15. Product complexity scales linearly with number of personas serviced
  16. Eventually we’ll be able to leverage all of this data!
  17. It is “all about execution”
  18. Only you have (and need) the big picture
  19. We really have to make this backwards compatible
  20. Developers care mostly about clean code and bickering about PRs. They don’t care much for the impact of their work
  21. Customers will do all sorts of interesting things with our API, and we’ll have an easy time productizing all of it
  22. People will read your long, eloquent emails
  23. We’ll have advance warning before technical debt makes all forward progress impossible
  24. Crunch time is a healthy
  25. Usability doesn’t really matter in the enterprise
  26. This particular customer is representative. Build for them, and the rest will be easy
  27. The work we must do to close this deal “would have to be built eventually”
  28. The demo will work as expected
  29. We just need to “keep developers focused” and free from distractions, and everything will be OK
  30. We can just “put this product in maintenance mode” and shift all resources to something else
  31. If we give them too much freedom, the developers will “go rogue”. They need to be reigned in
  32. We know who our competitors will be in one year
  33. Developers disproportionately lack empathy
  34. Our idea is the best idea, our way is the best way, our design is the best design
  35. It is OK to tell the team a white lie to keep them on task
  36. Customers may suffer through the update now, but will see our genius later
  37. Being a jerk like Steve Jobs is a sign of genius
  38. Custom work can be easily productized
  39. We can start the next epic while feedback is trickling in from the last epic
  40. A developer without a story is wasting time

UPDATES (From comments)

41\. If we build it, they will come

42\. Sales doesn’t know what the customer wants

43\. An unhappy customer is just “the wrong type of customer”; we didn’t build
it for them anyway…

44\. There’s _nothing_ else we can do until we get a response on ________.
(best way to give yourself the break you earned! :D)

45\. We’ll release n-features on X-date!

46\. It’s easy, we don’t need any FAQs/documentation.

47\. It’s obvious, we don’t need user testing.

48\. There are a lot of things users don’t like. Rather than fixing each one,
we should just re-architect it.

### Your Saas Company Is Like a Theme Park

I’ve been toying with metaphors for a SaaS company. The more I mull it over,
the more SaaS companies start looking like service companies (or “experience
companies”). Products are touchpoints, and the whole complex system is
evolving and changing. Traditional product discovery methods aren’t well
suited to the non-linear nature of the system.

How about a Theme Park?

### 50 Questions I Ask PMs About Data and Their Teams

In my coaching work, I end up talking to lots of product development teams
about data, KPIs, running experiments, and “measuring the team”. People are
looking for the silver bullet:

> I’m also wondering if you’ve seen any good solutions to the product KPI
problem in general

My response is a typical, befuddled “it depends”. Why does it depend? I’ve yet
to find a one-size-fits-all solution. Goals vary. Products vary. Cultures
vary. Skills vary. The scope for possible actions vary. At at the end of the
day, cultivating a learning culture (a prerequisite in my mind for the
responsible use of data) isn’t something you install. That’s the blocker … not
some tool, technique, or having access to a data scientist.

Here is my backup list of questions I use when doing interviews and gathering
“data” on an organization before making any recommendations.

Use ’em if they’re helpful. Look before you leap, and gauge the organization’s
DNA. Then start the experimentation…

  1. How open is your culture to disconfirming information? Is it welcomed or fought? What would be the path from that disconfirming insight to an actual change in direction?
  2. Trying new ways of using evidence and data to drive decisions can be risky. Mistakes are common. How safe is your environment for teams that might make the occasional mistake in their quest to make better decisions?
  3. When it comes to using evidence to drive better product decisions, what’s working? Why is it working?
  4. Describe something new you have learned about your customers in the last two months. How did that learning come about?
  5. Describe a current blind spot. What do you know you _don’t know_? What might you accomplish if you could learn more in this area? What would you ask a crystal ball?
  6. Could you describe a recent ad-hoc report or analysis you generated? What questions were you hoping to answer, and what decisions were you hoping to inform? Can you tell me more about how you actually gathered, cleaned, and analyzed the data?
  7. Are you required to deliver regular reports to other parts of the organization? What do they look like? How frequently do you prepare these reports?
  8. Moving beyond the pros and cons of individual decisions, how does your team reflect on the quality of your product development decision making process?
  9. Describe some recurring decisions you must make, and how you leverage data to make those decisions.
  10. What does being “data-driven” actually mean to you? What is the opposite of being data-driven? Can an organization be customer-driven AND data-driven?
  11. If your teams could get faster feedback, what might that let them do? What type of feedback would drive these actions?
  12. Who is involved in your business intelligence efforts? Who do they report to? Who thinks about the big picture and handles cross-functional / cross departmental needs?
  13. Words like data, business intelligence, data science, analytics, insights, experimentation, and learning are thrown around often. Can you describe your personal mental model?
  14. How do your teams handle and explore ambiguity?
  15. Can you describe insights that exist elsewhere in your organization that are logistically difficult to incorporate/integrate with your product data? Why does this silo exist?
  16. “Fail fast” is one of those buzzwords we hear often. It inspires many reactions. What’s your reaction?
  17. What was your last flop? How did you figure out it was a flop? How long did you know it was heading in that direction?
  18. People often speak about “wrangling” data. Can you describe some recent struggles with getting data into a state suitable for analysis?
  19. How is decision making distributed across your organization? When the Why for a particular decision involves data and evidence, how is that communicated?
  20. An engineer once asked me if there were “passing tests” for product managers. From the PMs perspective, how would you describe the “passing tests” for your work?
  21. What are some common adoption patterns for new features in your product? What dictates the uptake?
  22. How do you go about understanding the impact of newly shipped features?
  23. What can’t data tell you? What are some of the intangibles that are driving your product decisions?
  24. Who has access to your product data? How do they access that product data? If they produce some sort of insight — a graph, a dashboard, a report, an analysis, etc. — how do they share that internally?
  25. Some common themes associated with data include: control, learning, efficiency, resourcing, performance management (measuring people), and innovation. What’s at the heart of your efforts? What’s your motivation? What will become possible?
  26. Do you have monitors in the office with product metrics? Or a dashboard that is widely and passionately consumed? What’s on it? What’s the story on how that dashboard came to be?
  27. What is your current weak-spot in terms of using data and evidence to drive better outcomes? Where is there friction and hiccups? What’s stopping progress?
  28. Describe some of the longer term trends in your product. What have you been tracking for some length of time? When will it reach an inflection point?
  29. How do your teams leverage existing product data during the design process? Can you describe a recent design decision that was informed by benchmark data and insights?
  30. How might someone internally get a quick snapshot of your product’s health? How would you know if something was going wrong, especially if it was a longer term trend that might not be immediately apparent.
  31. Does your team trust the data it has? When is trust lacking? Where is there confidence?
  32. How has data and measurement been inadvertently abused in your organization?
  33. How do teams share their insights? Where would I go to learn about recent learnings?
  34. If presented with data showing poor adoption or that the work was not driving the desired outcome, what action might your team take? Who would make that decision?
  35. Who is the most data-savvy person you work with? What can they do that others cannot do?
  36. The word “experiment” can mean different things to do different people — especially in the business context. What does it mean to you? Can you give some examples from your organization?
  37. Sometimes it is OK to guess. Other times, not so much. Describe a recent situation where it was decidedly NOT ok to guess, and explain how you went about gathering the facts.
  38. Describe a metric you refer to on a daily or weekly basis. What does it mean? Why is it important?
  39. Can you give a recent example of a situation where your team’s intuition was proven wrong? How did that unfold?
  40. The “intuition vs. data” debate is a frequent one. Have you observed this in your organization? How did it play out?
  41. How is your personal performance measured?
  42. In your opinion, what makes a product successful?
  43. In your opinion, what are the traits of a high-performing product development team?
  44. What are you thoughts on the phrase “learning organization”? How do you personally balance learning and execution?
  45. What leeway do your teams have for shipping, analyzing the data, and acting on that information before taking on new work? How quickly are they called on to the next task?
  46. How do you segment your customers and users? Who uses these segments internally? How does your segmentation scheme manifest in how you work, prioritize work, make decisions, etc.?
  47. What traits do your most valuable customers have? How do you prioritize your customer success and customer support efforts when in a pinch?

### Acute vs. Chronic Product Issues

In his post [**Normalization of deviance in software: how broken practices
become standard**](http://danluu.com/wat/)**, **Dan Luu** **makes an
interesting point about postmortems:

> If there were an acute failure, you might see a postmortem, but while we’ll
do postmortems for “the site was down for 30 seconds”, we rarely do
postmortems for “this takes 10x as much ops effort as the alternative and it’s
a death by a thousand papercuts”, “we architected this thing poorly and now
it’s very difficult to make changes that ought to be trivial”, or “a
competitor of ours was able to accomplish the same thing with an order of
magnitude less effort”.

It’s a great post — I highly recommend it — but this section in particular
struck a chord with me. We tend to discuss and analyze our acute failures and
celebrate our big wins, but rarely find a way to constructively discuss our
chronic challenges and areas of barely acceptable mediocrity.

It’s like someone delaying dealing with a chronic health issue (or a screwed
up relationship or work situation), but promptly visiting the ER when
something “bad” happens.

A friend echoed a similar situation in their organization:

> Somehow we persuaded ourselves it was OK to work with the broken
architecture. We’d churn features out. Have little parties. Pat each other on
the back for a job well done, even if we didn’t know if the work was actually
successful. And just turn a blind eye. Anyone who tried to push for change was
simply marginalized, and singled out as not being a team player

In Lean you have the concept of a stop-the-line culture ([pulling the Andon
chord](http://www.shmula.com/about-peter-abilla/what-is-andon-in-the-toyota-
production-system/)). Here was a person doing just that — developers were
struggling due to the architecture — but she was marginalized for speaking up.
Now, this wasn’t a critical issue. The lights were on, and the product was
accessible. But this kind of stuff adds up. The same goes for delivering
mediocre features, letting UX debt accumulate, letting learning/cognitive debt
accumulate, or allowing toxic behavior. You can celebrate your wins all you
want, but it doesn’t make this stuff go away (or make discussing it safer).

In this particular situation there were a couple interrelated problems:

  1. A feel-good, harmony focused culture. Talking about chronic problems was frowned upon (vs. acute issues that could be addressed immediately). Most cultures (not just feel-good cultures) find that discussing chronic, wicked problems is difficult for both managers and the front-lines. Typically, they are bigger and require more resources to address
  2. Let’s assume that management had very good reasons why they couldn’t address this issue … if they did, they weren’t discussing them. This lack of communication and acknowledgment was toxic
  3. New developers assumed this was just how it worked
  4. More experienced developers didn’t see an upside in calling out the issue repeatedly because of #1
  5. Because of #2, there was no basis for a straightforward discussion on what might trigger a response. IOW, how bad would it need to get before acting? How would you measure that?

So what can you do?

Luu [cites a couple recommendations from a study detailing normalization of
deviance in
healthcare](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2821100/):

> Pay attention to weak signals

> Resist the urge to be unreasonably optimistic

> Teach employees how to conduct emotionally uncomfortable conversations

> System operators need to feel safe in speaking up

> Realize that oversight and monitoring are never-ending

All of this advice applies for software. If you accept the new normal as
normal … then you quickly lose the fire for addressing the chronic issues.
They multiply. And suddenly you are struggling with the non-linear effects of
those issues. While retros and postmortems target the acute issues that
account for 20% of your hurt, you are stifled by the chronic issues accounting
for 80% of your hurt.

You might not be able to address the problem immediately, but you must
encourage your teams to monitor the issue without discounting their
frustration. For example, developers could cut new tickets each time they had
to work around the finicky architecture, or use product usage metrics to
indicate the impact of UX debt.

Anyway. [Check out Luu’s post.](http://danluu.com/wat/) It’s good. And think
about how you can make your environment safer for monitoring and discussing
chronic issues.


# Cutting Corners and Electric Fences

Your team ships a new feature. Something is not right.

* * *

### Cutting Corners and Electric Fences

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0wdqFy2-c9zCBobJVoxZSQ.png)

<http://www.grit.com/animals/electric-fencing-basics>

Your team ships a new feature. Something is not right.

You’re worried about the test and monitoring/analytics coverage. The
developers weren’t able to refactor some crappy code, which made things take
longer. The uptake isn’t what you expected, and it looks like users are
struggling with the workflow (but you having trouble parsing the details,
because of the poor monitoring). It feels shoddy, and as someone who cares
about doing good work this bothers you. The ensuing success theater — with
sales and marketing in full pitch and sell mode — just makes things worse. It
starts to gnaw on you and you find yourself being uncharacteristically testy.
Someone has to say something, right?

Tactfully, you mention your concerns during a 1:1 chat with a manager. It
doesn’t go well. She responds:

> We can’t be perfectionists! We have to get stuff out there and be _Agile_.
Sales is killing it with this! Users might be struggling, but let’s be honest,
they’re not our customers. They don’t pay our bills. We also have a great
support team to smooth things over. All I’m asking here is that you focus on
what you can control, and on being a team player. I’ve noticed you being more
negative lately. I bet the team doesn’t appreciate that! They worked hard on
this. They might think you’re undermining their work. Be careful …

Biting your lip, you mull things over in your mind. That’s a lot to process.
The conversation feels manipulative on many levels, but perhaps you’re not
seeing something. You know that’s not the definition of Agility, but that’s
the least of your concerns. The questions flow: Was the work in vain? Am I
just naive? Are my standards too high? Is it better to just go with the flow?
Maybe she knows something I don’t know?

You think about your significant other and your apartment in the Bay. The
company isn’t burning, and you’ll likely have this job for at least the next
couple years. It is decently fun, the people are nice, and there’s a chance
things might work out.

Does she know something you don’t know? That last question inspires you:

> Thanks for the, err, advice. I appreciate it. I understand that at times we
need to cut corners. It would just help, to, you know, feel like there was a
good reason we were cutting those corners. Like there was an upside. Or at
least to be transparent about the risks we’re taking. We’re making a bet that
it doesn’t matter, for now. We’re making a bet that we don’t need to do our
best work, and that this will pay off in the future. Let’s at least make that
explicit. I’m willing to roll with it. How will we know when it is the
right/wrong bet to make?

There’s a pause. Now put yourself in the shoes of the manager. Someone is
asking her to:

  1. admit that the best work is not happening
  2. admit that this is impacting someone who cares, and
  3. be explicit about risk, and agree to be called out on her decisions at some point in the future.

And all the while she is likely dealing with the same cognitive dissonance
from her boss, and her boss’s boss.

It’s like asking someone to acknowledge that:

  1. smoking is not the best choice
  2. second hand smoke is harmful to friends and family
  3. they’re making a calculated decision that not quitting now will serve some future good for everyone

Based on my chats with my mom (a smoker of 60 years), that doesn’t work. The
response is predictable: defensive, dismissive, mildly threatening, and brief.
Meeting (or lunch with mom) over.

* * *

I’ve fallen for this trap dozens of times. It _ALMOST NEVER_ works. You’re not
going to get the clarity you’re hoping for. Sure you’ll get clarity about
everything else — what’s in the backlog, sales numbers, the fancy methodology
you’ll be adopting, your managers plans, etc. — but you won’t get the level of
transparency and vulnerability you desire. [Larman’s Laws of Organizational
Behavior](http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/index.php?title=Larman%27s_Laws_of_Organizational_Behavior)
gives us some clues. The third point especially:

> any change initiative will be derided as “purist”, “theoretical”,
“revolutionary”, “religion”, and “needing pragmatic customization for local
concerns” — which deflects from addressing weaknesses and manager/specialist
status quo.

Now, it is easy to make this about middle management. Often, however, they are
merely _caught in the middle_. They’d love to have good answers for you, but
the strategy they’re getting is equally as obtuse. To Craig Larman’s point,
handling these wicked problems typically triggers a litany of arguments meant
to basically shut you up and calm the cognitive dissonance (theirs and yours).
These talks literally hurt the manager’s head and make them feel helpless and
out of control.

So what do you do as someone who cares and wants to do great work?

To fight this battle, you’re going to need to be quiet and carefully observe.

  * Where is the invisible border management has created around continuous improvement? I like to call this the electric fence: the border that seems to trigger the defensive reaction. Even organizations that pride themselves on “radical candor” have these fences scattered around
  * What issues come up over and over, but somehow always trigger the localized “pragmatic” response? Check annual surveys, retros, and post-mortems. What do people keep bringing up, but simply stop complaining about?
  * What is your organization optimized for at the moment? Draw out the system
  * What is the _real _culture as [evidenced by actions](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/company-culture-is-44592c36958c), not words?

After you’ve observed for a while, ask yourself the hard question. Are you
ever going to do your best work in your current role? Change rarely happens
because one person goes on a mission. Canaries die (that’s the point). Is this
a place where you can be challenged, and feel like you’re doing great work?

Still willing to give this place a chance?.

  * Don’t waste time having conversations with people who will be paralyzed by discomfort. Instead, focus on how to create safe situations where people can talk about this stuff without tripping the electric fence and causing defensiveness. Achieve that first, then have the conversations that matter. If you find yourself in a spokesperson role without other advocates at your side, you are likely going to fail
  * Visualize impacts, don’t talk about impacts with generalities. Basically … show, don’t tell
  * Talk about your own needs (e.g. “I have a need for more rigor here”) vs. grafting your needs onto the rest of the team, or speaking generally about a fucked up situation. Speaking generally fires the stress response
  * Consider that we often focus on the corners we cut, because there is nothing positive happening to counteract that crappy feeling. These are two distinct problems: 1) things are awesome because we’re cutting corners, but we’ll pay for it later, and 2) we are cutting corners now, and things are not awesome. Both are challenging, and attract a different response from those on the front-lines. In most cases, someone is aware that corners are being cut. The danger of things being awesome, is that we discount those cut-corners altogether. When we’re craving awesome, we make up all sorts of excuses why it’s necessary to cut corners (without admitting that we’re in this mess because of prior corners cut). So both are dangerous.
  * Try to take the emotional sting out of the word “bet” and use it! _Bet _is an interesting word. In a safe to fail environment we are free to make bets, including those that might involve cutting some corners. In a culture of fear, the idea that you’re betting the company’s money by doing less-than-great work is not to be discussed. Socialize the word “bet” in a safe way so that it has the potential for changing the mindset
  * Set an example. You aren’t going to get that manager to be transparent about their calculus. But you can discuss your own bets, and be humble when things don’t pan out

The big point here is that in these situations it is not just about speaking
up. The reaction you trigger can often circumvent your cause. By all means
encourage an environment where uncomfortable and challenging discussions can
happen. Encourage safety. But realize that candor alone wont destroy those
electric fences. That may take more time, and more strategy. Or you simply
finding another place to work.


# Case Study: From The Front Lines

Keeping people in the loop without it sucking

* * *

### Case Study: From The Front Lines

#### Keeping people in the loop without it sucking

How do you give big picture visibility to 12+ individual teams (100+ devs, UX,
PMs, Agile Coaches, etc.) without stepping on people’s time, or instituting
stuffy process? Below I share how I tackled this problem with decent results.
Perhaps it can inspire an experiment within your large product development
organization.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xBQpQAnUHrV6Ro3bdJsumw.jpeg)

#FTFL … blurred for confidentiality reasons, which has scaled to 20+ teams

#### **Organization**

Large, B2B SaaS organization

#### **The Problem**

  * **Visibility**. Teams had low visibility about what was happening across the product development org. This meant that the people who might have some helpful information to share — “hey, I know about that part of the codebase” or “I have some helpful customer data about that” — had no trigger to share that information
  * **Second Hand Information**. Product managers were tasked with reviewing the full near-term roadmap with their teams. Engineers found this to be a waste of time. I’m not sure if it was the timing, or the content (the information was secondhand), but it didn’t work, and some teams stopped the ritual
  * **Celebrate Wins**. While teams would ring gongs to celebrate a success, it was hard to keep track of the wins across the org. Teams periodically shared updates in lunch-and-learns (which was awesome), but time constraints limited the frequency of these meetings
  * **Management skeptical / resistant** I briefly tried having an epic-focused Kanban board. Management was highly resistant of any kind of work visualization spanning all teams. Their argument was that extra process might diminish team autonomy (very justified), and that visualizing the upstream “team tetris” (assigning epics to teams) might turn contentious (which it did, largely because teams did not choose their epics, and there were frequent team changes). Their concerns were valid

#### **Experiment Criteria**

I was pretty skeptical about having an impact. Previous efforts to make work
visible — with a single epic board, for example — were unsuccessful. People
were sensitive about wasting team time. No one cared for “Status Checks”… it
wasn’t that kind of culture (that’s good in my book). Teams didn’t have access
to the roadmap tool. So I knew whatever I tried needed to be:

  * Relevant
  * Be first-hand: come directly from the people on the front-lines
  * Easy and fast to update
  * Easy and fast to read
  * Not objectionable or threatening in any way to management
  * Not require an extra login

#### **The Experiment**

I nominated a “correspondent” on each team. I focused on developers because
they were closest to the actual work, and I wanted the content to be relevant.
I posed these guidelines:

  * This is an experiment that will likely fail, but I value your help
  * We’ll do this every other Wednesday. I’ll remind you on Mondays
  * You are the correspondent. I want the story “from the front lines”
  * The story shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes to write. Full stop! We are talking 1–3 tweets total. Not a book
  * This isn’t a status check. You can mention inane things, odd things, technical challenges, failures, new team additions … anything
  * The compiled version will take no longer than 8 minutes to read. The goal is to waste NO time
  * This is a purely voluntary role. If you get sick of it, you can pass it along
  * If you had no update (no delta from the previous post), just put “no update”

#### **First Try**

I created a Google doc with a slot for each team update, and shared it with
everyone. To my surprise, people played along. The updates came streaming in.
I needed to gently remind a couple people, but they thanked me sincerely for
the reminder. When they were done I scrambled for a title. The first thing
that came to mind was “From The Front Lines #FTFL”. I later found out what
#FTFL actually meant, but it was too late.

Title in place, I PDFed the thing. For some reason I thought it would be
easier to process (and focus) if it was a PDF. I also wanted to make it
printable. After putting it in a shared folder, I sent a quick email/Slack
blast. #FTFL1 was born!

#### **Feedback**

The feedback was (mostly) positive. A middle manager claimed it “wasn’t
scalable” to which one of the correspondents replied that “the old way wasn’t
scalable either, so this is worth a try.” Product Management felt stepped on.
They wanted to communicate status and felt uncomfortable. They grumbled. But
the overwhelming feedback was positive, and it was game on. We kept it up.
Correspondents would rotate. The issues kept rolling. It read like a community
newsletter with quick, accessible blurbs that made you feel closer to the
teams.

It was heartwarming to see the response among those on the front-lines and
other folks in the org. Two conversations in particular stood out. The first,
when the CTO thanked me for putting it together. Apparently, it allowed him to
briefly scan what was happening. The second, when a senior remote employee
(one of the first hires at the company) thanked me. It brought him closer to
the teams and areas where he could help. I never heard from middle-management,
but that’s another story.

A couple days before I left the company I “handed it over” to my good friend
Sarah, hoping the tradition would be kept alive.

#### **Update**

I learned recently that it is still going, almost 16 months after I started
it, and 12 months after I left the company. The basic format was still in
place — PDF, printed, separated by team — though UX had taken a stab at
beautification. How unexpected and cool! How many times do people complain
about “not seeing the big picture”, try some kind of “update” scheme, and the
whole thing falls apart? All the time, at least in my experience. So this was
a team effort, and a win.

I think this worked for two key reasons:

  * Our heart was in the right place. This wasn’t a status update for management. The goal was to create something valuable for the front-lines, not waste their time
  * We respected people’s time — both the readers and the writers
  * It was a bottom-up effort, and participation was voluntary

Who knows. It might fade away, but it was a fun thing to be part of. Give it a
try! If you’d like to chat about how to set this up in your org, just drop me
a Tweet at @johncutlefish or connect on LinkedIn


# Visualizing Debt, Rework, Cut Corners, and Frustration

Making the invisible visible lets you inspect and adapt

* * *

### Visualizing Debt, Rework, Cut Corners, and Frustration

#### Making the invisible visible lets you inspect and adapt

Your team is cranking through stories and hits a wall. Perhaps you’ve hit an
area of technical or UX debt. Or you’ve encountered a learning void and the
customer need is unclear. The going gets tougher. This is perfectly normal …
we’ve all been there.

A single story can involve a good deal of “work”: rework, working around
technical debt, research, usability testing, and experimentation. These tasks
exist on a customer-value spectrum. Research very much contributes to customer
value (your customers would be psyched to see you learning more about their
needs). Working around technical debt that you’ve continuously kicked down the
road … not so much. What we DON’T work on is also important. Suppose you cut
some corners to deliver early, all the while knowing you’ve delivered
something brittle and in need of eventual improvement?

Again, all of this is perfectly normal. We intuitively know we’re adding risk,
cutting corners, and working in less than ideal ways. Trouble starts to brew
when you stop reflecting and learning (see my post [Cutting Corners and
Electric Fences](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/cutting-corners-and-electric-
fences-c8fbfaa4d91a)). The trick is to visualize the impact.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uyGVPNpn8GJ6EigIU6o6Kg.png)

  1. If an engineer is battling technical debt to finish a story, then cut a ticket for that work
  2. If you ship a feature with obvious UX debt, then cut a ticket for this debt
  3. If research is required because no data existed, cut a ticket
  4. Is the work not contributing to customer value, but needs to happen? Cut a ticket
  5. Did you rush to get a story out and then need to play whack-a-mole with bugs? Cut a ticket
  6. Have you failed to validate the impact of a story? Cut a ticket for the research
  7. You get the idea. You’re creating more work, doing rework, cutting corners, punting, working around something …. doing something feels a little less than awesome. Cut a ticket.

I know, I know … that’s a ton of tickets. But without the ability to visualize
the work, waste, and rework, it can be difficult to reflect on that work,
waste, and rework. In my experience, this is inherently uncomfortable for
teams. We’re used to managers bullying us for estimates, measuring teams by
looking at velocity (not outcomes), getting scoffed at for mentioning
technical and UX debt, and being told to “be a team player” and accept shoddy
work. That’s NOT ok, and it insults teams. Our gut response is “no more
tickets”.

True story. I remember talking to a CTO who did a lot of rework / refactoring
“out of band” (not represented by tickets) just to avoid the scrutiny of the
product team and CEO. Meanwhile, the CEO was wondering why progress was so
slow. How dysfunctional!

Turn it around….

Instead, consider a radical approach for quantifying impact. More tickets.
More details. More awareness on the part of the team. More diligence in
documenting areas of debt. More safety, trust, and reflection. Less low level
“why doesn’t anyone see what I see” stress. At the end of the day, most
knowledge workers have a good radar. Engage that to make the invisible
visible.

### 12 Signs You’re Working in a Feature Factory

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*A9HaI7x2MdvkTn48D9a0wg.jpeg)

I’ve used the term _Feature Factory _at a couple conference talks over the
past two years. I started using the term when a software developer friend
complained that he was “just sitting in the factory, cranking out features,
and sending them down the line.”

How do you know if you’re working in a feature factory?

  1. **No measurement**. Teams do not measure the impact of their work. Or, if measurement happens, it is done in isolation by the product management team and selectively shared. You have no idea if your work worked
  2. **Rapid shuffling of teams** and projects (aka Team Tetris). Instead of compelling missions or initiatives, teams deal in feature and project assignments. Chronic multitasking and over-utilization
  3. [**Success theater**](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/success-theater-b60a1666fe67#.5zjj95jy4) around “shipping” with little discussion about impact. You can tell a great deal about an organization by what it celebrates
  4. **Infrequent (acknowledged) failures** and scrapped work. No removed features. Primary measure of success is delivered features, not delivered outcomes. Work is rarely discarded in light of data and learning. Often the team lacks the prerequisite safety to admit misfires
  5. **No connection to core metrics**. Infrequent discussions about desired customer and business outcomes. Team cannot connect work to key business and customer satisfaction metrics. Impossible to connect iterations to “what matters most”
  6. **No PM retrospectives**. Product managers do not conduct regular retrospectives on the quality of their product decisions and compare expected benefits to actual benefits. Developers have “passing tests”, but product managers do not. Product managers view velocity and output as their key performance indicator
  7. **Obsessing about prioritization**. Mismatch between prioritization rigor (deciding what gets worked on) and validation rigor (deciding if it was, in fact, the right thing to work on). Prioritization rigor is designed exclusively to temper internal agendas so that people “feel confident”. Lots of work goes into determining which ideas to work on, leaving little leeway for adjustments and improvisation based on data. **Roadmaps show a list of features**, not areas of focus and/or outcomes
  8. **No tweaking**. Once work is “done”, the team moves immediately on to the next “project”, leaving no time to iterate based on qualitative and quantitative data
  9. **Culture of hand-offs**. Front-loaded process in place to “get ahead of the work” so that items are “ready for engineering”. Team is not directly involved in research, problem exploration, or experimentation and validation. Once work is shipped, team has little contact with support, customer success, and sales
  10. **Large batches**. Without the mandate to experiment, features are delivered in single large batches instead of delivering incrementally. You might still work in sprints (yay, we’re “Agile”), but nothing new is reaching customers at the conclusion of each sprint
  11. **Chasing upfront revenue.** Features are implemented to close new deals. While not inherently wrong, the economic justifications are often flimsy (at best), and fail to account for the non-linear increase in product complexity (you make the quarter, but you pay for it many times over later). Again, this reinforces the idea that features are the unit of value measurement. Product decisions lack a sound economic grounding
  12. **Shiny objects**. Low visibility for refactoring work and debt work-down. Low visibility for overall value delivery capabilities. As mentioned, primary measure of success is new feature output. Little appreciation for the health of the whole product as opposed to shiny new objects. Little awareness around impact of new features on usability (and maintainability and extensibility) of existing product

# Success Theater …

I recently posted about Feature Factories ,which got me thinking about success
theater.

### **Success Theater …**

I recently posted about [Feature Factories](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-
youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2#.kjhkgs7aj) ,which got me
thinking about success theater.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yTlYkteVv_rV8wXqCY6Kmg.png)

Up and to the right …

There’s something about the phrase “success theater” that immediately hits
home. You just _know _what it means.

It’s hearing you hit the quarterly goal, but knowing [the corners you had to
cut](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/cutting-corners-and-electric-fences-
c8fbfaa4d91a) (and the people who will have to clean up the mess), listening
to someone rattle off vanity metrics that say nothing, but claim everything,
or being told you’re not a team player for having some doubts about a recent
“win”. It’s all optics and smoke and mirrors, and the experience sucks. To
anyone who takes their craft seriously, there’s no escaping that crappy
feeling.

It’s also seductive. Building stuff that people use and pay for (for real)
isn’t easy. It’s fraught with all kinds of setbacks and the reality is often
unfriendly. We want desperately for things to work, and need a small dose of
delusion just to keep going. But …

### Success theater undermines the long-term potential of your team (and
organization). It:

  * Dampens introspection
  * Fosters an environment unfriendly to healthy push-back
  * Gnaws at your most passionate team members (feels intellectually dishonest)
  * Insults the intelligence of your team
  * Sets you up for a rude awakening
  * Reduces safety and trust on teams (“I have to put on a smile, or else….”)
  * Locks you into keeping the illusion alive at all costs (the show must go on)
  * Puts optics ahead of your customers
  * Syphons your team’s valuable creative energy
  * Establishes a difficult to navigate dual reality
  * Deals in [vanity metrics not actionable metrics](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2009/05/19/vanity-metrics-vs-actionable-metrics/)
  * Makes it hard to filter out the “real” good news
  * Reduces the ability to detect weak signals
  * Discourages measuring what is really happening
  * Limits risk-taking and innovation
  * Leans on one group (or multiple groups) to deal with the reality

### That’s bad! But what can we do about it?

  * Lead by example. Once reinforced by leadership, success theater is very difficult to combat
  * Share some challenging news. Talk about missteps
  * When you have real wins, celebrate them like crazy. Have fun when the wins are real
  * Talk about failure and learning regularly (and respectfully)
  * Ask your team what success looks like to _them. _Get them involved
  * Ask your team to come up with actionable (and meaningful) metrics
  * Invite them to pick about the current metrics / units of success
  * Acknowledge (never dismiss) team feedback, and explain your rationale for doing or not doing something about it
  * Teach all team members about your company’s business model and operating assumptions. Regularly revisit those assumptions
  * Explain why targets/goals are what they are, and why it matters
  * Make it safe for someone to say things like “I’m not seeing why that’s a win ….” or “I really feel like we’re cutting the wrong corners”
  * Compensate/reward on performances and outcomes that matter, and that don’t cause divisions in your team. Rewarding success theater sets a terrible example
  * If optics matter to the external world — they usually do — have frank discussions on why that is the case, and how external messaging cannot dictate the internal dialogue


# Beat the Feature Factory — With Biz Chops

### Beat the Feature Factory — With Biz Chops

#### Buy the CFO lunch …

I’ll probably ending up writing a couple of posts focused on beating the
feature factory (see my post [12 Signs You’re Working in a Feature
Factory](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-
44a5b938d6a2#.5wrtg2rog)).

Yes, software product development teams (UX, Engineering, Product) need to
[get out of the building](http://www.inc.com/steve-blank/key-to-success-
getting-out-of-building.html). Equally important, is for everyone to **walk up
to the second floor** (or wherever “the business” hangs out).

**Arrange a meeting with your company’s CFO and/or CEO (I recommend the CFO because they tend to be less biased)**. Have them explain the moving parts in the business model, and the assumptions that underpin forecasts and growth targets. How do you _really_ make money, and what must remain true for you to continue to make money? What costs matter now? Why are sales goals what they are? Where does product _performance_ fit into the big picture?

To defeat the feature factory, the front-line must learn to speak the language
of the business _as well as_ the language of their craft. It’s the game you’re
playing. Resist all efforts to “protect and insulate” you from this
information. Be wary when told that the team “just needs to execute”. For a
great fictional example of how/why this works, read [The Phoenix Project by
Gene Kim, George Spafford, and Kevin
Behr](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AZRBLHO/ref=dp-kindle-
redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) .

I’m always amused when middle-manager business types are somehow surprised
(and even threatened) by the critical thinking skills of UX and software
developers. You can’t really blame them. Their worldview hinges on owning
this. But pushing back with vague discomfort and pleas for craft will fall on
deaf ears. You’ll need to talk the language of the business. For example …

  * “If we continue to iterate on this existing feature we can achieve that goal without having to fork the product. It’s worth our focus.”
  * “The work we’re doing is barely making a dent in that metrics.”
  * “If we accumulate this technical debt, we wont be able to meet those goals for new product development. I’ve observed the following leading indicators …”
  * “Churn will increase beyond your threshold if we don’t double-down on nipping this expectation mismatch in the bud.”
  * “We can still meet these sales goals if we choose to be more selective. Building feature on demand is a distraction, and I’ll show you why ….”

So set up an innocent meeting with your CFO. She’ll probably love the fact
that you’re going to be her second pair of eyes on the front-lines. Learn
everything you can, and then start looking for ways to drive outcomes and
commerce with craft. The two do intersect … you just need to understand the
landscape.

### Dear Product Managers …

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*s-ZwCwJVMPWQoodMRI42_A.jpeg)

We know your job is hard, but you need to let us help you. We’ve got the chops
and creativity, and want to help you, the team, the product, and our company
win.

There are a couple things on our mind that we would like to discuss. We’d do
this in person, but the last thing we need is another meeting.

We are curious. Is any of our hard work _really_ paying off for our customers
and business? Is it moving the needle? It might not seem like it, but we care.
When we know we’re delivering results, it is a little easier to stomach
releasing mediocre work, just shipping it, accumulating debt, and jumping to
the next project. Without some evidence that we’re making decent decisions,
those things add up. Frankly, we stop trusting you and stop caring.

Guessing is fine (we all do it). Guessing without reflecting is not fine.
We’ll never learn that way. Some of us are wondering whether continuing to
iterate and doing _better_ work might deliver even _better_ results?! Perhaps?

We need your help. The team is measured (officially or otherwise) every day:
uptime, defect counts, story point velocity, test coverage, hours spent
programming, acceptance criteria met, and stories and features shipped. But
none of these things indicate customer outcomes. It’s the opposite, actually.
Feature-bloat adds complexity, and complexity slows us down.Keeping us busy is
not the goal. Delivering outcomes is the goal.

We know you are under a lot of pressure to execute. You might have done UX or
development in the past, but you don’t now. You need us. Therefore, we’d
appreciate it if you treat us like partners, and not the construction and
assembly crew. Introduce us to actual customers. Let us contribute ideas. Let
us monitor and measure progress, and change course accordingly. Give us
context, and we will do good work.

Of course you don’t _need_ to do this — we can dutifully give you estimates,
and build your ideas to spec, and deliver things into the abyss — and this can
keep us interested for a couple months or years, but eventually we’ll move to
work somewhere else (the market is great these days). The company won’t notice
for a bit (hurray velocity!) but our customers will suffer, and the business
will suffer. We don’t want that, do we?

We respect your chops, instincts, perspective, and surreal ability to sit
through monotonous meetings. Let’s help each other do our best work, deliver
value to our customers, and build something we are all proud of.

Thanks

# Place Your Bets

Describing product (and company) strategy as a series of bets

### Place Your Bets

#### Describing product (and company) strategy as a series of bets

In recent posts [12 Signs You’re Working in a Feature
Factory](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-
44a5b938d6a2#.2jkk8hw2m), [Success Theater](https://medium.com/p/success-
theater-b60a1666fe67), and [Dear Product Managers](https://hackernoon.com
/dear-product-managers-c488ba6386ea), I discuss the resentment engineers and
UX feel when product managers fail to reflect on actual outcomes. Part of the
issue here is the challenge of building shared context and a shared
vocabulary. Words are powerful, and they matter.

I’m always on the lookout for more effective ways to talk about strategy
(especially in a way that resonates with the front-line). In this post, I’m
going to talk about the power of the word **_bet_**.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*p1UPrbUm4vGGayVmMBTylQ.png)

Old-school roulette (Wikipedia)

A couple months ago, I read an [interesting post by Henrik
Kniberg](http://blog.crisp.se/2016/06/08/henrikkniberg/spotify-rhythm) where
he shared [his
slides](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1018963/Projects/2016-05%20agila%20sverige%20spotify%20rhythm/Spotify%20Rhythm%20-%20Agila%20Sverige.pdf)
from a presentation at Agila Sverige. The slides describe Spotify’s current
strategic planning approach (aka Spotify Rhythm) and are worth reviewing.
Among all of the great nuggets, one thing in particular jumped out at me: the
use of the word _bet_. Over the years I’ve encountered Projects, Missions,
Initiatives, Epics, Objectives, Rocks, Boulders, OKRs, Experiments, and Goals
(and a bunch more I’m probably forgetting). But never Bets.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*z2NgaFBKcJXJ_bXDCbL0qQ.png)

Slide from Henrik’s presentation

So I tried Bets with teams (along with the DIBB framework he discusses, and
combined with missions and initiatives) and have become a fan. Bets are
versatile and fun to talk about. They capture that perfect interplay between
assumptions, desired outcomes, experimentation, risk, and reward.

Why does the word _bet _work?

  1. A bet can be tactical or strategic, prescriptive or descriptive. It can relate to what you’ll build, the problem you hope to solve, or what will happen in the marketplace (for example). It can range in scope from the core assumptions about the business to the outcomes of a small continuous improvement experiment
  2. Bets can be loose or strict. Business cases are typically “heavy”. Bets can be lightweight, or super structured
  3. Bets are by definition outcome focused. We bet that something will _happen_, and ask “how is the that bet working out?”. But they also suggest experimentation and learning
  4. By calling it a bet, we are admitting that “losing” the bet is an option. Somehow, even the word _experiment_ fails to prepare us for failure
  5. Bets have odds. Sometimes the odds are known, and sometimes they aren’t known
  6. There are big and small bets. This can be discussed in terms of very concrete costs, or in looser concepts like opportunity cost, distraction, fatigue of the team, intensity of work required, etc.
  7. Timeframe matters. When will we know if the bet paid off?
  8. Talking about bets will inevitably trigger good discussions around risk, information availability, learning, validation, and outcomes. They make good conversation pieces. They’re fun to talk about
  9. We explore the various implicit bets we are making (but not formally acknowledging). For example, by betting on enterprise customers (bet A) we may be implicitly betting on a longer sales cycle (bet B) and the ability to support enterprise customers with the existing support team (bet C)
  10. Bets force us to explore our “operating” assumptions and “universal truths” (what Knikberg called Beliefs and North Star / 2 Year Goals). My bet might be your validated truth. Or, I might have noticed signs from the market that a fundamental tenant of the business is now on shaky ground. If something is a sure thing (and almost nothing is), then it is no longer a bet
  11. By placing small bets (with a short timeframe) we can “buy” information that clarifies the odds for larger bets
  12. You can have a “portfolio” of bets, each with different risk profiles, hedges, etc. Discussing this with the team helps us frame our appetite for risk across the program/portfolio
  13. We consider the ideal number of concurrent bets (“bets in progress”). Taking too many bets at once can distract the team and in some cases teams will pursue clashing/competitive bets that reduce the odds overall
  14. Bets can be “nested” hierarchically and/or have dependencies. The company could have a big bet on an emerging technology which cascades into a number of smaller, more tactical feature bets

Check out Kniberg’s slides. Their framework may or may not be right for your
company, but the word Bet might still prove to be useful.

### Safety, Discomfort, and the Art of Self-Service Un***king

To quote [Joshua Kerievsky](https://medium.com/u/28229c304ac9) ‘s brilliant
[Modern Agile principles](http://modernagile.org/), you must “make safety a
prerequisite”. Without safety and trust, we rightfully resist change. When
safety is present, we relish the thrill of going outside of our comfort zone,
learning new things, exploring our limits, challenging our biases, and taking
risks. [People don´t resist change (only being
changed)](https://twitter.com/NielsPflaeging/status/793414761232928768).
According to Google research, [psychological safety is the key
predictor](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-
from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=0) of team success.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1BnJy3pTT-hrtx5tl53SJg.png)

<http://diving.about.com/od/forbeginners/a/getStarted.htm>

I’m always amazed when an executive bemoans the fact that her team won’t try
new things, only to hear about a culture of blame, retribution, and distrust.
Compare …

> Oh geez. Things are a mess right now, but in that exciting kind of way. I
don’t mind when my boss gives me a hard time and pushes me. It makes me better
at what I do, and I trust them. When I describe real blockers, he understands.
And he’s always straightforward. No duplicity

vs.

> When I’m not around, she talks shit about me. Always second-guessing my
work, and never letting me take risks. Also, it is almost like she is playing
a game with me: not letting me know if I’m doing a good job, and keeping me
guessing. It’s terrible. All I can focus on now is the immediate task at hand,
and doing what is asked of me.

Improvement requires safety, a modest amount of discomfort, time for recovery,
and time for reflection and learning. Discomfort can be a terrible experience,
or it can be exciting. It can destroy us, or serve as a signpost and catalyst
for better outcomes. [We feel
flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29) when we are
moderately challenged. In their quest for “harmony”, too many organizations
accidentally eradicate positive levels of challenge and discomfort.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_q7oLu6E0TlOiU8Wk3GC7Q.png)

A bit of brainstorming on high/low safety and high/low discomfort

Best practices are overrated. As a consultant, I very rarely say something to
my customer that hasn’t been said before by some members of their team. Those
team members might have given up on sounding the alarm, but they know what’s
up. Somewhere, in your org, are the ingredients for the solution. Not **THE
SOLUTION**, but the ingredients — the people, the context, the experience, and
the perspective — for progress to emerge. If process or knowing best practices
was your problem, you would have solved it already. I’m happy to think about
catalysts and attractors, but not “ways”.

Most of the rigor around change management and “transformation” is founded on
a fundamental (conscious or unconscious) underestimation of your people, their
resilience, and their desire to improve. The helicopter management that ensues
is part of the problem. That, and the delusion that you know the change end-
point.

Below I list 45 _potential _areas for experimentation. This list is _not
_prescriptive. It is directional. These are heuristics. They work because we
_tend_ to benefit from _some movement _in these areas_._

Take batch sizes. Yes, there is an economically ideal batch size for each
initiative. But we _tend _to work in batches that are too large, and ship too
infrequently. You could pull these out of a hat and experiment randomly if you
wanted. My bet is that a safe team trying things at random would vastly
outperform a prescriptive change management approach.

Random Experiments^Safety &gt; Best Practices^No Safety

Make it safe to go outside your comfort zone. Your goal is to try safe-to-
fail-experiments to move these needles and see what happens. The end-goal IS
NOT to move the needle, but rather to see what happens when and if you move
the needle!

Try (to):

  1. Ship sooner
  2. Ship more often
  3. Build less
  4. Release smaller batches
  5. Tweak and iterate more
  6. Remove more features
  7. Get feedback sooner
  8. More direct contact with the customer/user
  9. More direct contact with internal resources
  10. Gather more evidence of impact
  11. Be more obsessed about customer value
  12. Try more options
  13. Explore more novel solutions
  14. Be less prescriptive
  15. Commit later
  16. Converge and align later
  17. Less need for certainty
  18. Experiment more
  19. Broader mission and initiative scope
  20. Less prescriptive
  21. More slack
  22. More stepping away from the keyboard
  23. Less multitasking and context switching
  24. Fewer hand-offs
  25. Less rigid roles &amp; responsibilities
  26. More mobbing and swarming
  27. Fewer “transactional” meetings
  28. Less bureaucracy
  29. Less planning-in-progress
  30. Less planning-in-inventory
  31. Fewer dependencies and constraints
  32. Fewer phase-gates and approval steps
  33. Less focus on efficiency
  34. More transparency
  35. More off-sites and team bonding
  36. Invite more voices to the conversation
  37. More responsibility
  38. More team autonomy and ownership
  39. More opportunities to self-organize
  40. More trust
  41. Less success theater
  42. Less politics
  43. More authenticate celebration
  44. More time to pursue personal projects
  45. More time for professional development

### Startups and the Enterprise Vortex

I have a friend who recently wrote me with some questions about whether their
startup should “start selling to enterprises”. Sharing my response below.

* * *

I’ve found that startups get sucked into the enterprise vortex prematurely,
and not as a result of a premeditated strategy (although we pretend there is).
It “just happens”. Like most things, it feels right initially, and the costs
are less visible.

  1. Enterprise deals are enticing, but **they are a breeding ground for the sunk cost fallacy.** It’s hard to walk away from a deal you’ve spent ten months cultivating. What’s “right” for the company (and product) is routinely sacrificed for the “big deal” and short-term growth. This is rationalized, of course, but with flimsy, bias-driven arguments about reusability, strategy, and optics. Why exactly couldn’t you close five deals totaling the same amount with far less hassle?
  2. I’m all for a mid to later stage startup expanding into the enterprise, but only with _intention. _**Startups slip into an enterprise strategy, instead of really thinking it through**. In most startups that “go big”, the shift in direction is highly reactive. Deal size is too small. Smaller companies with limited budget don’t see immediate value in your product. There’s something structurally off in your approach. Instead of addressing those problems, you opt instead for the beauty of the big relationship sell. That becomes your salvation.
  3. **It is a self-fulfilling prophecy**. When you go big, you close big deals (if your product has a modicum of promise). You close big deals with entities that have lots of money to play around with and experiment. You are literally an experimental buy. Suddenly, your team reports “seeing traction with bigger customers, and the average deal size increasing”. Each quarter you bank on closing one or two of these to make the quarter. That manifests in rationalizing an enterprise approach. The question remains … did you really, really give the original approach a fair chance? A common excuse I hear is something like “well, our product is SO unique that it requires a high-touch approach”. Sometimes that is true. Oftentimes it says more about your implementation of the product. Simplifying the above. There are a million reasons why you’ll rationalize the shift into the enterprise. Attack each one. Have you given the less capital intensive, more organic, more product-centric approach a real shot?
  4. **“Land and expand” is another one of those things that looks great on paper, but it rife with bias**. All too often it is codeword for “let’s basically give away the product to a small department, deal with all the bureaucratic hassles, handle all sorts of custom requests and kid-glove them, and cross our fingers.”
  5. **(Many) enterprises are laggards.** This is a huge generalization, but the people who work in large orgs are typically less savvy, have less experience with modern tools, and are more easily impressed. They’re craving ANYTHING that works. Their IT departments are swamped. This is great on one level — they need help — but it also means you aren’t getting as many critical eyes on the product. Back to the generalization … some large companies behave like small companies. Are you targeting them also? Do you have traction there?
  6. **Attacking the enterprise is distracting and lengthens feedback loops**. The deals are higher touch. You need more people around to tie up the loose ends. There’s more cognitive dissonance. Suddenly, your CTO is spending half of their time completing massive security reviews. Most importantly, it becomes harder to see through the fog. It is more difficult to innovate, react, and pivot when 80% of your revenue is coming from six big players.
  7. **It is harder to go backwards**. The nature of org systems dictates that it is always easier to go up-market, than it is to structure your org around “going backwards” and offering a more mass market option. Targeting the enterprise impacts your organization in a way that is difficult to unwind, and even more difficult to run concurrently with a more self-service approach.

I mention this above, but the hardest thing to tackle here is that “going big”
is a self-reinforcing loop. It will challenge every fiber in your body once
you start tiptoeing in that direction. Start, and you will almost certainly
rationalize: enterprise reps, new biz dev hires, custom services, custom
training, customer-specific features, poor UX, and the customer/user dichotomy
(well, the people paying don’t use it so _______ ).

I realize how hard it is to be running on empty. It is terrible and scary. I
also realize how hard it is to resist the lure of big deals, and to resist the
cognitive biases that start to kick in. The best I can offer is to strategize
with intent, and to act based on experiments with sound experiment design.
Fight the urge as long as possible. I’m not saying it is “bad” or “good”, but
that startups _tend _to go that direction prematurely. There’s plenty of time
to tackle the enterprise.

### A 12-Step Program for Recovering Product Managers

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*txyuPaVi0r2IALW3zjwUqA.jpeg)

I frequently hear from Product Managers that want to break the vicious cycle
of the [Feature Factory](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a
-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2#.cyaqivj9x). You know it’s wrong for your team,
and your customers, but you can’t break free. Sometimes you question whether
product management is even the right profession.

Trust me. I’ve been there. There’s hope, and it all starts with you! It is
time to reaffirm your commitment to your craft.

Update (12/16/2016): I recorded a 45 minute video talking about the 12 points
and added shortcuts to each point below. My advice … read first, before
jumping into the video.

  1. **I WILL** accept my own [fallibility](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/40-lies-pms-tell-themselves-20be00570dc#.7ofz5sevq), and the power that cognitive biases have over my decision making ([2:35](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=155))
  2. **I WILL **work to earn the trust of the team, and commit to creating a safe environment that is friendly to taking risks, practicing our craft, and being transparent and honest ([5:20](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=320))
  3. **I WILL** refuse to make promises and commitments that impact the team, without first consulting with the team ([8:36](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=516))
  4. **I WILL** respect the fact that makers [need uninterrupted time](http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) to ponder, experiment, and build. I will make myself available at all times, but without interrupting and breaking the team’s flow ([10:10](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=610))
  5. **I WILL** focus on making ALL of the people in our ecosystem — [customers/users](https://vimeo.com/131407754), immediate team members, extended team members, “the business”, investors, and partners — awesome. Not through coercion, or manipulation, but by always experimenting with things that might allow people to do their best work ([11:55](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=715))
  6. **I WIL**L detach from my pet solutions (and the solutions offered by HIPPOs and customers), and focus instead on gathering data about problems worth solving. The team (with me as a member) will decide which problems and solutions are worth pursuing ([17:00](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=1020))
  7. **I WILL** shorten the distance between the customer/user and the team, and [resist the temptation to act as a go-between](https://medium.com/@JoshuaKerievsky/customer-obsessed-teams-dont-have-product-owners-7c20a01c195f#.yxdq0s9s1). Whenever possible, we will seek to let the customer represent themselves, and will refer to actual usage data in addition to what people say ([19:32](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=1172))
  8. **I WILL** work with the team to deliver continuous value (not features, or story points). When faced with big batches, we will work to decompose those batches, and deliver value (and learn) incrementally. With flow, many rituals (e.g. estimation) will fall by the wayside, and I will support the team’s decision to stop rituals that add no value. In terms of process, I will advocate for as little process as necessary to preserve safety, and challenge my own need for certainty and control ([23:10](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=1390))
  9. **I WILL** collaborate with the team to measure, iterate, and celebrate based on the actual impact of our work. We will fail often, but will leave sufficient time to learn from those failed experiments and deliver the best outcome possible ([28:16](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=1696))
  10. **I WILL** stop trying to “keep the team busy” at all costs, and will encourage the team to leave sufficient slack for personal projects, professional development, and having a life outside of work. Whenever possible, we will [keep utilization rates at a reasonable leve](https://hbr.org/2012/05/six-myths-of-product-development)l, and strive to deliver outcomes while at the same time “[maximizing the amount of work not done](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)” ([29:50](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=1790))
  11. **I WILL** respect the strong desire to [not cut corners](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/cutting-corners-and-electric-fences-c8fbfaa4d91a), and do whatever possible to promote the sound economics of “doing the job right” and/or committing as a team to address those cut corners at some point in the foreseeable future ([33:30](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=2010))
  12. **I WILL** reflect on the points above, seek feedback and coaching, accept and address my weaknesses, and continue to do what works (until it stops working). And I’ll take care of myself, meditate, and not become a stressed out / terrible person to be around ([36:25](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=2185))

I’ve recently become a fan of [Joshua
Kerievsky](https://medium.com/u/28229c304ac9)’s four [Modern Agile
principles](https://www.infoq.com/articles/modern-agile-intro) which dovetail
nicely with these 12 points. They are worth checking out if you are sick of
the “Agile industrial complex”.

# 110 Product Development Posts Later…

### 110 Product Development Posts Later…

#### Time flies when you’re figuring stuff out (and getting more confused)

Just realized … wow, 110 posts!

Writing on Medium is my way of thinking stuff through. It’s a messy process,
with lots of revisiting ideas, and a big dose of angst. Things got crazy in
the last 30 days with 200,000+ views (thanks Reddit, that’s it, I can retire),
but my expectations with any particular post are low. I expect it to flop, and
get pleasantly surprised when folks find it.

I love all things product development related. There’s something so powerful
about small groups of smart craftspeople building stuff, validating it,
tweaking/refining it, and delivering real value — not success theater — to
customers and the business. Naive? Maybe. But hey, we pick our path.

Medium oddly makes it hard to get a nice, clean list of your posts. So to
celebrate 110, here goes …

### 140 Product Management Action Verbs

I enjoy brainstorming words. It’s a weird habit. When describing our work, we
often talk in platitudes. Words jog our memory, and force us to think about
what we need and don’t need. What do you need? Do you need things that
inherently clash? Who can realistically do what?

Here is a [Google Sheet with the list of
words](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WHptwdv8uH_AJAgyptCCZFYSiLlj6eBV_qgkrUtZnA8/edit?usp=sharing).
Might be interesting to look at your PM job descriptions, and see how these
line up. Or revisit your resume.

Come Into The Woods: Melonie King

Today’s Thought: **Change agent myopia does not make people awesome**. It’s
easy to ignore how silly a lot of what we’re spewing actually sounds, unless
you’ve seen it work:

  * Why _wouldn’t_ we try to build more?
  * Why _would_ we let our engineers sit around and mob program all day?
  * Why _wouldn’t_ we try to speed up?
  * Why _wouldn’t_ we just design everything upfront?
  * Why _wouldn’t_ we try to keep our developers busy?
  * Why _wouldn’t_ we try to establish clear roles and responsibilities, clear lines of accountability, and efficient processes?
  * Why _wouldn’t_ we run a feature factory?

Context and work history dictates our perspective. I spoke recently with
someone who had focused on “the enterprise” for their career. They simply
couldn’t believe that other organizations targeted similar customers (size,
savviness, product complexity) but worked in entirely different ways. “You’re
***ing kidding me! No one brings a bunch of engineers on site to visit
customers!”

There are two ways to respond here:

  1. a dash of smugness, point to some books, insinuate their org is behind the curve, hype a buzzword methodology, reference a keynote talk on YouTube, or
  2. curiosity, empathy, and accepting the burden of proof.

The former fails to accept that what you’re pitching is likely highly
counterintuitive. It might have no connection to what this person has seen,
experienced, has been subjected to, and has tried in their career. The latter
invites an experimentation mindset.

I’ve attended — and sadly given — many talks where the upshot is “you’re
wrong, you are behind the curve, and there is a better way!” Peppered through
the talk are a list of symptoms everyone can relate to. The audience nods.
People laugh. People cry. They want to up their game!

But the reality is that only 5% of the people in the room have actually
_experienced _(and that is the critical word) or even observed the better way
of working. 15% have experienced some sort of watered down pragmatic variation
(see [Larman’s Laws of Organizational
Behavior](http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/index.php?title=Larman%27s_Laws_of_Organizational_Behavior)).
95% of the audience relates to the pain, but cannot relate to the path forward
on any visceral, non-theoretical level. And therein is the challenge. We are
complex animals, and we like quacking ducks and good stories.

Lasting change often follows a cataclysmic event. In a fit of existential
struggle, the organization flips the lever and launches into the new. You
could argue that change agents would, in many cases, be better served by
triggering an oh-shit threat, and just sitting back.

The other approach is to focus on running safe-to-fail experiments that let
people experience the new, and judge for themselves. Have empathy. Start with
where you are. Respect prior experience. And focus on experiencing the new in
with safety and trust.

### Untangling OKRs with a Big, Visual Board

_Note: A 1.3MB version of this imagine can be found
_[_here_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B04yoW1JFDHGak0tR0xGYllFM0E/view?usp=sharing)_.
I use the term OKR below. To learn more about OKRs see
_[_here_](http://eleganthack.com/the-art-of-the-okr/)_. I use a diagram (not a
photo) here for confidentiality reasons._

Do you use OKRs? Can you visualize the work of a 100–300 person company on a
single “board” ? I think so. With this format, I’m trying to address four key
problems:

  1. Visualizing how team-level goals and company goals interact
  2. Big batch planning
  3. Confusion over cross-team and team based goals
  4. Confusion over “we’d do that anyway” goals and powerful, mission-based goals

The most important characteristic of the board’s format is that it is
continuous. The leftmost column is always Month 0. As we move into the future,
there’s less room for detail. Month 0, the current month, is significantly
bigger than month 6. Vertical height constrains the number of cross-functional
objectives (Boulders) we can pursue at once. In this example it is a single
item. **The board is always kept up to date, and represents our current
reality. It is big, but that is what walls are for.**

I break down the elements below, but here is the board in its loveliness:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*pFgqAU8yrpJ2xC3tXiLHsQ.png)

The Board. _A 1.3MB version of this imagine can be found
_[_here_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B04yoW1JFDHGak0tR0xGYllFM0E/view?usp=sharing)_._

There are five swim-lanes on the board. Why five?

I’m a big fan of a singular focus. But in talking to teams, I noticed that
**financial goals** rarely have salience. These goals are seen as a leading
indicator of doing great things, but are not the _great things_ themselves. So
when picking OKRs, you always have this struggle over whether to include them.
It’s the same deal with health metrics. While important — you don’t want to
drive your company into the ground — they are something we monitor constantly.
So I lump those into a single swim-lane.

  * **Financial Goals &amp; Health Metrics**. Key monthly and quarterly financial goals such as revenue targets, sales targets, MRR, churn rates, average deal size, monthly burn, etc.

### What We Can’t See

Close a deal and money gets transferred into your bank account. That feels
real. Hire three new people and increase your burn by $50k per month… ouch!
That feels real too. If only our wins, risks, and losses were always so
salient.

The central problem is that the many of the costs we incur do not feel real.
The impact is barely felt, or misdiagnosed entirely. It’s not visible and
salient, like beating the quarter or closing a round. Suddenly you turn around
and it smacks you in the face, and there’s not much you can do to turn back
the tide. Or you see the dark clouds coming from miles away, but the various
remedies seem to further exacerbate the problem.

What can you do? Are we destined to get caught in these traps? Is the only
answer to spend our way out of it when the shit hits the fan?

I don’t think so. I think it takes awareness, and engaging the front-lines in
relaying their feedback. You have an org filled with “sensors”, and they are
capable of sensing the [drift into
failure](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10258783-drift-into-failure).
Plus, you can always do a better job of making certain costs more visible.
Just being open that these things exist can have a big impact. But you’ll have
to free your own mind, and start listening.

What types of costs and impacts are we looking for? We are looking for
movement/changes/vacillations in the following:

  * Cost of technical, UX, and instrumentation debt
  * Cost of leadership/organizational debt
  * Cost to communicate context/data with minimal signal loss across organization
  * Impacts on team morale and engagement
  * Impacts on resiliency, ability to adapt/adjust to changing context
  * Impacts on ability to pursue novel solutions / fortuitous accidents
  * Impacts on overall “efficiency” (velocity/headcount, etc.)
  * Cost of multitasking and context-switching
  * Cost to service diverse market segments, user personas
  * Cost to maintain increasing technical complexity
  * Cost to compete with smaller, yet more nimble competitors
  * Cost to document and support new functionality
  * Impacts on new skill attainment (professional development)
  * Cost of knowledge/skill silos
  * Cost to hire and onboard new team members
  * Cost of unrecognized, untapped human potential
  * Impacts on goodwill with customer/user communities
  * Cost to maintain integrations and partner relationships

### 50 Things I’ve Learned About Product Management

#### The Sunday, can’t sleep, had coffee after 2PM edition…

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qDSjH1hEIeCtnQm8jZchmw.jpeg)

It’s often the little things that count…

  1. You are wrong more often than you are right. The trick is getting a couple shots at solving the problem.
  2. Your company can do (almost) everything wrong, and still grow in the short and near term.
  3. You can do (almost) everything right, and not outrun the elephant in the room.
  4. Without a strong product vision, you’ll end up outsourcing product strategy to the rest of the company.
  5. Don’t hire product managers to be (mediocre) project managers. There are awesome project managers out there if that is what you need.
  6. The best way to get people off your back is to deliver value continuously (with data to back it up). Real results (and a proud team) eat everything for breakfast.
  7. Craft and commerce are not incompatible. Reckless growth and craft are incompatible.
  8. Passing the trash to other departments (e.g. “support will deal with it”) always comes back to bite you.
  9. Someone on your team has a better idea. Would you know?
  10. Shiny objects sometimes work. But shiny things always fade.
  11. To learn how to be a good PM, spend time working on a team with a great PM.
  12. Show — with data, stories, and examples — don’t tell.
  13. Driving out all uncertainty tends to drive out originality (and innovation).
  14. You tend to go where you look. If you look too hard at the competition you’ll go towards them, instead of towards point ahead of them.
  15. If you’re arguing about the impact of UX on the bottom line, you should probably consider working for a more forward thinking company.
  16. Everyone ends up hating the ticketing system. And the wiki. That’s partly because we overload our ticketing systems with extra process/metrics/junk, and no one actually contributes to the wiki.
  17. With user stories it’s the conversation that counts. Have the conversation!
  18. At some point you’ll have the benefit of the doubt. Make that count.
  19. When heroics become the norm, then only heroics will generate reasonable results.
  20. Before you send that canary-in-the-coalmine email, keep a journal for a week and reflect.
  21. If it’s not a good fit, leave before there are hard feelings.
  22. Is the product manager actually managing a _product_? If not, do you need a product manager?
  23. If the team isn’t inviting you to the retros, you’ve got to figure out why and fix that.
  24. All bets are off until someone is trying to use the feature with their data, in their environment, in their day to day work. You have to leave time to iterate based on that feedback.
  25. Sales will tell you that they need a way to track feature requests. They don’t. They need a product that will close deals, white papers, customer referrals, and a defined available market.
  26. Trying to land a 747 on a speedboat is never a good idea. Work in small batches, and plan at the last responsible moment.
  27. People say product managers need to learn to say “no”. Try “no, because ….” and endeavor to make some sense.
  28. Teams will always sniff out success theater. They might not call you out publicly, but they’ll become disengaged.
  29. When you are busy and multitasking it is easy to come off as standoffish.
  30. Don’t assume that people who complain in private, will also go to the mat in public.
  31. Before you go on about 10x engineers, ask yourself if you are a 10x product manager, and if you’re focusing on the 10% of things that will actually drive outcomes.
  32. Spend time in the support queue, jump on customer success calls, and try to close some deals.
  33. In most cases, your biggest competition is the status quo. Same goes internally.
  34. The users that have given up on you aren’t replying to your NPS survey.
  35. You are the CEO of the product if you can hire/fire, are responsible to investors, and control the budgeting process. If not, you are probably a product manager.
  36. Discuss what you’re ignoring, or making worse, in your quest to make something else better. Build shared understanding about the tradeoffs.
  37. Know when to get out of the way. If you’re good, you’ll always have work to do. Don’t insert yourself into every conversation and decision.
  38. Beware of complex prioritization schemes that serve (mostly) to make everyone internally more comfortable. Back-of-napkin heuristics are good enough in most cases.
  39. Nothing gets people more bitter than a PM who tries to self-promote. Celebrate (and fail and learn) with your team.
  40. Savor the moments when your team is kicking ass. It happens infrequently. Not because anyone is doing anything wrong, but because this is hard!
  41. If you find yourself asking for small estimates frequently — things that might take a day, or two, or three — make sure you’re actually working towards the most important outcome. If that’s the deciding factory, the value of story must be pretty darn weak.
  42. It’s not how many bullet points you add to the feature release notes (or story points completed or the team’s velocity). It’s the customer success stories you can tell, and the outcomes you can create for the business, both in the short and long term.
  43. You can fall in love with most product “problems”. Don’t rule out unsexy domains. Your happiness will be largely dictated by your immediate team, and the willingness of the organization to let you and the team solve problems. That can happen anywhere.
  44. When people keep bugging you about the roadmap, it’s typically a sign they aren’t happy with what’s happening right now.
  45. Block out time each day to think strategically. Block out time each day to interact with customers.
  46. If your team is moving slowly, make it safe for them to openly discuss the debt they’re digging out of and/or dealing with.
  47. Be available! This is a no brainer, but plenty of PMs keep their calendar stacked.
  48. Don’t force convergence prematurely. Often the best path forward comes after a period of confusion and messiness.
  49. If in doubt, get out of your head and gather data. Build something and test. Same goes with meetings where there is endless conjecture. Have a bias for action!
  50. Avoid calling a hard stop on an effort and surprising the team. It will seem arbitrary, and (hopefully) they are vested in the outcome.


# PM “Responsibilities” ?

There are a bunch of ways to unpack this question.

* * *

### PM “Responsibilities” ?

There are a bunch of ways to unpack this question.

In this post I look at the front-line team’s perspective, and share real world
results from a team exercise. In short, I don’t have the answer. You and your
team has the “answer”, and your context will change next week and you’ll need
to recalibrate. I explained this point of view recently in the Product HQ
Slack group when asked about the differentiation between PO/PM duties, but I
think it applies equally here:

> Get in a room. Make it safe for people to speak their mind. Make the
invisible work visible. Do a value stream mapping exercises. Make temporary
working agreements visible, but always subject to negotiation. And then find a
way to regularly inspect and adapt. In any rapidly changing context, roles and
responsibilities will be in constant flux. How you work will be in flux. If
they aren’t, you are probably over-optimizing on efficiency (unless you are in
a very, very stable domain).

> We often address the symptom … “if only we had clearer roles and
responsibilities”. And then a consultant comes in a writes a bunch of bullet
points. And the problems persist. Why? R/R wasn’t the problem. Having the
trust/safety to adapt and converse was the problem. Strict “contract
negotiations” on bullet points broke in a matter of days.

Here’s the messiness from the real world.

In this exercise, the team brainstormed areas of responsibility for the
product manager. As a team member, the product manager participated. Together
they removed perfect duplicates, but opted to keep items that overlapped but
had some unique characteristics (e.g. coaching and facilitation). I was blown
away by how many items they brainstormed in the ten minutes provided.

Independently, the engineers and product manager looked at each item and
indicated who was _responsible_ for the task/skill on a sliding scale. A score
“in the middle” meant that the responsibility was shared 50/50, whereas a
score on the left or right extreme meant that the PM/Engineers assumed full
responsibility for that item. Importantly the group was asked to take a broad
view of responsibility … “these are hats that we can all wear, and are not
written in stone”.

What do you notice? Where does this team need more shared understanding? Where
is there agreement and disagreement? How might you go about addressing those
deltas? Is some disagreement _healthy_?

# 90 Problems You’ve Heard About Before

Take heart. You are not alone.

* * *

### 90 Problems You’ve Heard About Before

#### Take heart. You are not alone.

In software product development, problems are a constant. Teams everywhere are
venting, ruminating, introspecting, experimenting, and searching. It isn’t
easy, and that is what makes it fun.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wa6E9Y_SJ_iM5eOyC16AsQ.jpeg)

Every fix has side effects, and superheroes all have a weakness. The obvious
invites the unexpected. Change is nonlinear, and rapid phase shifts can occur
unexpectedly. Human systems are messy. We’re biased, stubborn, and fall in
love with our ideas. A watched pot never boils and everything eats everything
for breakfast.

The problems will never stop coming. The trick then is how to deal with (and
to be strengthened by) the constant perturbations, threats, upheavals, and
change. How do you foster a self-repairing, self-strengthening system?

Because I’m sure (some of) these will sound familiar…

* * *

> Lots of the features we ship never get used

> I have no idea if anyone is using what we build and whether it is moving the
needle

> We can’t jump on opportunities fast enough. We miss the window altogether

> There’s a basic lack of confidence. We never make a single deadline or
commitment

> Stuff keeps breaking and feels brittle

> I’m not holding out hope for the reorg. We’ve done this before

> It takes forever to gain any kind of consensus about how to move forward

> Getting new environments up and running takes them forever. We’ve been
waiting for weeks

> We outsourced that. And now they are unresponsive

> I have no idea what is going on. There’s no visibility!

> It’s impossible to work with this codebase. The most basic thing takes
forever

> We need better user stories. There are too many unknowns. They are not ready
for development

> Our estimates are way off! It is embarrassing

> How do you put a number on a table-stakes feature?

> Teams are always stepping on each other’s toes. What can we do?

> How about the team’s ideas? I think we’ve got some decent ideas

> There’s so much rework. We can’t seem to nail it on the first or second
tries

> The shift from projects to continuous flow has been very challenging

> The developers are lazy. Don’t quote me on that, but it’s true. What can I
do? I’m a developer and I’m calling the kettle black

> No one is clear on the roles and responsibilities. Everyone is confused
about that

> What’s missing is leadership. Plain and simple. Sad to say, but I’ve lost
trust

> Everything is OK. Not great. Not bad. I just feel we could do _better
_somehow

> We have to be able to settle on a definition of done, and acceptance
criteria! Without those, we’re lost

> Not everyone can be as vocal. What about introverts? How do we get our ideas
heard?

> Competitors are running circles around us. How do they do it?

> The roadmap is too prescriptive

> How far ahead of the work should we get?

> Poor alignment. We’ll agree on something, and then all go out and do
something different

> I’m trying to advocate for the value of exploratory testing! It isn’t a
brainless task

> The difference between our A and B players is massive. The A players become
overworked

> It is hard to hire good people. More than hard, actually. Maybe it is a
regional thing

> They don’t appreciate UX as a discipline. It’s frustrating, because I think
we add something

> How am I supposed to keep moving forward in my career? I feel like I’ve
stopped learning

> We are missing the big picture and get stuck down in the weeds

> I appreciate the idea of co-locating. But that’s impossible in this
situation, and the remote team feels alienated

> We don’t know when to stop working on something. When is enough, enough?

> Until the VPs stop fighting, we’ll just be waiting around and watching

> Getting new people up to speed is painful and slow. Things seem so complex

> People arrive and the best people leave like 6 months later. They get sick
of it

> It depends on the team, but for some people the environment is kind of toxic

> Do we retrain or rehire?

> The word “debt” has been cheapened. All I hear about is debt this, and debt
that

> I’m not positive they do it on purpose, but I could swear they are ignoring
our team’s requests

> It has been crunch time for months now. People are burnt out

> The distinction between PO and PM has been a tough one for us to figure out

> Too many meetings with nothing to show for it

> Faster, faster, faster. We’re running fast and loose at the moment. Does
that make sense for the situation?

> Can you measure the agility of a team? How are we supposed to improve, if we
can’t measure our teams?

> The senior team members are so cocky. I’m always scared about making a fool
of myself

> We’ll meet, figure stuff out, but taking it back to the team requires a full
reset

> Story splitting makes sense, but sometimes it seems like we are just going
through the motions

a mess

> Are we doing Agile right?

> Can’t complain. I’ve got a sweet job. Team is fun to work with. I’d be
happier if I had more say in what stack we use, but I’m nitpicking now

> The teams just go rogue, even when they lack the experience. How do we tame
that?

> Work piles up in the backlog. It’ll take months/years before we are able to
work on some of those items

> Management just swoops and poops with no notice. So frustrating

> Design is not something you can do on demand. It takes take alone to get it
right

> Why don’t we catch these bugs before they hit customers?

> At what point do we split the backend and frontend teams?

> It’s a chore to get access to the right tools. Always a hassle

> Details matter. The vision thing is fine, but that isn’t what gets work done

> Engineers are not robots

nothing

### 20 Ways to Kill Elephants (In Rooms)

#### Or just dance with them…

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mct-FinIQlekRi-C29CQdQ.png)

<https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blind.JPG>

  * Attack the elephant head on during the budgeting process
  * Set a trap for the elephant. He’ll eventually overstep his bounds
  * Starve the elephant of attention and life-giving support and validation (to do this you must locate/control all sources of contributing energy, and have patience)
  * Introduce another elephant into the room, and let them fight for resources. Elephant jousting
  * Keep reminding people about the elephant with long emails. They’ll come around … eventually. Bonus: Reply All. Extra Bonus: Put the important bits at the end of the email
  * Persuade yourself that the elephant is much bigger than it appears and fight the good fight
  * Hire people to act as the elephant buffer. Build a human shield around the elephant and advocate externally for harmony and acceptance
  * Go to a conference, learn about complex adaptive systems, and tell everyone the story about [the blind men and the elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant) . That’ll blow everyone’s mind. We’re all the elephant dude…
  * Lure the elephant away from the room into another division
  * Talk incessantly about the elephant in 1:1s and repel with silent angst
  * Introduce a mouse into the room to antagonize the elephant
  * During retrospectives ask _why_ 5 times. Them: Elephant. Elephant. Elephant. Elephant. Elephant. You: We’re looking for root cause. Keep trying!
  * “Start with where you are” (elephant and all, Kanban Method style)
  * Build (or acquire) an innovation lab with barbed wire and 6ft thick walls. Sound proof it. Smuggle the work product out during cover of night, and hope that the elephant doesn’t take credit for it
  * Do nothing. Let the elephant leave/die when she is ready (or when company is disrupted and has to butcher the elephant for food)
  * Try to de-normalize the elephantine behavior with cultural manifestos and vague values that bear little resemblance to how people actually act
  * Try to transform the elephant into a more Agile / Teal / Lean elephant
  * Micro-services. Because, you know, micro-services. Micro-elephants with the AI power-up
  * Apply [methodology X] to organizational design. When it doesn’t work, listen to the consultants blame the elephant over drinks at the bar. If only…
  * Jump on the elephant! Become the invaluable elephant whisperer (aka “The Leadership Guru” or “). Write book, and become the darling of the exec set
  * Agree you need to rid yourself of the elephant (at an offsite, with trust activities and stickies), but get reminded a quarter later that the elephant pays the bills
  * Accept the elephant will outlive your stay. Retreat into craft and pragmatism until the time is right


# Play Your Own Game

### Play Your Own Game

We tend to obsess about hours per day/week worked.

> Look what that life-hacker gets done in thirty hours a week!

> Wow. They did that in their spare time in the evening working 10hrs weekly.

> He’s been pulling 60hr weeks for months now.

That’s the wrong metric.

Some people are sprinters. Some people are marathoners. Others are
steeplechasers, decathletes, and boxers. You can look over and say “wow, that
person is working a 12hr day, just like me”, but you don’t know what kind of
intensity they’re putting into their work.

If you burn super hot, you’ll destroy yourself doing a forty hour week. A
sustainable pace for you might be doing four hours of focused, distraction
free work. If you burn medium, you might be able to swing the 60 hour week and
still stay moderately productive. And then you have to figure in the impact
over the long haul. The sixty hour, medium-rare week might feel sustainable,
but only time will tell.

We’re told that if you “love your work” you’ll be “energized” by your work.
That might be true for some people, but it isn’t true for everyone. For some,
passionate work takes a great deal of energy and leaves you spent. Holding
yourself (and others) to that standard can be dangerous.

A big personal realization was that my “normal” is not “normal” (as in my
perception of normal). In eight hours I can dig myself a pretty big hole,
especially if I have time free for uninterrupted work. I work intensely. I run
the risk of overwhelming the people around me (and burning out). Trying to
keep up with coworkers leaves me at disadvantage.

But that’s just me. My friend Gloria describes her eight hour day as “pretty
chill”. She kills it, but without the same level of intensity. She’s more of a
marathoner.

So…look inwards and gauge your own energy. And accept that you’ll still have
distortions in how you sense time, output, and intensity. It’s “normal”.

### Talking Product: Running Themes from a Year of Conversations

I’ve talked to lots of product people (and engineers, UX, and agile coaches)
over the past year. I am commonly asked if certain themes bubble up again and
again. So I dug through my notes and recordings and looked for some running
themes, and then selected some exemplary quotes.

Some of these are verbatim (when I had the recording). Others were
reconstructed from copious notes.

#### Recruiting and churn is a big deal.

> We are having an incredibly hard time finding qualified PMs. It’s just so
hard to find that perfect fit. Our cross-functional teams are demanding
(especially the more senior developers and QA). The business is demanding. Our
customers are demanding. Attrition is high when we even fine them.  
> VP of Product

#### The plight of junior PMs, and the need for training

> Our track record when we place associate PMs directly on teams is abysmal. I
feel bad for them, and I feel bad for the teams. We’ve experimented with
training programs, but everyone is just so damn busy. They just don’t get it,
and I’m doing a terrible job helping them get it.  
> VP of Product

#### Need for product managers, the title, team assignments

> We’ve been questioning the need for PMs. I know we are _supposed _to have
one on each team. But do we really need one? How do they actually add value?
There’s a lot of confusion among our engineers and designers around the role
of the PM. I can see the need for a more senior PM for the whole product, but
it feels like we create “mini-products” just for kicks. It seems like another
role should exist, but I can’t describe it exactly.  
> Director of Engineering

#### Career development challenges

> Where do I go from here? I want to keep working with teams, but the only way
up is either to quit and join another company, or to move to another part of
the organization. Biz-dev maybe? Remember, there is one of us for between four
and six of “them” (engineers). Above me is a VP, and the reality is that we
only need a team that is _so big.  
> _Senior Product Manager

#### Tensions around using data in product development

> The engineering team talks about data all the time. We have two data
scientists at the whole company, and they are split across all of the
departments. They (the engineers) treat this like a science … like a big
machine learning experiment. I respect that, but we are simply not resourced
to do that. Even if we were, I don’t think it would be what they expect.
There’s serious tension at the moment around this topic. The product team
didn’t hire for these skills.  
> VP of Product

#### Filling the “gap” between the business and front-line teams

> About a decade ago we used to see the product manager as protecting the team
from the business. No one wanted to deal with the business, so we forced this
person to act as a go-between and to channel their needs. They were the
translation layer. It just isn’t like that anymore, honestly. And when it is —
when the team seems to be asking for that — we typically know something else
is going on.  
> Release Manager

#### Impact of velocity on product management

> Speed. Things are so blazing fast these days. We could release even more
often if we wanted to. This has put an immense amount of pressure on the
product management team. Maybe five years ago you could have argued “oh well,
this will take a while, we need to do more research”. Now there is a
definitive argument for just shipping and iterating. And killing the work if
we need to. I’m not sure that has stuck with everyone. You have this political
thing now with getting to iterate on something once shipped. On some level
that is a luxury!  
> Senior Product Manager

#### Engineer / product manager tensions

> The discussion is always about them and _their _product. Not _our _product.
Or it is about their ideas. You would think that they believe no one is
watching. We see what is happening with what we build. We look at the metrics.
We see the shifts in strategy when stuff goes wrong. They return from “high
profile” meetings with our “new direction”. Yes, this sounds bitter.  
> Engineer

#### Teams taking on product management responsibilities

> The interesting thing, is that as the individuals on the teams matured, we
started to see a changing role for product. The teams became more self-
sufficient. Without a PM/PO, we could hand them a problem — even a sort of
nebulous one — and they’d make progress. That changed the game for the PM, and
made it easier in some regards, but also harder. The game is more complicated.  
> Director of Engineering

#### Looking for an edge…

> I’d say things are good. We are always looking for that extra edge. The
discussions these days are more about metrics and how we measure our efforts.
Or how to really get UX working directly with engineers. That kind of stuff.
There is this sense that there must be something better out there that we are
not doing. The business is doing well, also, which hopefully is due in part to
our work. If there was a downturn things could get pretty dicey.  
> CEO

#### Growth and debt challenges

> It is easy to blame the product manager in this case. So convenient! But
taking a step back, our team is digging out from serious technical and
leadership debt. There’s only so much we can do at the moment. We grew and
grew, and now we are dealing with it. I’d say that half of the crap we’re
dealing with is self-inflicted because we are so nervous nothing is actually
getting done.  
> COO

#### Organization design and silos

> We’ve toyed with combining our product and engineer departments to form a
single product development group. I think we’ve got it under control at the
moment, but at a certain point the cultural differences between the
departments will come back to bite us. At the start, that’s how we worked. But
as we grew, the more loose “departments” became hardened. Throw UX into the
mix — now aligned with the product organization — and you have a lot of moving
parts.  
> CTO

#### Coaching and product owners

> My role is to help the teams, including the product owner. Repeatedly, I see
the product owner as the source of friction. At one point we had to do
retrospectives without the product owner present because the situation got
that bad. The blame rests on everyone’s shoulders, but I find myself spending
most of my time trying to help the product owners.  
> Agile Coach

#### Respect and trust

> Respect is so easily lost, and so hard to build up again. We have a strong
engineering culture, and to be blunt, we don’t suffer fools lightly. If the PM
seems manipulative, waffling, or unsure … the teams pounce.  
> Engineer


# The Learning Styles Myth and User Onboarding

When talking about the role of learning in onboarding, or in SaaS in general,
you’ll often hear comments like:

### The Learning Styles Myth and User Onboarding

When talking about the role of learning in onboarding, or in SaaS in general,
you’ll often hear comments like:

> You know, some people learn by just clicking around, some like to read the
manual, some just want to get their first task done, some are quick to call
technical support. People just have different learning styles.

It’s true that people differ in many ways when they arrive at a new feature or
product. But unpacking the idea of learning styles can dispel some myths about
instruction and give us some better insight.

The fields of educational psychology and instructional design can teach us a
lot about what makes for effective learning in onboarding. The notion that
people have a dominant learning style (visual, auditory, verbal, kinesthetic)
and learn best when instruction is tailored to that style is still widespread.

Surprisingly, though, this concept [doesn’t really hold up to
research](http://blog.cathy-moore.com/2015/06/how-to-respond-to-learning-
style-believers/). For one, although every person has strengths and weaknesses
and preferences, there isn’t any indication that those differences neatly fit
into a half-dozen or so defined styles. Second, studies are much more likely
to show that, regardless of personal preference, people learn best when
instruction methods are tailored to the type of content being taught.

So, if neat-and-tidy learning styles are largely a myth, what can we take from
instructional design research? We know that software users vary in their
goals, background, motivation, and preferences for how to learn, and that that
variation is far more complex than just learning styles. What affects users’
learning preferences?

  * Their goals and sense of urgency
  * Their willingness to try new things (one of the [“big five” personality traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits))
  * Cultural context and organizational culture context
  * Generational differences — people raised around computers and the web tend to have different approaches to information than those who weren’t
  * Incentives, potential rewards, potential costs
  * Different cognitive strengths and weaknesses
  * Technical savvy
  * Reading styles ([methodical versus scanning](http://www.slideshare.net/coolstuff/poynter-eyetracking-study-march-07/20-Scanning_readers_tend_to_Scan))

The list could go on and on! How can we approach learning for all of these
users? Looking at the instructional design literature, there are principles
and models that work and transcend learning styles. This is fertile ground
when considering your onboarding. One example is Gagne’s Nine Events for a
learner approaching and retaining any new information:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*R-k_a3w3TYQbDgtmZ2-qoQ.png)

<http://check-n-click.com/pin-up-resource-gagnes-nine-events/>

The situation of onboarding, however, often puts us farther from the moment of
learning than either a classroom teacher or an online course or tutorial
designer. Two concepts from education that can help us tackle this case are
self-directed learning and scaffolding.

#### Self-Directed Learning

Self-directed learning is a broad concept, but one clearly fits the situation
of an adult learner working in a digital environment with access to the vast
array of information on the web. In [self-directed
learning](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/suren-ramasubbu/is-learning-
increasingly-_b_7154164.html), learners “take the initiative, with or without
the help of others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning
goals, identifying human and material resources for learning, choosing and
implementing appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning
outcomes.” This fits with a user trying to get up to speed on a software
product. But, whether a student struggling to navigate the vast amounts of
information available digitally or a user trying to find what she needs in a
manual, overload is often the problem. Feeling overwhelmed by the number of
functions in an application often leads to users [skipping over available
documentation](http://digitalcommons.utep.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&context=cs_papers)
and this has led to the increasing minimal manual movement.

#### Scaffolding

How can we help self-directed learners swim a sea of information? [As this
article points out](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/suren-ramasubbu/is-learning-
increasingly-_b_7154164.html), this is a good niche for the educational
principle of scaffolding. The idea of scaffolding is that students learn by
being assisted as they attempt new tasks. As their proficiency grows, the
instructor gradually withdraws the support mechanism. In a traditional
classroom, the scaffold may consist of help from the teacher, or an exercise
that breaks a skill into simplified steps. But in an onboarding scenario,
there are different opportunities and options for scaffolding. In self-
directed learning, the “teacher” or resource can take many forms: content,
resource locator, motivator, and prompt for reflection and evaluation.

Of course, teaching is only part of what onboarding does. In addition to
improving learning in onboarding, we have to see the larger picture.
Onboarding itself can be assigned personas like coach, tour guide, concierge,
salesperson, librarian, and others. But when it seeks to teach, it’s best to
strive for excellent teaching suited to the content and the situation rather
than get bogged down in learning styles. Try to conceptualize how your
onboarding can help the self-directed learner get where they need to go.

### #NoEstimates. Two Different Problems

_If you’re not familiar with the #NoEstimates “debate”, try searching Twitter
for the #NoEstimates hash-tag. You have been forewarned._

It was probably silly to re-enter the fray, but I did…

> [](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/817462942186602497)

An explanation…

#### Risk Management

Risk management, compliance, and governance are extremely important. Spending
people’s money irresponsibly is fraudulent. When you’re paying for something,
it helps to have some sense of what you’re getting, when you’re getting it,
and how it will perform (even if you don’t have all the answers upfront). All
of this is _true_.

#### Underperforming Organizations

Many software development organizations (and the organizations they serve) are
not realizing their potential for value delivery. We’re not talking 8/10. No…
they performing at 1/5th or 1/10th of their capabilities (or more). They do
not deliver value continuously. Their practices are unsafe. And they fail to
learn and experiment. I’m not one for the 10x engineer thing. But I do believe
in (and have experienced, and measured) 10x organizations … and 1x
organizations.

* * *

So you have risk management on one side. Important. And you have poorly
performing organizations on the other side. Important.

Take a dysfunctional, under-performing organization and ask them what is
important and they’re likely to talk about “accountability, predictability,
hitting deadlines, and execution”. When you take a step back, what you often
see is that the org is battling a local maximum. Yes, those things are
symptoms of the problem, but the real problem runs deeper.

Chances are they’re battling a significant amount of organizational and
technical debt. There’s a lack of safety, humanity, passion, engagement, and
motivation. Sure, you can do a stellar job of risk management — and I truly
admire people who can do this well — but it belies the fact that you are eking
out a downhill 85mph run in an old Pinto, and there’s an 80% likelihood you’ll
make it from California to New York in 57.7hrs provided you pee quickly and
run the fuel tank to the red-zone.

The problem is that the _exact same practices_ — in _different contexts_ — can
constitute either 1) humane, reasonable conversations and a hearty effort to
help out the people involved, or 2) theatrics, hand-offs, command-and-
manipulate, and pass-the-buck. The _exact same practices. _One org’s
governance and compliance is a source of competitive advantage and employee
pride. Another org’s governance and compliance is their achilles heel, and
will lead to their disruption.

From my perspective, the #NoEstimates crew is focusing on the 80% of orgs that
have far bigger issues than estimates. They are trying to get a heartbeat
going … some flow, some focus, some breathing room, and some / any value
delivered. They are asking “how do you go from a 2x org to an 8x org?” and
stripping away the excess to answer that question. Trying to define _estimate_
is a rabbit hole in this particular conversation, and is almost beside the
point.

#NoEstimates detractors find this utterly irresponsible, as they are risk
management / project management pros and they live/breath this stuff. If I
needed a guidance system for my missile developed, I’d go to a #NoEstimates
detractor. If I was looking to turn around my company early in the game, I’d
go to a #NoEstimates advocate. Manage an outside contractor or assist my teams
with project work (vs. product work)… #NoEstimates detractor. We are talking
about two fundamentally different problems that happen to share the word
“estimates” _occasionally_.

The sad thing is that there are many skilled folks on both sides (of this
accidental, word inspired debate) that have a ton of great information to
share. And they do share! They contribute to the community in their respective
domains. But when I hear from people who are too _afraid _to join the
discussion for fear of being beaten down and harassed … then we have a
problem. It’s not productive and/or effective.

Sad really. I’d love to learn more about risk management, continuos value
delivery, and defeating the local maxima in under-performing orgs.


# Completed != Validated

Change your ticket statuses to beat the feature factory

* * *

### Completed != Validated

#### Change your ticket statuses to beat the feature factory

Words matter.

When we discuss “definition of done” we often forget the needs and goals of
our customers, users, and business (the true arbiters of done-ness). Closed
(or Completed in some companies) is a status value that effectively removes
the item from the team’s plate, records a completed-by date, and contributes
to the sprint’s story-point goal. Sure the story may be done and ready to
ship, but have we validated that the work is having the desired effect?
Accepted is no better. It is still not validated.

> But the story is part of a bigger epic! The story is done, even if the Epic
is not done. Actually, it can’t even really be shipped independently. Unless
we mark it done, and give it a narrow definition of done, it will muddy up our
dashboards!

If this is the case, you are missing the [I in
INVEST](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/invest/). The story cannot be
released _independently_ of other stories. It is not Valuable unto itself (the
V). Teams often run into this issue when they 1) are afraid to assign multiple
people to a single story, and 2) force the splitting of stories to obey the S
in Invest (Small), but do so at the expense of the integrity and user-focus of
their stories.

That still doesn’t really cut to the root of the problem. Our definitions of
done are not usually stated as desired outcomes. They are fancy specs.
Shipping is the goal, and the words we use (like Closed and Completed for
stories) only reinforce that. The desired outcome is lost somewhere in a PM’s
slides (or head).

To beat the [factory factory](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-
in-a-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2), you need to change your mindset. You have
to stop configuring your tools to reinforce the idea of a feature factory, and
adherence to Scrum “rules” that are often way too prescriptive. Yes, dev-
focused “tasks” are easier to grok than user-focused stories, but that’s what
ticket hierarchies are for. Most tools give you the power to rename your
status values.

How about Ready to Validate and Validated? Don’t let your tools and words mold
you. Need to show more logical nesting, and the validation cycle? Then show
it! Need longer sprints to actually deliver customer value. Lengthen them.
Think about the behavior you want — delivering validated customer value, not
feature bloat — and mold your tools and words around that.

So much process. So little indication of the work working …

# We Are What We Learn

When I talk to teams about data and evidence-driven product development, I
invariably encounter some fear and trepidation:

* * *

### We Are What We Learn

When I talk to teams about data and evidence-driven product development, I
invariably encounter some fear and trepidation:

“What if we measure the wrong thing?”

“What if the data shows no one is using that feature?”

“I’m not sure I really trust their analysis. It’s oversimplified!”

“We don’t have the budget for a data scientist!”

But knowledge is power, right? What are we so afraid of? Plenty. Data can
decide which initiatives are green-lighted or canned, which efforts have had
an impact, whether to increase or decrease headcounts, when to fire customers,
and when to pivot or proceed. This isn’t trivial stuff!

Sometimes fear holds us back from seeking data; other times efforts to use
data never bear fruit. Not for lack of trying — plenty of companies invest
massively in BI, analytics, data quality, eliminating data silos, etc. But
somehow, this yields no new insights and no changes in direction. Somehow all
prior assumptions and biases are confirmed, and it’s business as usual.

If there is one thing that the fear of data and failed attempts of data usage
have in common, it is the use of data for management, rather than for
learning.. These organizations miss the difference between instrumentation and
new insights. With KPIs, performance is _indicated_ and you’re checking
conformance to a predetermined plan. Measurement in this case is used _as a
management tool._

We’ve been told we are what we measure, and that we can’t manage what we can’t
measure. I’d flip that a bit to say that we are what we learn. And if we need
to learn something, we likely need to step out of the management-by-
measurement mentality. Whatever it is, we don’t know it yet! To learn it, we
need to be open to improvisation and experimentation. To quote H. Thomas
Johnson, “Perhaps what you measure is what you get. More likely, what you
measure is all you’ll get.”

Try asking yourself and your team these key questions:

  * What did we learn this month?
  * What must we learn more about next?
  * How should we try to learn about it?

These question are asked far too infrequently compared to questions like
“What’s the velocity,” “When will we finish,” “Is [person] performing,” and
“Are we on target to hit the revenue goal?” The end result is that teams end
up:

  * Not practicing, paralyzed by how to get started
  * Not exploring different methods and perspectives
  * Not addressing data quality issues for _new _areas of measurement
  * Not enjoying learning wins as a source of energy and buy-in

You have to make learning a regular part of your work. To make this happen, I
have found it helpful to convene a cross-functional learning team. Ideally
this team should meet regularly (weekly or biweekly) to keep the momentum
going. To make your learning team effective:

1\. Form a team drawing from different parts of your organization. This is
vital. By making this a team sport, you’re cross-pollinating learnings,
methods, question framing skills and more. In addition to generating new
learning, the goal is to leave everyone a bit more data-savvy and excited
about learning with data.

2\. Visualize a learning workflow (parallel to any ticketing systems or other
project roadmaps) and make a commitment to moving your questions through it.
Your best bet is to keep things conservative in terms of the amount of
learning work in-progress. Below is a sample work flow. Note how I’ve divided
in-progress questions into two potential workflows: one where the data is
available and must be gathered and cleaned before analysis, and the other
where some sort of experiment must be designed and run.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hxVhIjIir7aUKi-8TiB1Tg.png)

3\. Engage a data-savvy coach from inside your organization. Ideally you’ll
have someone with a strong data science background to act as a coach and
technical advisor. This analysis coach helps pair questions and learning goals
with the appropriate analysis technique and provides learning resources to get
people working through learning projects on their own. If the team or
individual hits an impasse, the coach should help out, but the goal is to
teach people how to fish.

4\. Share the learnings inside and outside the learning team. Learning is
contagious! Many teams forget what new insights feel like. They’re hyper-
acclimated to thinking about measurement for management (and we HIT this goal)
vs. measurement for learning. It’s also important to share your learnings on
gathering your learnings. Reflect on the techniques you used and challenges
you encountered (especially with access to data and data quality).

If your team feels anxious about data or your efforts at data-driven
development fall flat, think about how you’re using data. What are you
measuring and what are you learning? Learning is often overlooked, but crucial
for real insights.

### Trello, “Jira Sucks”, and Tool Dysfunction

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ozKxyhUOeYpIigJjGtN9pg.png)

I love [Trello](https://medium.com/u/fb5dd2d116a1) because there are very few
ways you can screw it up. You simply don’t use Trello for the “more
complicated” workflows because it fails miserably (thank god). It’s simple,
fast, no frills, and helps you focus on collaborating with other people and
getting work done. And that’s OK. I’m very happy that
[Atlassian](https://medium.com/u/5aa6b9976187) — a company I respect and
admire — [has purchased Trello.](https://hackernoon.com/what-the-trello-
acquisition-means-for-atlassian-6a21ef7ac169#.mem6innxb)

> But John, Jira sucks! Maybe the Trello pixie dust will rub off on Jira…

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MhmjV3gNgZe383L0IUAUVA.png)

I think that is a vast oversimplification, and shows very little sympathy to
the challenges faced by Atlassian (and the advantages the Trello team
enjoyed). The problem isn’t Jira.

The problem is that we inevitably come to hate every issue tracking product we
use. We hate them because we (the users) overload/customize them with the best
of intentions, and then our needs change. And finally because businesses see
these tools as some sort of necessary evil: a management tool instead of a
catalyst to drive better customer outcomes and inspire continuous improvement.
If front-line teams could link their use of said tools to better individual
and customer outcomes, they’d like them.

Great case in point. My friend proclaimed “I hate Trello!” Turns out he
started working at a company that had butchered it beyond recognition to
“manage” an incredibly bloated process. It only takes one bout of food
poisoning. And…we tend to graft team dysfunction on the tools we use. If we’re
always frustrated when using Jira, we’ll associate it with Jira! A tangled
process implemented in Jira remains tangled.

#### Discouraging Continuous Improvement

Tools tend to force premature convergence on a process, and then make it
ridiculously inconvenient to change that process. The tool is running the
team, and not the other way around. Teams should be encouraged to continuously
improve on the way they work. Are two week sprints too long, or too short? Can
we clarify our working agreements? Is the team driving a new value stream? Do
we need to shift things around to address a bottleneck? Should we flag items
for pairing? Mob? Add a new layer to the ticket hierarchy? Teams should be
able to adapt accordingly.

#### Customized Into Oblivion

To complicate the issue, the more you try to customize tools to make everyone
happy (and to make the job they have right now easier), the more bloated and
inflexible the user experience becomes. That magic executive-level dashboard
is now a reality, but at the expense of letting teams reflect and adapt on how
they work (and likely burdening them with non-customer facing administrative
work, aka the dreaded “update your tickets, everyone!”).

What you see in many cases is that the business is still in a waterfall
mindset, and that a good bit of our tool customization is centered around that
translation layer.

#### Benefits

You’ve gotta ask … how is the team _actually benefiting_ from using the
product? Is the tool helping them deliver _more value to their customers_?
When I ask this, I’ll **often hear** about benefits like tracking,
accountability, visibility, estimation, managing dependencies, status checks,
notifications, executive roll-ups, and reporting. I **hear very little** about
improved collaboration, better insights, improved quality, more effective
retrospectives, and increased team motivation / sense of ownership / clarity
of mission. I **almost never hear** about improved end-customer outcomes.

Ask an engineer or UXD “what tools help you build better more usable software”
and they’ll have an answer. It won’t be the ticketing/workflow product.

#### Hmmmm

Anyway. That is what’s on my mind today. Are the tools running the team, and
not the other way around? Is your tooling delivering better outcomes to your
customers, or just making everyone feel better internally? Do all of those
layers of customization really add value?

Also, do we always fail when trying to to mix workflow, continuous improvement
efforts, and collaboration on tickets in a single tool? I always advise teams
to work with a physical board to reflect on and tweak how they work. And THEN
pick a tool. Instead, teams figure they’ll “do Agile”, figure everyone does
Scrum to the book, and buy a tool to enforce said process. It rarely ends
well.

### Product vs. Single Projects (and 8x Teams)

[A couple posts ago](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/noestimates-two-
different-problems-b4f37d29ce5d#.35gaa53lr), I mentioned something about teams
improving their capacity for value delivery “by 8x”. Someone I respect
questioned that claim, which in turn lead to an interesting conversation.

#### Single Project

Take a narrowly defined project in isolation. Assume the customer can describe
exactly what they need (by the way, I think this is actually _possible_ in
some domains, others would disagree). Prescribe a tech stack. Measure the
outcome based on how much the project _costs_, when it is _completed_, and
conformance to some sort of spec. Run the test over and over on different, but
similarly skilled teams. In this case, and against these metrics, I don’t
think you’ll ever see one team outperform another team by 800%.

Maybe a crude example … ask 50 similarly sized expert home building teams to
build a single house to plan, and you wont see one team build it in 2w and one
team build it in 16w.

#### SaaS Product

Take another scenario. A company wants to make as much revenue as possible
while at the same time retaining their existing customers. The company
delivers their software via web browsers to 20,000 customers, and earns the
bulk of its revenue from monthly subscription fees. In this case, I think it
is entirely possible for the best teams to produce 8x the revenue (or more).
Why? The best/better teams would likely…

  * Pick/choose what to continue building based on outcomes and validation. The best teams would double-down on fewer initiatives
  * Get multiple shots at solving certain problems. The customer doesn’t receive the end-product one day and walk away
  * Evolve tight feedback loops (days, instead of months/quarters)
  * Hire new team members based on feedback loops. Hiring alone in a complex, evolving product domain can be a huge differentiator
  * Evolve their tech stack to meet new challenges (it becomes part of the product). This is where devops comes in. Keep debt low
  * Leverage economies of scale across their large customer base
  * Avoid custom solutions for specific customers (not necessary)
  * Might choose to offer a platform offering and create a developer ecosystem
  * Etc.

Again, probably a bad example … but imagine a construction company toying with
prefab, new materials, variable floor plans, 1000s of homes, etc. I could see
one generating 8x the revenue.

In short, they can beat the [feature/project
factory](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-
44a5b938d6a2#.ns8x01yum) approach, which opens up all sorts of opportunities
for optimizing value delivery. I repeatedly see large enterprise software
product companies with vast resources get shellacked by small, nimble teams.
Or even on a very local level the relative performances of UX Research or
Growth teams.

This is the 8x I’m talking about. The distance between the best and the
mediocre is great.

The differences here make comparisons difficult. You’ll hear someone talking
about product development practices, and it will sounds completely foreign. Or
someone talking about competitive contract work, and their challenges will
seem foreign as well. Context is everything!

### The 20 Jobs Of In-App Messaging

Great in-app messaging is an extension of your product’s UX, and of your
organization as a whole. Those pixels, prompts, and flows have a style and a
voice, and show up to work every day (24hrs a day, without fail, without
coffee) to get the job done.

Nailing down that job is critical. It’s easy to jump straight to drawings and
mockups, or try to accomplish too many things at once. The goal of this post
is to get you out of the weeds (and your app) and trigger the creative juices.
We ask: “If the in-app messaging was a person, what would that person’s job
(or jobs) be?” In this post, we present twenty(!) possible personas for in-app
messaging.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ztdvmPFk0F6yJMiDbXu0vg.png)

Who does your product (and your users) need to hire?

#### Coach

The coach is all about your big goals and the plan for how to get there. It’s
the coach’s job to take that path to glory and break it down into achievable
steps. Along the way, she keeps track of progress and keeps you accountable —
if you’re not showing up to workouts, she’ll let you know you’re off-track.
The coach is also a motivator who reminds you to celebrate the intermediate
steps on the way to your goal, who checks in on your well-being and cares,
even if she has to take you to task now and again.

#### Teacher

The teacher wants to help you master a particular skill. That means getting
your attention, building your understanding of the basic concepts, showing you
how to apply your learning in the real world, and keeping it all lively and
engaging. A good teacher knows the subject matter and finds it interesting
himself. Teaching can be very focused and brief (_show me how to do this!_) or
broad and mind-expanding (_teach me about this field!_).

#### Usher

The usher keeps everyone moving along toward a particular goal, knows the
layout of the product top to bottom, and understands how traffic needs to
flow. The usher welcomes you, makes sure you have your ticket, and points you
to where you need to go. The interaction is friendly, helpful, and brief — the
show must go on!

#### Tour guide

The tour guide learns your interests and uses that information to plan a good
tour. She has deep knowledge of the points of interest along the route and
what areas will be valuable to you. More than a teacher or a product
demonstrator, the tour guide wants to keep you engaged by telling a great
story. You find yourself in suspense, listening intently to find out the
mystery behind that spooky landmark over there. You’re learning a lot, but
you’re enjoying the ride.

#### Maître d’

The maître d’ is there to oversee your total experience. Waiters and others
may handle the details, but the maître d’ just wants to make sure you’re
happy. He checks in. Are you having a good time? Are things going smoothly?
How is the atmosphere? Is the music too loud? The maître d’ is proactive, but
takes a big-picture perspective.

#### Analyst

The analyst is your eye on the data. An expert to provide insights on the
important trends and a forecaster to help you understand where things are
going. An savvy adviser who connects disparate threads that you might not have
seen and offers _Did you know…?_ insights. She helps you make sense of the
information and see your path forward.

#### Lawyer

When you need one, you need one. Someone has to take care of the legal details
and help you understand what you need to know in all of that fine print. The
lawyer presents you with terms and conditions, makes you feel comfortable
accepting them, and explains the privacy policy.

#### Demonstrator

You’ve seen this persona on late-night TV. A good product demonstrator puts on
a good show. He’s charismatic, energetic, and skilled at drawing people in.
You learn by watching the product in action. You know it’s a bit of a sales
pitch, but somehow you can’t turn away as the demonstrator walks you through
all the features and possibilities of the product. _Yes, it’s just that easy!_

#### Greeter

The greeter isn’t going to follow you around for long, but wants to make sure
you have a good first impression. The greeter makes you feel welcome and
quickly assesses your needs and disposition. Based on that, she quickly frames
what’s possible (Yes, we have what you’re looking for!) and points you in the
right direction.

#### Cashier

In a self-service model, you might not need much assistance once you’re ready
to make the purchase, but you need someone to help you with those last few
details. You might need to clarify a couple of questions about pricing or how
things work, and you count on the cashier to help with those. But, mostly,
you’re ready to buy and the cashier creates a clear and friendly path through
the transaction.

#### Lifeguard

The lifeguard is always on the lookout to make sure you’re safe and keep you
out of trouble. She proactively creates a safe environment through signage and
warnings, and, if something bad happens, can swoop in with speed and agility
to help out. You can relax and do your thing knowing that someone is there if
danger arises.

#### Customer service representative

While the lifeguard may prevent catastrophe, sometimes you need help with a
particular problem. The service representative is your problem troubleshooter.
He is there to calm you down and works to quickly understand the nature of
your problem. Unlike a teacher, who might build your skills by helping you
find your own solution, the service representative presents a highly
prescriptive solution as soon as possible. You need help now, and the service
person is there to get you on your way.

#### Cheering squad

You’ve got a lot of work to do and someone needs to keep your morale up! The
cheering squad celebrates your victories and encourages you to keep at it when
the going gets tough. They cue up the band and bring the positivity when you
need to avoid getting discouraged.

#### Researcher

The researcher is a mediator between the customer and the company and is all
about asking questions and gathering insights. She has her own agenda composed
of learning goals and seeks out people of interest to get the necessary
information. She wants to establish a friendly dialogue, but to do good
information-gathering, she needs to remain unbiased and not try to sway your
responses.

#### Personal assistant

The personal assistant helps you out by staying one step ahead of the details.
He’s an expeditor in complex situations, making arrangements and smoothing out
wrinkles. The personal assistant takes care of the busy work and knows what
needs to happen to help you get something done. You feel like you can relax a
bit more when your personal assistant is on the job.

#### Bulletin board

The bulletin board is an information hub for the community. It’s where you go
to keep up with news, updates, and items of interest. Having this go-to helps
to build general awareness and knowledge, assuming that you are eager to stay
in the loop.

#### Emergency Broadcast Announcer

_Beeeeeep….beeeeeep….chhhhrrrrrrrr. _When it’s not just a test, the emergency
broadcast announcer gets the word out that something is happening. The stakes
are high and people need to know. They get right to the point and explain the
impact of a situation concisely.

#### Closer

_What do I need to do to get you into this car today? _The closer is there to
seal the deal and make the sale. The closer is persuasive and focused on
finalizing things in a timely fashion. The value of the closer to the business
is obvious, but the closer’s value to the customer is all about timing. If
it’s too soon, you hate the closer. If you’re tired of mulling it over and
want to make this decision and move forward, the closer can be just what you
need.

#### Traffic signaler

Maybe your teacher taught you how to drive and your usher gave you directions,
but you’re running into a snarl. The destination is the same, but the way to
get there has changed. There is a new traffic pattern, or construction that
has complicated your usual route. You need someone with clear signals (and
perhaps a sign or two) to slow you down and help you navigate.

#### Reference librarian

The reference librarian is all about keeping track of information. She has all
the available resources on the tip of her tongue and can help you understand
what information is available and where to find it. More importantly, she
knows that there are multiple ways to find and categorize each item, can find
a route to the information you need from more than one starting point, and can
help you see how resources are related.


# Unvalidated Complexity is a Liability

### Unvalidated Complexity is a Liability

David Frahm asked me to explain this Tweet:

> [](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/830500858651570176)

> [](https://twitter.com/davidfrahm/status/830537461415673856)

So what is the liability?

Complexity can kill the future ability of a team to seize opportunities and
change course. Any developer who has worked on a bloated codebase can attest
to this. Any support engineer who has had to support a bloated set of features
understands this. Any marketer who has had to market to dozens of personas
understands this. I’m not suggesting being risk adverse. But leaving
features/interface/integration points in your product “just because” is a
recipe for eventual collapse of the system.

The problem is that complexity is often invisible, and its impacts are non-
linear. I wish folks would do the “remove a feature for every feature you add”
approach more seriously.

Let’s take a rapidly growing startup. A broad product appealing to many
personas will be easier to sell. Being able to say “yes, we do that” works
great on phone calls. You’ll grow quickly. But what you are essentially doing
is passing the buck to your future self. At some point you’ll need to increase
your team size exponentially, development will slow to a crawl, marketing will
drown trying to appeal to everyone, and the whole house of cards will come
tumbling down.

The answer isn’t fear or being risk adverse. Or going slowly. But the cult of
velocity seems to only address speed of output, and not speed of
validation/learning. We tend to ignore velocity of learning. I think the
reason so many UXers and Devs have come to despise the idea of MVPs is that
they work in environments where they are asked to cut corners (introduce
complexity), and then never get a chance to act on that learning. MVP = crappy
guess and deal with it. The cycle time for learning is infinity.

### Usability Principles and Onboarding

With onboarding, the focus is often on the particular and more particular. Who
is your user? What are her goals? What is going on at this very moment in his
interaction with the app? In this post, though, we’ll take a step back to
bring overarching principles of usability to the discussion.

Usability heuristics are widely recognized principles that guide (or should
guide) all software and user interface design. Heuristic evaluation provides a
way to examine how well a process meets these overall goals for user
experience and pinpoint possible trouble spots.

Two well-known sets of usability heuristics were developed by Jakob Nielsen
and Bruce Tognazzini, respectively. Nielsen’s heuristics (which can be[ found
here](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)) were
released in their current form in 1994 and are some of the most used for user
interface design. Tognazzini, who designed Apple’s first human interface and
wrote _First Principles of Interaction Design_ developed another set of
heuristics (which can be[ found here](http://asktog.com/atc/principles-of-
interaction-design/)). There is overlap between these two, and here we’ll
review how some principles found in both can be applied to onboarding:

**_“Bring to the user all the information and tools needed for each step of the process.” -Tognazzini_**

**_“Visibility of system status” -Nielsen_**

The user should have a clear understanding of what is going on at all times.
Status information should be visible, accurate, and continuous, keeping the
user oriented. This chain of information should remain clear during
onboarding.

Keeping the user aware of status helps create a positive onboarding
experience. Poorly designed onboarding where the user doesn’t know what is
going on can be overwhelming and confusing. Status feedback should answer
questions like: Where am I in the overall process? Am I creating real data,
and will my entries be saved? Is this working? Is it loading?

**_“The most important consistency is consistency with user expectations.*” -Tognazzini_**

**_“Match between system and the real world” -Nielsen_**

Usability is defined by meeting users where they are. Systems should strive to
work with existing user behaviors and knowledge when possible. The verbal and
visual language of an app should match the language and conceptual
understanding of the user, not the developers.

If users are accustomed to working a certain way in your app, then it’s best
for your onboarding to conform to that pattern, whether it’s “right” or not.
When adding an onboarding experience to an existing application, it’s easy to
introduce inconsistency. In addition to being frustrated by unfamiliar
functionality, users will distrust overlays, tooltips, and walk-throughs that
don’t match the visual styling of the rest of the product. Pay close attention
to content, styling, placement of buttons, rules for advancing and exiting,
etc., and strive for consistency and familiarity.

**_“Use Active Discovery to guide people to more advanced features.” -Tognazzini_**

**_“Recognition rather than recall” -Nielsen_**

Active discovery means that, instead of waiting for users to discover an
interface item, we directly offer it to them. This kind of process is the core
concept of onboarding. However, it works best in balance with Nielsen’s
concept of user education, in which it’s important to minimize memory demands
for the user.

For active discovery to work, you need to anticipate when the user will need
something. An onboarding experience that introduces advanced features that the
user won’t need for a week contributes to cognitive overload and is unlikely
to be useful. You also need to figure out how to remind users of features
without overloading them with reminders.

**_“Give users well-marked roads and landmarks, then let them shift into four-wheel drive.” and “Sometimes you have to provide deep ruts.”-Tognazzini_**

**_“Flexibility and efficiency of use” -Nielsen_**

These principles speak to the balance between direction and user freedom. We
want advanced users to be able to move more quickly, while still giving enough
guidance to inexperienced users. With onboarding, it’s easy to think in terms
of a very linear progression, but making that too strict is at odds with user
freedom. When and where should we give the user the opportunity to “shift into
four-wheel drive” and advance past steps? If we’re providing deep ruts, is
there a benefit that justifies the structure and is clear to the user?

The concept of landmarks is also relevant for onboarding. Multi-step
onboarding experiences can feel unsettling when when other parts of the
interface are obscured. Convey a sense of place by using familiar landmarks.
The next step in an onboarding sequence should also be visible. Difficulty
finding the next step drains users’ reserve of attention.

**_“Make actions reversible.” -Tognazzini_**

**_“User control and freedom” -Nielsen_**

In Nielsen’s words, “Users often choose system functions by mistake and will
need a clearly marked ‘emergency exit’ to leave the unwanted state without
having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.”

In onboarding experiences, always keep the user’s exit option in mind. Guiding
someone through a long series of steps without a clear sense of being able to
“back out” will leave your users very anxious. It’s calming to hear “you can
review your order at any time” or “feel free to go back and check things
over.”

Avoid form workflows where there is no legitimate ability to go back and undo
past steps. And, when you ask a user to experiment with a new interface,
assuage their fear that they will mess things up. When the user is
experimenting, make it clear that “this is just a test project” or that “you
can’t mess up.”

**_“Make it easy and attractive to stay in.” -Tognazzini_**

**_“Consistency and standards” and “Visibility of system status” -Nielsen_**

This principle emphasizes that people are more likely to stick with a task
when they know where they are and how to move around as needed, and ties in
with the general themes of consistency and keeping the user oriented. If you
reduce stress and cognitive load for the users, it’s easier for them to engage
with your app longer.

One common application of this principle is that you should not force users to
rely on their browser’s back button to go backwards. Test this out in your
onboarding progression. Can users reliably move backwards and forwards without
using the browser button? If they do use the browser button, what will happen?

**_“Use Progressive Revelation to flatten the learning curve.” -Tognazzini_**

**_“Recognition rather than recall” -Nielsen_**

Progressive revelation is a technique that spreads information and actions
over several screens in order to avoid overwhelming the user. Information
typically moves from broad and abstract to more specific, or interactions move
from simple to complex. In this way, the user has a chance to gradually become
familiar with complex sites or applications. This is in keeping with the idea
that information should be provided in ways that reduce the user’s memory load
— small pieces of information, close to where they’re needed.

Progressive revelation, or progressive disclosure, is central to onboarding.
But you should always be balancing the number of options and the amount of
information. Too many options or too much information create cognitive
overload. Too little limits the user’s sense of control. Think about the ways
that your onboarding can pace information to facilitate learning.

Important to remember is that checking your onboarding (or any process)
against these usability heuristics is _not a substitute for usability
testing_. The heuristics serve to make sure you’re on the right track and may
provide some bursts of insight, but for each case, you need to make sure that
the details of what you’re doing for your target persona in this exact
situation are working effectively.

*This heuristic, presented by Tognazzini, is a quote from William Buxton.

### 10 Big Software PM Time Wasters

Time management is extremely important for PMs. You want to focus your energy
on the activities that will have the highest leverage for your customers and
team. Over my career (as a software product manager)I’ve wasted a ton of time
doing things that felt high-leverage at the time, but didn’t produce lasting
value. Below I’ve listed the top ten culprits …

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KnQtBXoI1-CgVmtOSyPMlQ.png)

**1 . Setting up elaborate systems to collect, track and reply to customer feature requests**. I very rarely see this produce value for either customers or teams. I’m not talking specific feedback and research, where you cast a focused net for something you are currently working on. And I’m not talking about lightweight feedback channels that you can query for background info, and even use to recruit customers for research. Rather, I’m talking about the pipe-dream that you’ll somehow open up the forum for feature requests, allow voting, and that this will somehow be helpful in roadmap prioritization. In the end, you just waste everyone’s time (including, most importantly, your customers). The volume of feedback just overwhelms the team’s ability to organize and act on the information.

**2\. Story Point Estimation**. I firmly believe in [cost of delay estimates](http://blackswanfarming.com/cost-of-delay/). And, I also believe that economic decisions require some sense of the investment necessary for a particular effort. The standard argument behind story point estimation is that it “triggers the right conversations” or “helps us not overcommit” or “helps us stock our sprint.” I think those end-goals (those conversations) are possible without the mind-numbing ritual. There are “good” reasons to estimate, and then a whole host of dysfunctional reasons. Spend more time on the value/outcome side and less time worrying about the difference between one and three day stories and t-shirt sizes.

**3\. Roadmap fire-drill**. I’m all for strategic thinking. I’m all for gathering data and describing some potential points on the horizon. Evolving your strategy should be a continuous activity. Unfortunately, that’s not how it works. Oh no … sales is feeling nervous about the current product and want a “roadmap” (translation, a list of things you will build that they will sell without promising, of course). Oh no … the CEO/founder is about to talk to the board and needs a “roadmap” (translation, all the sexy things that will attract their attention). Oh no … the CTO needs to staff up and make a yearly plan, so they want to know what you have in mind (e.g. need you to have a crystal ball). Here’s a better way. Always maintain a rolling 6 months, 12 months, and 2-year roadmap … not the features you’ll build, but the outcomes you’ll focus on. Don’t play defense. Play offense. Get people what they really need instead of outsourcing product strategy to the rest of the company.

**4\. Figuring out how to parallelize work and maximize work-in-progress**. PMs spend an inordinate amount of time figuring out ways to eek out every minute of developer coding time. “If we reduce the scope of this story, can you take on this other story as well?” “While we wait for feedback on that story, can you start these other three stories?” You’re wasting your time. You are getting too far into the weeds, and if getting that far into the weeds is going to determine your product’s success, you’ve got other things to worry about. So what if someone spends an afternoon refactoring or working down some debt? Is that the end of the world? What you’ll eventually learn is that the more you micro-manage their work, the more the team will optimize around retaining their sanity while being micro-managed. They will create their slack whether you like it or not. Stop playing Tetris with your team.

**5\. Horse-trading and auctioning the team’s resources**. “And 50% of our team will go to you, and 20% to you, and 15% each to these two other projects.” If you are finding yourself saying these things (or thinking these things), you’ll be fighting a big uphill battle for your product. It isn’t a product anymore! You are a project-shop. As a PM, imagine the world where the context and case you build would nullify all of this guessing. You’d make a case that would shut up all the guessing and requests, and people would say “damn, we’re excited for that … keep doing what you’re doing!” AND, you’d engage your team in that journey. I don’t think there is anything inherently wrong with a project-shop if you just call it out as such and call yourself a project manager.

**6\. Gathering information not applicable to your current initiative**. This is similar to #1, but it should be called out. PMs participate in countless meetings that generate information that is simply not actionable in the near-term. We’re told to be “responsive” and to “connect” with different parts of our organization, but again we’re wasting our time and the time of our internal stakeholders. Evangelism and maintaining relationships is important. So the key is to keep it pertinent and guide the conversation to the here-and-now.

**7\. Communicating to customers through proxie**s. Whenever possible, you need to go to the source. It’s not that other people (e.g. sales, marketing, customer support) are wrong or don’t provide useful information. Rather you’ll never get to ask the important questions, and you will waste other people’s time trying to get that information. Better yet your team should be there with you on the call. Never hesitate to get on the phone and talk to a customer.

**8\. Figuring it out in a small group**. God forbid the whole team attended a meeting and worked something out! No, instead we arrange “small meetings” to work things out. And then we decide on something, take it to the team, and only then realize that no one is on the same page. Sure, we may meet with a senior dev. And that might be “more efficient” and “less disruptive.” But how will your team ever get better at collaboration when things are a little messy? Again, we work too hard to keep things efficient and spend too little time investing in the resilience and overall performance of the team. Although I don’t think we do this consciously, I believe we try to keep ourselves relevant. These “important” small meetings achieve that.

**9\. Communicating status when the status hasn’t changed**. This behavior is often beyond our control, but as PMs, we spent lots of time telling people how/why things are on track even when nothing has fundamentally changed. Worse yet, we spend far more time communicating status than actually communicating results and outcomes. If all you do is communicate status, then that is all people will expect out of you.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5Shd9Ebth2j-eQO_kIR0ww.png)

**10\. Guessing and premature convergence**. Everyone is freaking out that they don’t have all the answers. You’re on the spot. What do you do … make shit up (consciously or unconsciously). We spend lots of time as PMs persuading people we have things figured out even when we don’t. That’s partially because they are risk averse. And that is partially because we create a conveyor belt of features and need to keep things rolling off the line. Instead of saying “hey, let’s get something in front of customers, and we can kill it if it doesn’t work” we say something like “ok, it looks like we all agree on the direction here, let’s ship it.” Consider how much time you invest keeping up the illusion that you know everything.

### Do You Ask For Story-Level Estimates?

Given the situation below, do you ask the team to estimate individual stories?
If so, why might you need story-level estimates? How would these story-level
estimates benefit you? If not, why are you comfortable not having story-level
estimates?

This is not a trick question. It could go either way. I’d love your feedback
in the comments.

  * Latest [NPS survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter) shows a high concentration of “detractors” complaining about the lack of a particular capability. It is costing customers hours of manual work per month, and they are pissed. There are a range of solutions that may fulfill the need, but no clear winner
  * Detailed [customer exit interviews](https://www.groovehq.com/blog/exit-surveys) reveal that a growing percentage of customers choosing not to renew their annual contracts are doing so because of the lack of this capability
  * Existing customer interviews indicate that even longtime customers (who were once “promoters”) are considering leaving for a competitor if this issue is not addressed. Historical data on NPS surveys for this product show that a certain % of detractors will consistently churn
  * Sales is losing deals because this capability is missing, as evidenced by demo call transcripts and [“closed-lost” interviews](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-follow-up-with-closed-lost-opportunities)
  * The team believes ~$4,200,000 in existing recurring annual revenue is at risk (around 350 out of 10,000 customers), as well $69,230 per week in lost new ARR for new deals
  * The 350 customers are expected to leave over the next 6 months, so for _every week of delay _we estimate it will cost the company — between existing churned customers and lost new deals — $230,768 per week in lost revenue
  * The product development team (one of 20 such teams at the company) consists of 4 engineers, 1 UX, 1 PM, and 1 QA, and costs ~$20,000 every week
  * Team is able to ship code at will (multiple times weekly, if required)
  * Team has been stable for &gt;6 months and has experience delivering value to the persona in question (and ownership/familiarity with this area of the code). The team is savvy when it comes to decomposing stories, experimenting, validating assumptions,pivoting when required, and delivering
  * Supporting this type of feature also involves 1) training the support team $30,000, 2) updating marketing collateral $15,000, 3) training the sales team $30,000, 4) free customer training sessions $10,000, and 5) a couple of expensive C-level meetings $10,000. $95,000 in total
  * No extra infrastructure is required to support the feature
  * We ask a senior interaction designer, UX researcher, and lead engineer to take stock of the whole effort. Together, these three team members have a combined 50 years of experience with similar domains. They have a chat for fifteen minutes. The ID and researcher see some UX complexity and suggests the team might want to try a couple versions of the flow with real customers and a working version. The lead engineer doesn’t expect any surprises unless they hit a known limitation in the current API . Both agree that they would be surprised if it took &gt;5 months to successful iterate towards a viable solution (less than 10% chance). There are some potential solutions that could take as little as 3–4w. So somewhere between 4w and 5 months
  * The product development team participates in a “workshop” including 1) a [story-mapping exercise](http://jpattonassociates.com/story-mapping-quick-ref/), 2) interviewing visting customers and a review of the qualitative and quantitative data 3) a [design studio activity](https://zapier.com/blog/run-a-design-studio/) exploring different UX options, and 3) a review of the existing API to assess potential risks. This yields a couple possible directions, but again there is no clear winner


# Outcomes? We’re Programmed to Get into the Weeds

In response to my post on feature factories, a friend asked…

### Outcomes? We’re Programmed to Get into the Weeds

In response to my post on [feature factories](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-
youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2#.4mfv4tryz), a friend asked…

> How do I keep the team focused on outcomes?

Me: I’m guessing you do some kind of kick-off. At a certain point the
conversation shifts away from outcomes. Teams transition from talking about
outcomes to talking about tasks, phases, deliverables, and solutions. Our day-
to-day work centers around execution. What did you do yesterday? What is on
your plate today? Are we blocked? Are we on track? When can we ship? When can
we start on the next project?

None of this is inherently bad. This is what humans do … we break things down
into mini-projects and check things off of our list. After thinking briefly
about the _why _and _who, _we jump quickly to the _how _and _what. _The
problem is that we’re only exercising one muscle, and we stop asking
questions. We get stuck in the weeds. The team can outsource this thinking to
a PM or business stakeholder, but this weakens the muscle further.

Shipping feels good. Merging a PR feels good. Knowing what your next couple
weeks will look like feels good. Getting the deliverable to a downstream team
member feels good. And because this stuff feels good, it tends to be what we
optimize around. This holds true in especially tense and political
environments as well. Being able to say “we delivered on what you asked for”
will never get you into trouble, and it might be all that you can control.

In my experience, seeing that your work actually had impact rules the day and
feels VERY good. But in lieu of that, people want to feel (pretty) good. They
certainly don’t want to feel threatened, judged, or set up to fail.

Staying focused on outcomes is incredibly difficult, and often uncomfortable.
So is _experimentation_. Though it is popular to talk about experiments, I
rarely hear people tell me about _failed _experiment. Heck, in many
organizations simply getting _anything _done — let alone anything done quickly
enough to iterate and/or reflect on outcomes — is very challenging.

My point is that 1) we spend most of our time in the weeds, 2) it is
comfortable (and maybe even safer) in the weeds, 3) you need to get into the
weeds to get stuff done, 4) we structure our orgs (and work) around most
people being in the weeds, most of the time, and 5) the slower we move, the
more time we end up in the weeds. This is what you’re up against when trying
to take an outcome-focused approach. I’ve fallen into the trap of
underestimating just how deep these currents run.

You have to make a big concerted effort!

  * Make it safe to move quickly, receive feedback quickly, and change course quickly
  * Make it safe to set goals and miss the mark
  * Celebrate outcomes (not simply shipping), and celebrate learning
  * Align teams around missions/outcomes, not ship dates
  * Express your roadmap in terms of missions/outcomes (not features)
  * Spend time talking about and reviewing outcomes with your team
  * Describe your work in terms of desired outcomes
  * Get rid of tools that make it hard to see the “big picture”

… basically, be disciplined in the face of the overwhelming tendency to do
otherwise. Create rituals to keep you grounded. Dedicate time. Exercise the
muscle.


# Story Point Alternative: 1–3d Stories

How about splitting all user stories until they’re likely to take three or

* * *

### Story Point Alternative: 1–3d Stories

How about splitting all [user
stories](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories) until
they’re likely to take three or fewer days to complete? Let’s forget story
points. It’s worth a try. If it doesn’t work, you can try something different.

#### **Dev: Why?**

Breaking larger problems down into smaller problems is a good practice. It is
like [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) or the
[single responsibility
principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle).
Plus, you’ll never worry about story points again.

#### **Dev: But what if I get interrupted! How about meetings? We’re putting
out fires every day!**

Assume minimal interruptions (and multitasking) when scoping the story. If it
takes longer because of interruptions, then that will be a cue to the team to
make those interruptions go away. We’ll commit to removing those blockers, as
they will inevitably come up. Good job! You found a blocker.

#### **Dev: This will lead to shoddy work. We’ll rush it!**

Don’t compromise on quality. Just make the problem smaller. My guess is that
this will improve quality. And if it doesn’t, we’ll change how we work.

#### **Dev: What about story points? What about estimates?**

Focus on building the story-splitting discipline. That will trigger the
“conversations” (one benefit ascribed to estimates). You’ve already got a
small story (another benefit, as you’re supposed to “ask if you can break up
the big stories”). When estimates/forecasts are important, there are other
ways to achieve that.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*zxrNvZpuSRAadSOUUK4c2w.png)

#### Dev: Is this like that #NoEstimates thing I’ve read about?

No. It is #SmallUserStories and losing the story point estimation.

#### **Dev: But if we use “days”, people will think we’ll deliver in days!**

Yes. T-shirt sizes and the Fibonacci series are wonderfully obtuse to the
business. Days are scary. What if it takes longer? What if someone
communicates a deadline? Don’t invent practices based purely on the expected
dysfunctional behaviors of others. Days are nice and human. They correspond
with our sleep cycle. Assume a functional situation.

#### **Dev: I read **[**this quote**](http://www.agilebuddha.com/agile/agile-
estimation-9-reasons-why-you-should-use-story-points/)**, and now I’m
confused. Will this happen?**

> If the team’s ability improves to the point that what used to take two days
now takes only one, unimplemented stories with a “2 day” estimate should be
changed to “1 day”. This problem largely goes away with points.

No. Because we don’t care if it takes one day or three days. And we’re not
trying some useless effort to generate “Agile metrics” to show a manager we’re
going faster. That’s either obvious or it isn’t. We’re in the results game,
and not the velocity game. We should measure progress towards creating
positive outcomes from the business. If we need to measure anything about the
flow of work (as opposed to the outcomes we create, which of course we
measure), we’ll measure [cycle time, lead time, or cumulative
flow](https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/lean-flow-metrics/).

#### Dev: But we pair. What happens then?

Cool. Sounds like it can still take three or less days.

#### Dev: Do we still get “credit” for the points?

Credit for what? Who in your business has set up this perverse game that gives
you credit for weird fictional story points? And who punishes and DIScredits
you? Don’t worry about getting faux-credit. Let’s focus on creating results
for our customers and take credit for that.

#### **Dev: Oh geez. That will be too many stories in Jira. What a pain.**

Then use a physical board. It takes 60s to write an index card with some
acceptance criteria. Don’t use tools that slow you down.

#### **Dev: How many stories should we do each sprint? We used to add up the
points.**

Two (or three) per week sounds about right. Give it a try and we can adjust.
If you have some slack, fix something that is bugging you that makes your work
life less cool/productive/fun or working on a personal project.

#### Dev: But what if one overlaps the end of a sprint?

Good question. Maybe end the sprint a day or two later/earlier? Why are we
doing sprints anyway?

#### **Dev: But this story involves UX. They need another task, right?**

Sounds more like a three-dayer. Pair with UX on day one. Maybe test some
prototypes with a customer that afternoon. Is that difficult? Work on making
that easier.

#### **Dev: These small stories may not be independently releasable!**

That’s a great point, and I’m psyched you’re referencing
[INVEST](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/invest/). This touches “I”
ndependent (of all others), and “S” mall (so as to fit within an iteration). I
sincerely believe there is some as-of-yet named thing that is _bigger _than a
task, but is _smaller _than a user story. It can be demoed. It includes tests,
and meets acceptance criteria. It can be released in production behind a
feature-flag without failing tests. It is ready to communicate with other
services when the time comes. Anyway … point taken, but slice these _thing-
stories_ to under four days if possible.

#### **Dev: Nothing we do takes under four days!**

OK. That’s a problem, and it is a big one. Why? It is not like you’re
slacking. So … either you’re not factoring in your interruptions (see above),
your tools are lacking, your stories are too big, or you are constantly
juggling multiple stories because everything is blocked somehow.

#### **Dev: What if I can’t break this one story down to under three days?**

Don’t worry about it. This is a guideline and not a rule. Some things are big
and defy all efforts at decomposition. At least this will send up the warning
flare.

#### **Dev: But what if it ends up taking longer than three days?**

Don’t worry about it. We learn and adapt. And by all means “run with it” if
you’ve had a breakthrough and want to tear it apart and start over.

#### **Biz Person: People will always take three days! This will get abused.**

“Abuse” is a big word. So is “game the system”. Maybe, just maybe, the problem
is the system? Does your team look forward to showing up at work? Are you
asking them to be professional firefighters? Are they tasked with things that
deliver validate-able value to the business? Have you sucked the life out of
their work with mind-numbing ritual, status checks, and whip-cracking? My
observation is that people settle into gaming the system when they have no
sense of impact and momentum. What would it take for someone to excitedly
finish one story and pull the next one off the queue?

#### **Biz Person: But, but … there’s a big difference between one and three
days! If I add up all the stories I might get 30 days, or 90 days!**

Don’t worry about it. You think that will make a difference, but it won’t.
Figure 2.5d avg. and be surprised.

#### **Dev: This seems like some stupid management trick to make us work
faster.**

No one is saying work faster. Just work on smaller stories. Actually, this
“trick” is sort of pro-developer. First, I’ll never bother you with storypoint
estimation again. Second, I’ll commit to removing the blockers that make 1–3d
turnaround difficult, and get in your way. Faster isn’t the goal. Flow and
delivering continuous (validated) value is the goal. Smaller batches work.

#### **Dev: I’m not persuaded.**

Come on. I know the team cares about craftsmanship. You’ve probably even told
someone to break up classes and functions. That’s the discipline I’m talking
about. The problem is that stories become the communication layer between the
team and “the business”. That inspires all sorts of defensiveness and stress
because, let’s face it, businesses often abuse them. You’re measured by this
these things (which is stupid). They form the basis for velocity measurements
(more stupid). Put all of that aside. This is how we break down our work to
make our product great.

* * *

### Keep Features Off Your Roadmap

I received some questions this week about mission/outcome driven roadmaps.
I’ll write more in the coming weeks, but I took a quick stab…

#### **Why omit features from the roadmap?**

  * Features alone are not outcomes
  * We tend to fall in love with our ideas. What if a better solution exists?
  * Once you’ve described and shared a specific feature in a roadmap, there are few opportunities to switch things up
  * Shipping a feature is not the end of the story. Thinking in terms of features ignores challenges like adoption, validation, and iteration
  * By listing features, you are positioning the product as the order-taker
  * As the initiative progresses, you’ll be able to provide more specifics on the how/what

**Bad:**

> Add tags to work orders

**Good:**

> Help our ~7,000 in-house maintenance coordinators process work orders 50%
faster. From submission to payment-received … make it effortless, and let them
focus on finding new customers, not paperwork. No more “I’m overwhelmed, and
can’t find anything! This takes hours!”

#### **What do we do instead?**

  * Enlist teams to tackle missions and create outcomes
  * Describe roadmap as a series of missions and desired outcomes
  * Reorient organization to think about [outcomes not output](https://hbr.org/2017/02/you-need-to-manage-digital-projects-for-outcomes-not-outputs). Take the lead and set a good example by how we communicate goals
  * Move away from project terminology like Project _____, Phase, Version, etc.

**Bad:**

> User Permissions Phase 1

**Good:**

> Confident admins with an improved NPS (from 31 to 55).  
> Unblock our land-and-expand strategy by making it safe for admins to let
other internal departments start trial projects. For our 900 30+ seat
customers, increase the number of read-only trial users by 150% by end of Q3
2017

#### **Inspire Creative Solutions**

  * Avoid solutions in the roadmap. Don’t douse creativity
  * Your developers (and the rest of the org) have creative ideas as well!
  * You will learn a great deal in the early stages of the effort
  * Or, perhaps, someone will figure out how to trigger the outcome without building anything!

**Bad:**

> New Login and Onboarding Flow

**Good:**

> From “that’s interesting” to “my first book sale” in 30 minutes or less for
95% of new customers starting April 2017.

#### **The Why**

  * When someone reads the roadmap item, will they immediately grasp the why?
  * Why are we doing this? Why are we making the investment? Why us? Why now?
  * Try to encapsulate the Why in a short, tweetable blurb
  * Will this mission capture the imagination of the team?
  * Will people join you in the quest?
  * Keep testing and tweaking your roadmap missions until everyone “gets it”. This is essential. You should be able to walk up to anyone in the company, show them the roadmap, and have them grasp where you are going

**Bad:**

> Launch WidgetCo Value-Added Service

**Good:**

> Reduce the time it currently takes our customers with in-house 4–7 person
marketing departments to create and launch a campaign from 3d to &lt;1d. Move
25% of first-month trials to paying plans. Brag about it at CampaignCon 2017!

#### **The Who and New Realities**

  * Whenever possible, reference a specific customer or user segment
  * Use words that everyone will understand
  * Be specific. How would someone query for those customers/users?
  * How will their reality change? What outcomes will now become possible? What will you observe if you are successful? And no, “I’ll observing them using Feature X” is not a great answer

**Bad:**

> HopPredictor

**Good:**

> SMB beer retailer customers closing &gt;$450k in revenue, with users in our
“savvy tech adopter” category (about 40% of those customers), can expand their
businesses by an average of 8% by enhanced consumer outreach. Smarter
recommendations and reminders!

#### **Storytelling**

  * You don’t have much room on a roadmap
  * But, you can still tell short but powerful stories
  * Think about conflict, resolution, and catalysts

**Bad:**

> Harden our deployment pipeline

**Good:**

> Faster feedback. Fewer sleepless nights. Deploy code with 100% confidence
and be able to test new features with early-adopter customers in a matter of
hours not days. Reduce pager duty alerts from an average of X weekly, to Y.

* * *

#### **Should you put it on a calendar?**

  * It can be helpful to visualize the rough investment for the mission
  * Then again, you can achieve that in other ways. Putting things on a calendar can inspire some dysfunctional behavior
  * Can you extend the effort if you are seeing better than expected results?
  * Can you stop early?
  * Are you giving a false sense of “predictability” ?

#### **What else?**

  * Roadmap items should have a brief available internally
  * Don’t try to cram all of the information on to the roadmap
  * Anyone should be able to access the brief get up to speed quickly
  * Importantly, include a [cost of delay estimate](http://blackswanfarming.com/cost-of-delay/). This, in my opinion, is more important than an duration estimate for the effort
  * The brief might also cover things like: current state, success measures, how the effort will be funded, key assumptions to validate, key risks, key actors, etc. Tailor this to your situation

* * *

### Answer These 16 Questions About Your Roadmap Items

When a PM presents a roadmap, I expect them to be able to answer the following
questions about each initiative:

  1. What _exactly_ will happen if we don’t solve this problem? What will happen if we simply don’t do anything about it?
  2. How much money are we losing _each week _by not solving this problem? How does that compare to the money we are losing each week by not solving other problems?
  3. How exactly will this benefit our customers? What becomes possible? What will they be able to do more quickly, enjoyably, profitably, efficiently, accurately, etc.?
  4. Why now instead of one month, six months, or one year from now?
  5. Why _this_ instead of something else? Compare it against 3+ other potential initiatives
  6. Who will this benefit? I’m going to run a query on our user/customer list, pick up the phone, and do some research. What query do I use?
  7. What assumptions must hold true for this initiative to remain the most important thing we can work on?
  8. What could our competitors do that would render this work obsolete?
  9. How will this added complexity impact future iterations of the product?
  10. Have users adopted the last three things we have delivered? If not, why is this more important than making sure those things work?
  11. What about our current product is leaking value? Why this new thing instead of fixing that?
  12. Is this the lowest hanging fruit? If I asked your team to spend the next week fixing “small things with a big impact” would this top the list? Would it have a greater cumulative value?
  13. Can this be broken down into a set of smaller problems? What is the soonest we can get something into the hands of our customers to validate our assumptions?
  14. How do you intend to validate the direction you are taking? Can you commit to a “pivot/proceed” decision point? When will we stop iterating on this? Please draw a line in the sand
  15. Describe what failure would look like for this effort. How do you plan to make sure this either 1) happens quickly or 2) doesn’t happen?
  16. What would you try to fix if perceived blockers were not blockers? What are those blockers? If removed those blockers would you opt for that thing (the thing you believe is blocked) over this proposed initiative?


# Coherence and “Best Practices”

There are no shortage of ways. They’re everywhere.

* * *

### Coherence and “Best Practices”

There are no shortage of _ways_. They’re everywhere.

The problem is…

You can take the exact same practice, tool, or methodology … and either
bludgeon each other with it, or achieve a mutually healthy (and positive)
outcome. In some cases the bludgeoning “works”, albeit with some cognitive
dissonance and harm generated as a byproduct. But eventually you’ll need to
pay the piper.

Take a loaded word like _discipline _(and imagine some practices meant to
instill discipline):

#### **Team A:**

> We take pride in taking a **disciplined** approach! It means delivering
higher quality code, and less firefighting. When we promise something, we
don’t let people down.

#### **Team B**

> This process is killing us. Management says we need more **discipline**, but
how are we supposed to be more **disciplined** when we’re digging out from
mountains of debt, they’re interrupting us constantly, and they won’t let us
hire more people! How about their **discipline**?

**Team B** may have “consistent output” and their work may be “predictable”, but eventually you’ll encounter some issues there. Most organizations intuitively understand that they need more Team As, but have a tough time putting the pieces together to make that a reality and reflecting on what is blocking that progress.

I’m guessing you can find similar examples from your work-world for outcomes
like _accountability, safety, estimation, deadlines, commitment, velocity,
agility, engagement, continuous improvement, goal-setting_, and _compliance.
_Things can, and do, go either way. Context is everything. Helicopter
management vs. craft.

Consider [this description](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Craftsman-
Professionalism-Pragmatism-Robert/dp/0134052501) of Sandro Mancuso’s book
**The Software Craftsman: Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride:**

> If you want to develop software with pride and professionalism; love what
you do and do it with excellence; and build a career with autonomy, mastery,
and purpose, it starts with the recognition that you are a craftsman. Once you
embrace this powerful mindset, you can achieve unprecedented levels of
technical excellence and customer satisfaction

Sounds wonderful, right? If you’ve worked on the front-lines in software
development, however, you would be excused for responding…

> All that is well and good, but we are told to cut corners every day! We
don’t have autonomy!

The craft movement is interesting because, in my opinion, it is a response to
a lack of coherence in our software development organizations. As Mancuso
points out … “Agile isn’t enough!” Enough for what? Perhaps it is not enough
to reconcile the mixed messages we send our teams, or to rationalize why we
frequently cut corners. Perhaps Agile — as commonly practiced — isn’t enough
to make people feel good about their work?

And this, to me, is the central issue. It is a question of coherence. In an
incoherent organization, no “best practice” or “good tool” can be perceived as
safe or worthwhile. The front-line will be justifiably skeptical. And when it
comes to embracing potentially positive things like discipline, care, quality,
speed, etc., it will be difficult for teams to perceive these things as
something as worthwhile. Instead, the response will be to build a protective
shield and figure out how to coexist in an incoherent system.


# Your Customers Don’t Care If…

Your customers don’t care…

* * *

### Your Customers Don’t Care If…

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UotwyMbFZS0LT1sEPs4pmg.png)

Your customers don’t care…

  * if you call it an epic, user story, task, subtask, or to-do
  * if your ticket statuses are updated by end-of-day
  * how (or if) you estimate your stories
  * about your team’s “[Adherence to Scrum Rules or Actual Stories Completed](http://pragmaticmarketing.com/resources/9-scrum-metrics-to-keep-your-team-on-track)”
  * about how you format your user stories
  * about how your individual contributors receive “credit” for their work, or whether they meet their output commitments
  * whether you scale with SAFe, or LeSS, or Nexus, or GROWS, or DAD, or “The Spotify Method”

Your customers **DO CARE** about your ability to continuously deliver value,
and to adapt to their changing needs.

Oftentimes we put doing the method, practice, or tool ahead of delivering
value to our customers. We strive to do “it” well, without asking whether “it”
actually benefits our customers (and our teams). Consultants sell “it”,
authors write about “it”, we implement “it” or do an “it” transformation, and
then pat ourselves on the back for being kickass it-ilists. Mission
accomplished.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m feel blessed to have so many “its” at my disposal!
However…

We _should_ hire these methods, practices, and tools to help us deliver more
value to our customers. Figure out what works, and do it. Yet often the needs
we seek to fulfill are purely internal. The practices act as trust and safety
proxies. They buffer departments and silos, let teams interface with the
“business”, give the illusion of accountability, add a veneer of measurement,
and temper the fear that things aren’t under control.

So the next time you’re debating the details of a certain “it”, step back and
think about your customers and your frontline teams. Is the “it” doing its
job?

### Kanban Method: Be Careful About Your Board’s Scope

When using the [Kanban Method](http://www.djaa.com/principles-general-
practices-kanban-method), one of the toughest dilemmas is figuring out how far
to the left and right to extend the board, and how to handle outside resource
dependencies.

In theory, you are supposed to “start with what you do now”. Where you are now
might involve a broad sphere of interaction. Some examples might include:

  * The availability of your UX resource is dictated by his involvement with other dev teams
  * Your team requires Ops involvement to deploy features to production
  * Far upstream, one of your team members is called on to provide an estimate
  * A portfolio planning process “cues up” your next “project”
  * UX “gets ahead” of some work
  * Far downstream, a customer provides feedback. Turns out you missed the mark
  * You need another team to review your PRs to their service
  * Someone in procurement has to sign off on a contract for a new monitoring tool

For the systems thinkers among us, it can be tempting to push to visualize
everything. Try it, and you’ll soon figure out the risks involved.

I remember the first time I walked over to an epic kanban board with a ball of
string and some tape and added some portfolio planning steps to the left, a
bunch of dependencies (with the string) to the middle, and some validation
steps to the right culminating with “delivered desired outcome”.

A shitstorm swept in from across the building. What I added was technically
correct — I was starting with what we did now — but seeing it up on the wall
inspired some heated arguments. Down came the board.

Why? In this case, the kanban board inspired some cognitive dissonance. It was
widely circulated that front-line teams were “autonomous” and in full control
of their destiny. The reality was a little messier. For example, there was an
upstream analysis/validation phase that lacked visibility, and meant that
teams were frequently surprised with new projects. The fact that this was
happening was not a secret. But seeing it in all its glory got people fired up
(both managers and engineers).

Organizations and individuals tend to assume a strange equilibrium around
resource constraints, impediments, toxic people, inexperienced teams,
handoffs, big batches, high utilization, and long feedback loops. There may be
a gradual “drift into failure” ([see Sidney Dekker](https://www.amazon.com
/Drift-into-Failure-Components-Understanding/dp/1409422216)), but for the most
part people pragmatically absorb the challenge. After a certain point, you
stop making a fuss and do your best.

My advice is to be very, very cautious about boiling the ocean. Take small
steps to indicate the dependencies while resisting the urge to visualize the
work of other teams/individuals/resources. Figure out how to visualize points
“off the board” (these can literally be nodes, lanes, stickies, etc.) without
threatening people.


# Tools: Complexity Enablers

Tools and process can help you manage complexity. But they also can serve as a
complexity enabler.

### Tools: Complexity Enablers

Tools and process can help you manage complexity. But they also can serve as a
complexity enabler.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TLNz6qPgVVl7WHHJJfnFjQ.png)

<https://www.seriouspuzzles.com/krypt-silver-654pc-hard-jigsaw-puzzle-by-
ravensburger.html>

Take the ability in [Atlassian](https://medium.com/u/5aa6b9976187)’s Jira to
add dependencies between tickets across projects. This allows you to create
many interrelated projects, and to coordinate activities across teams, but it
doesn’t answer whether having those dependencies is a good idea. And it
certainly doesn’t put pressure on you to remove them.

Consider the impact of having a team of project managers available to manage
“complex projects” that span departments, locales, teams, silos, etc. Sure,
this oversight might be important. But it also incentivizes the organization
to take on complex projects when they might not be necessary, and to
institutionalize hand-offs and larger batches. The projects may run
“smoothly”, but it doesn’t mean the arrangement is ideal or resilient to
future challenges.

How could those efforts be mediated automatically / with technology vs. a
human coordination layer? How could you have _mostly _autonomous, two pizza
sized teams?

Other examples come to mind like your org chart, reporting structures, scaling
agile frameworks, tools for creating high fidelity prototypes/wireframes, and
certain programming languages / development frameworks. Or something as simple
as a having a team of on-call firefighters to keep your product from falling
apart.

Even continuous delivery can encourage the buildup of complexity beyond our
ability to tame it.

My point isn’t that these things aren’t effective. They are … to a point. But
they can blind you to growing complexity, and lull you into not resolving the
buildup of complexity in how you work or decoupling units of complexity.
Before you know it you’re drowning in complexity, and your systems are ill-
prepared to deal with it.

So: always keep in mind how you can battle complexity, create team autonomy,
and work down the various forms of debt (including learning, technical,
organizational, etc.)


# Destroy Your Product (Without Getting Fired)

Can you destroy your product AND not get fired?

* * *

### Destroy Your Product (Without Getting Fired)

Can you destroy your product AND not get fired?

The reality is that you WILL NOT get fired or risk career advancement if you:

  * Are “responsive” to the business
  * Ship something quickly (provided things don’t blow up)
  * Work around constraint and bottlenecks (instead of attacking them)
  * Work within your scope of control and influence
  * Represent the interests of your functional silo
  * Raise the profile of your functional silo, increase reliance on your functional silo
  * Deliver on a consensus driven initiative. Deliver on the HiPPOs silver bullet
  * Hit a widely socialized goal or target. Or better yet beat the goal
  * Add debt that is not immediately quantifiable
  * Optimize for your individual performance plan
  * Highlight the positives
  * Demonstrate you are fulfilling your “side of the bargain”

You can be _awesome_ at the above AND do harm to the global whole. Taking care
of the global whole is a thorny business. The reality is that you risk getting
fired (and risking your career advancement) if you:

  * Tell the business “no”
  * Delay shipping something due to quality or value concerns
  * Take time to address the root cause of a constraint, or swarm the bottleneck
  * Ruffle feathers outside of your immediate scope of influence
  * Point out that the interests of your functional silo do not align with business goals
  * Decrease reliance on your functional silo
  * Challenge consensus driven decisions. Ignore the HiPPO’s silver bullet
  * Ignore a goal that ceases to be helpful
  * Challenge adding complexity to the product unless it adds a value multiple. Challenge the necessity for a project
  * Highlight the negatives

For an example, consider this quote from a Director of Engineering:

> All we hear about is how engineering is slow, and how we need to be more
predictable. At the end of the day I need to be responsive. That’s how I’m
measured, even if we deliver a ton of crap. Of course I’m interested in
business results, but I can always blame product for poor product decisions if
we do our part.

Note how doing “our part” comes before business goals. Can you blame them? Ask
“what’s wrong” to a cross-section of employees at a company, and you’ll hear
things like:

  * Engineering is too slow
  * Ops didn’t plan correctly
  * Product is running a feature factory
  * Sales is selling the roadmap

It’s easy to isolate blame to a particular group, but in my experience the
efforts of other groups to circumvent the constraints/bottleneck create
problems that are equally as damaging. The “problem” is more one of how to
approach global continuous improvement, and not the problem of an individual
subsystem.

How can you make it safe for your team to optimize for global health and
outcomes over individual or group interests?


# “Is My Dev Team Slacking?”

If you can’t tell … you have no business asking.

### “Is My Dev Team Slacking?”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cEQmXTo8DetpCGjm-3UmXg.png)

If you can’t tell … you have no business asking.

If you can’t tell … no amount of story-point estimation, rigorous sprint
planning, measuring velocity, comparing team velocities, or daily check-ins
will give you the answer.

Skilled developers know if their teammates are slacking. It’s there in the
code, in the tests, and in the code reviews. Whether they share that
information openly is another question.

If you are _not_ a skilled developer, don’t bother trying to figure out if
your team is slacking. Your data will be inconclusive. Work to create an
environment where teammates 1) have a reason to be motivated, and 2) have the
requisite safety to hold each other accountable for doing right by their
fellow teammates.

Ask “what is holding us back from doing our best work” and pay attention.
There’s often a story there. Build trust.

And/or learn to be a software developer.

### PMs: Try This Thought Experiment

The following question/though experiment is a great conversation starter for
product managers and other stakeholders. The deeper you go, the more valuable
it gets.

> What if the team simply stopped adding new complexity to your product? What
exactly would happen? When?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*C6OZwtnTYT6fVtzO3LHeJQ.png)

<http://past1978.deviantart.com/art/Destroyed-factory-175203951>

This is an interesting question for a couple reasons. First, you begin to
realize how obsessed we are about output. The scenario itself makes us
uncomfortable.

Sadly, some teams are severely restricted in their ability to deliver value
(because of debt, high utilization, fighting fires, lack of autonomy,
dependencies, etc.) Teams often reply with “that is a batshit crazy,
unreasonable scenario”, only to admit that they haven’t delivered anything of
validateable value for months (or years).

Other teams “build and release stuff”, but have a loose grasp on the economic
impacts they generate. This is where the question is useful. The idea that
you’d build less is anathema to product development teams, but keep in mind
that this is a _thought experiment_.

How would your organization be impacted financially as time passed?

  * What would happen to your balance sheet and income statement? Why?
  * When would customers churn? Why?
  * How would your market share change? Why?
  * What would happen to NPS scores? Why?
  * How would your relationship with your investor(s) change?
  * How would your marketing strategy change and adapt?
  * How would your long term growth potential; change?

You might end up with things like “well, by Q3 we will lose $1.2m in new sales
because we don’t offer the Widget X feature”_. _That is a helpful data point,
and something worth talking about (and exploring the assumptions linking the
feature to the revenue). You’ll also hear remarks like:

  * We will lose the confidence of our investors if we don’t innovate
  * NPS scores would drift slightly downwards, hitting ## by Q1 2018. It would likely be because ___________, and would cost us $____________
  * Competitor X will start stealing our customers, because _____________ The impact would be $____________ .
  * We will miss an opportunity to create an ecosystem worth $2.5m if we don’t act before ____________ enters the market in Q2 2018

With each item try to provide a date, an economic impact, and some possible
causes. Test that story with other stakeholders. What are other ways you could
mitigate/accentuate that impact (especially important when someone is stuck on
a specific feature). This is a great exercise to fuel discussions about [cost
of delay](http://blackswanfarming.com/cost-of-delay/).

When you do this exercise with many teams, you’ll start to notice some
similarities and patterns. Teams are …

  * programmed to build, and obsessed with output … down to our project lists, backlogs, celebrations, reporting structures, etc.
  * don’t consider the economic impact of their work
  * talk about “value” in prioritization, but don’t quantify it
  * nervous about estimating value for things like customer experience / satisfaction
  * build features that don’t need to be built right now
  * parallelize efforts, when there would be more economic benefit to focus
  * teams build too much, and add too much complexity
  * are bogged down in complexity
  * have acclimated to a level of value delivery that is not economically viable
  * don’t ask: “how could we achieve the same outcomes by building less”
  * are frequently called in for “optics” work (investors, partners, etc.). This is very common in the startup world
  * don’t talk about the economic impacts of technical debt

Give it a try. What did you end up talking about? Once you’ve quantified your
baseline economic impacts, how can you go about creating those impacts by
adding as little complexity as possible to your product?


# 5 Product Development Questions

A little kanban with your morning coffee.

### 5 Product Development Questions

#### A little kanban with your morning coffee.

I like using kanban boards to think about product development questions. I
like kanban boards because they are a complete blank slate. You can model
Scrum with a kanban board, or you can model a typical d-thinking process. Or
roll your own.

And when it stops working — provided you aren’t knee deep in a digital tool —
you can just change it.

Here are a couple questions from this morning’s brainstorm.

#### **Question #1: What is Done?**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LYbaaauE3re4ysBYiXJAbQ.png)

Some systems help us track the _work_. Some systems help us visualize _value
delivery_. Done is an elusive concept. Tools tend to be designed around
tracking work, instead of tracking our progress towards outcomes. We have
trouble visualizing these in parallel.

How we solve this problem — who sees what and how often — has a profound
impact on our product development teams.

#### Question: Do Sprints obscure the actual work?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Nqypr4NRqJejtb1lhaSsXQ.png)

What do we optimize for on the left? How about on the right? Why do these feel
different when they _could_ be similar? The option on the right feels
nebulous. Who owns what? How does this work with Sprints? The option on the
left feels overly restrictive and too siloed.

But in a quest for efficiency, many teams opt for the left option, yet track
that work in a separate system. Why? Scrum focuses on the dev’s In Progress.
Are you letting your tools and process run your team, or the other way around?

#### **Question #3: Is this a pull system?**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2piaalX3reEq-7U3yVXzfQ.png)

Work moves from left to right… right? Well not really. This is a pull system.
An unmet need (a customer “order”), triggers the need to produce something
until that need is met. Are you pushing or pulling? What constitutes an
“order”?

In a push system, we’ll focus on a big list of projects that have to be moved
through the system (pushing features on to customers). In a pull system, we’ll
focus on triggering work to deliver a specific customer need.

#### Question #4: Should we include downstream steps? Why? Why not?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VWRpPQa_TwF624C8ECUV4w.png)

Out of sight, out of mind! Right? Marking the item Complete in Jira does carry
a certain sense of satisfaction, but there is more to go. At this point, the
work has no value. No value has been exchanged. Consider why you do/don’t
picture all of the downstream steps. It’s messy, for sure. But does it need to
be that way?

#### Question #5: What constitutes a team?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*D1-e_0S4xFwZ64ErzLUEOA.png)

Is this one or two teams? It might be more convenient to view this as two
teams, but in reality it is one team. How does calling it two teams help us?

### Feedback Loops and “Done”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7bPqmYF457WD2gRRsDX_nQ.jpeg)

Some teams just assume that fast feedback is impossible. It is more like
build, build, build — maybe measure — learn eventually. Perhaps they deliver
an enterprise product, and the thought of “experimenting” on their customers
feels too risky and expensive. Or maybe they lack the tooling, autonomy, and
schedule flexibility. The end result is that it feels very inefficient to
“wait around” after the “project is complete”. So it is on to the next
“project”, and the business (hopefully) commits to monitoring the impact of
the work and prioritizing follow-up work should it be required.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KmGlOcCdRELK0a0kQEW1lA.png)

This is where Agile — even when perfectly implemented on the delivery side —
fails to address the bigger picture of fast feedback and iterative
development. Imagine if someone said “and now we are going to have a five
month sprint to get feedback” … the team would cringe! Yet that is exactly
what happens when you ship work into the abyss. **We add complexity without
validating that added complexity. **Yes, in theory you are delivering
customer-facing value with each sprint…but are you getting feedback with each
sprint?

When teams talk about velocity, they rarely talk about the velocity of
learning and/or feedback. If you think about lead time as the time from idea
conception, to the customer “accepting the order” (or the work adding the
desired value), you’ll typically see that the touch time for development is
just a small fraction of the overall cycle.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*y37ClzB4RNwhgmOQEMY41A.png)

Let’s say that a CEO dreams up a silver bullet in January, teams obsess over
planning and research between February and May, the dev team works on the idea
between May and June (while doing three other things in parallel), and ships
it July 1st. Six months later, the response from customers is tepid, and it
looks like the work missed its mark. In terms of lead time, the feature is
still pending. It has been a year and one month, and it is still “In
Progress”.

Since developer time is theoretically the limiter, what companies do is work
hard to land work on this precious resource in the most efficient manner
possible. They build incentives around this. They create department goals
around this. They build complex dashboards and project plans around this. They
obsess about relative prioritization. They enlist less precious resources to
prepare the work beforehand.

If there’s one thing that [the feedback to my feature factory
post](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-
44a5b938d6a2#.mgls9o4es) taught me, it is that organizations optimize around
delivery (not validation) in very deep and complex ways. The approach becomes
deeply rooted in the company culture, including how it celebrates and rewards
people. The company literally runs in execution mode until things stop
working, heads roll, they re-org, and the process repeats itself.

And it is not just individual organizations. Whole industries exist to sell
ways to “get it right” before shipping, and make sure teams “make their
commitments”.

There are, of course, powerful ways to reduce risk early in the product
development cycle without pushing features live and measuring impact. This
post is by no means an attack on those methods. Even still, [few plans survive
first contact with the enemy](http://www.lexician.com/lexblog/2010/11/no-
battle-plan-survives-contact-with-the-enemy/). Probably more important is that
without feedback, teams are not able to meaningfully iterate and knock off any
low hanging fruit that emerges from “first contact”. Months later the context
has changed, the research is stale, and the cost of reengaging is high. **But
this approach _feels _like the economically optimal decision given perceived
constraints.**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qUSb3j0w6J43oVPSwC9xaA.png)

And that’s the point of this post … to encourage you to question your
constraints.

  * Are your constraints around customer feedback set in stone? Are they non-negotiable?
  * Do your competitors operate under the same constraints?
  * How much money are you _losing_ by waiting to refine your work?
  * How much money are you _making_ by moving on to new projects?
  * Do you actually go back and close the loop with regards to the impact of your work?
  * If so, how do you do that? How regularly? How rigorously?
  * If so, what is your batting average? What are some good / bad product decisions you’ve made in the last two years?
  * How could you speed up feedback loops such that it would make economic sense to let teams iterate based on feedback? Are there ways to reduce that risk?
  * How could you take small steps to change the organization’s focus from output to outcomes? What’s working? Where?]

Is this impossible?

### Psychological safety: the secret weapon of awesome teams

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*m1vB-OyPvyKNmn_AhKuwyw.png)

The other day I found myself fixating on the word _discipline_. An engineer
friend and I were chatting about what made a great software developer. We
agreed that discipline (along with dedication, skills, patience, etc.) was a
key ingredient.

However, I couldn’t shake a flashback from earlier in my career when an angry
engineering director reamed his team for a lack of discipline (while
simultaneously avoiding the fact that the team was getting peppered with
distractions). Context is everything. Discipline can be something teams aspire
to and take pride in. Or it can be an empty admonition.

The key differentiator is [psychological
safety](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-
its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=0) (and by extension trust).
Without safety, concepts like accountability, continuous improvement, and
goals are difficult to discuss. Safety unlocks the ability for the team to
reflect, take on difficult challenges, and have difficult discussions.

Below I look at words we throw around in product development through two
different lenses:

  * **Low Trust / Low Safety (LTLS)**
  * **High Trust / High Safety (HTHS)**

By looking at these side by side, I hope you’ll consider how you can create
more psychological safety on your teams. It truly changes the game.

#### Estimates

> LTLS: Why can’t the team meet its commitments? Why are they always slacking?
We need to spend more time **estimating**, apparently, and even then they game
the system.

> HTHS: We sat down and **estimated** the value of a couple efforts, and got a
rough sense of how long they’d take. From there we put together a backlog
folks were comfortable with

#### Discipline

> LTLS: The team needs more **discipline**! It’s like herding cats here!

> HTHS: I appreciate Mary’s **discipline** when it comes to writing tests. It
really helps me out. As a team we take pride in our discipline and
craftsmanship.

#### Accountability

> LTLS: The team takes advantage of the system. No one is held
**accountable**! If we could just do what we say we will do, things would be
better.

> HTHS: Everyone pulls their weight. I can trust my teammates to do their
work. When the going is tough, I ask my teammates to hold me **accountable**.

#### Improvement

> LTLS: Unless the team **improves**, we’ll be in deep shit. Why don’t they
take the initiative?

> HTHS: We are always looking for ways to continuously **improve**. That’s
part of the fun.

#### Efficiency

> LTLS: There has to be a way to eek more out of our teams. Why can’t they
work more **efficiently**?

> HTHS: If we automate that, it will let us deliver more **efficiently**, and
be more confident. We are always looking for ways to streamline.

#### Time Management

> LTLS: I can’t believe you guys wasted time on trying to fix that! We need
better **time management** here. Where are your hours actually going?

> HTHS: I appreciate that our scrum master helps make our meetings worthwhile,
and worth the time investment. I’ve never been great at **time management**

#### Coaching

> LTLS: If you can’t improve with some **coaching**, you’ll be at risk of not
meeting your performance targets

> HTHS: Our Agile **coach** has helped us build important skills. When we need
something, they are there to help.

#### Speed

> LTLS: More velocity! I can’t understand why the team is so slow. If you
can’t **speed** up we will never meet this deadline!

> HTHS: We are able to get feedback quickly, which lets us move quickly. I’m
proud of how fast we move and learn. **Speed** is an asset.

#### Quality

> LTLS: Another bug in product! What is up with all of these **quality**
issues?

> HTHS: The team takes pride in the **quality** of our work. Quality is very
important. When something goes wrong, we drop what we’re doing and fix it.

#### Teamwork

> LTLS: Why aren’t you swarming on issues? Why don’t you act like a team?
Where is the **teamwork** ? Why aren’t we faster?

> HTHS: We pair, swarm, and help each other out when we need to. And measure
ourselves based on how the team does as a whole. **Teamwork** is very
important to us

#### Flexibility

> LTLS: I know we are short-staffed at the moment, and I know you are fire-
fighting, but I need you to be more _f_**_lexible_**.

> HTHS: When we are faced with new challenges, we have the freedom to be
**flexible**. The process isn’t set in stone.

#### Goals

> HTHS: I have to create daily and weekly **goals** for the team, or they’ll
just slack. We need to keep cracking the whip.

> LTLS: Having personal and team** goals** helps us stay on track. I like how
my teammates aren’t afraid to set stretch goals.

The angry engineering director I mentioned in the introduction was never able
to establish psychological safety on his team. This made it impossible for the
team to discuss things like time management, accountability, and goal setting
in a positive light. The mere mention of a word like _accountability — _even
between team members, outside of the manager’s earshot _— _set off the alarm
bells, and the team justifiably shut down.

Meanwhile, my engineer friend I mentioned at the beginning of this story
established a craftsmanship guild in his company, and the word discipline is
elevated and discussed frequently.

I’ll leave you with a handy cheat-sheet that summarizes the HTHS vs. LTLS
comparisons I made above. Stay safe out there.

### Everything Is Fucked Up. And We Love It

When it comes to our work, organizations, and teams…

Do we get attached to _drama_? Are we addicted to the _rush_? Does functional
feel _boring_? Is the refrain “all companies are fucked up in some way” a
_self-fulfilling prophecy_?

> Drama causes the pituitary gland and hypothalamus to secrete endorphins,
which are the pain-suppressing and pleasure-inducing compounds, which heroin
and other opiates mimic. ([source](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog
/obesely-speaking/201411/excessive-attention-seeking-and-drama-addiction))

What is your personal work mindset optimized for? How about your team and
department? How about your company leaders? Are organizations, [as Craig
Larmen points
out](http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/index.php?title=Larman%27s_Laws_of_Organizational_Behavior):

> …implicitly optimized to avoid changing the status quo middle- and first-
level manager and “specialist” positions &amp; power structures.

Consider the following hits of adrenaline. Do they benefit the system as a
whole?

  * High stakes horse trading and the rush of getting a big project “funded”

  * Heroic firefighting and thwarting impending disaster
  * Being right. Having the “best idea”
  * Getting the headcount during the annual planning process
  * Closing the deal. Winning the bakeoff
  * Confirming our belief that “all companies are fucked up”
  * Shipping the silver bullet, and the success theater that follows
  * Being the first person to use sexy new technology in production
  * Saving the day with your genius commit
  * Having a problem to fix. Being a “critical part” of the solution
  * Fixing the problem you identified (regardless of whether it was the actual problem)
  * Reply all
  * The “crazy startup life” … things are “literally breaking apart before our eyes”
  * Having everything under control. Knowing exactly what is going on
  * Rocking the boat. Shaking things up. Gutting it. Starting it over
  * Rewriting someone’s “crappy code”
  * Saying no, because you can
  * Beating the odds. Making the risky bet
  * Exposing the flaw in someone’s reasoning
  * Watching something implode, saying “I told you so”, and then fixing it
  * Letting someone fail, and then taking their job
  * Always being in the loop
  * Navigating political intrigue, and amassing political capital
  * Taking credit for a change initiative. Doing it your way
  * “Crazy hours”
  * Crazy output, flying, moving fast
  * Nailing the deadline on the nose. “It came down to the final hour …”
  * Making yourself indispensable in the new process
  * Raising the profile of your effort/team/domain
  * Forming a bond around mutual discontent. Complaining about ineptitude. Plotting

### Putting a Cost On Debt

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*QzOJ6QxTmiUWQt7RK2WLxw.png)

<http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2011/11/bbc_weather_design_refresh.html>

Dev teams often struggle with persuading the business to prioritize debt work-
down and complexity/risk management. The shiny efforts with a promised link to
revenue win, and the maintenance work loses. This continues until some sort of
embarrassing catastrophic failure, at which point — if it is not to late — the
business loses time/money/marketshare trying to fix the issue retroactively.
Some companies never regain their full health.

What fascinates me is what happens _before_ this pivotal “oh shit” moment. In
the trenches there is typically some awareness of the problem. Engineers
struggle. Customers experience stability and quality issues. The pace of
feature development and value delivery slows. But … nothing happens (or at
least nothing that addresses the root cause). Even when there are some
grumblings, it never seems to escalate in a meaningful way. Why?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Av_jv6UYzKlnUISc8DLbCw.png)

<https://www.reference.com/science/causes-ocean-pollution-8626fe75f49962e>

In addition to simply having higher priority (or seemingly higher priority)
things to work on, there is a tendency to look elsewhere for a fix. Maybe it
is the product/project management process? Maybe it is a question of staffing,
team structure, or the development practices? Maybe some new silver-bullet
technology or tool will save the day? Accumulated complexity is often the
trigger for this common plea:

> We have no predictability! We have no accountability! Things are out of
control

We go to great ends to persuade ourselves that we don’t need to slow down.
I’ll always remember this CEO freakout moment:

> Damnit team! Why can’t we fix these problems AND grow? Are we incapable of
doing two things at once? Can’t we find _a way_?

Unfortunately, these fixes — along with the requisite silver bullets to keep
momentum — tend to just obfuscate the problem further. Companies will fire,
hire, and even re-org, before stepping back and saying “shit, we need to spend
some time working down debt”. And that’s one of the crazy twists here: the
amount of money (and pain, and disruption) spent to avoid the problem
typically far outweighs the cost of addressing the problem. Anything that
detracts from the outward perception of forward progress and momentum is too
unsavory to try.

A common argument against the prioritization of debt work-down is as follows:

> But it is so hard to put a price tag on this!

I respectfully disagree. It is _easy to estimate and measure this_, and
accurately describe how increased complexity is slowing down the team. The
leading indicators are out there. You have N sensors working on the front-
line, who will — given safety — let you know when flow is dropping. I have
NEVER experienced a situation where there wasn’t a good deal of advance notice
about an impending issue. The same goes for monitoring and visualizing system
complexity. The data is available.

Or backing up even further… the assumptions around cost of delay/cost of
addressing debt are typically as robust and solid as our assumptions about new
revenue/new features. PMs are routinely 2–4x off their impact estimates. So
you only need to be as accurate

What is _hard_ is the following:

  1. Build the trust and discipline among front-line teams to measure lead time, touch time, cycle time, dependencies, etc.
  2. Trust the front-line teams, and create a safe environment for them to raise the red-flag. When they do raise the red flag… do something about it!
  3. Swallow your pride and admit that something is “broken” (even when you were expressly asked not to focus on fixing it)
  4. Put a dollar figure on it.

How do you put a dollar figure on it? Imagine that your company wants to keep
releasing new features at a rapid pace. Complexity is increasing non-linearly.
Adding people to the problem costs money (and doubling resources doesn’t
create 2x the velocity). What would it cost you to _simply maintain_ your
value delivery rate assuming you don’t battle back complexity? That cost will
go up non-linearly.

Now, imagine you hit the wall and have to essentially _stop_ new feature
development. What would that cost your business? How about a conservative 3x
lead time increase (not unheard of)? How about the cost of simultaneously
running a big refactor / debt work-down alongside your current new feature
development efforts?

Assume you are struggling with debt now. What would you spend **RIGHT NOW** if
you could increase your new feature velocity by 3x (_without new hires_) AND
prevent that cost from increasing non-linearly? Of course, this isn’t how we
typically see the problem. We increase our spending on new resources, new
processes, new tools, and shiny new efforts because that _feels_ more
proactive, and is easier to swallow.

So, in closing I’d like to leave you with a couple key points:

  1. Battling back complexity is a business-altering challenge
  2. We’re programmed to gloss over the issue (behavioral economics FTW)
  3. We frequently miscast the issue as another set of problems. Solving those problems simply distracts us from the core issue
  4. Figuring out the cost of complexity is on par with making revenue projections. It is possible. You don’t need to be terribly accurate, either.
  5. You will need to create a safe/trusting environment for your front-line contributors. They’ll sense the problem early, but will be hesitant to push back if there’s a penalty for “going slow”
  6. The key impact is that lead time will slow. This is easier to wrap your head around than, let’s say, the impact of quality issues (unless customers are leaving in droves). So drive that impact home


# Roots of the Feature Factory (1/n)

What are the roots of the feature factory approach?

* * *

### Roots of the Feature Factory (1/n)

What are the roots of the [feature factory](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-
youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2) approach?

You can often trace it back to how efforts are funded, and how managers/team
members are incentivized…

* * *

#### Executive

I expect everyone to advocate passionately for their ideas! What should we do?
What should we build? Where should we go? If you want your project funded, you
better be ready to make the pitch! We need a bias for action here.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NKvT9Oehdh_uRelqjRb5UA.png)

#### PM

I’m not sure we actually agree on the desired outcome here. I advocate for us
exploring what success would look like and building a shared understanding of
the problem. How would we know if things were working? How will we inspire
novel solutions from the team? Ideas are kind of cheap…

#### Executive

But what does that get us? I need to report to the board on what we plan to
do, and how we will spend their money. Face it, people want solutions and they
love a good plan. If we don’t get our annual project list done soon, we’ll
look completely unprepared. You’re up against some big players here in terms
of finding resources and funding. So what’s your plan? Just high level please
… I don’t need the nitty gritty.

#### PM

Well, we’ve got a list of things that have a decent shot of driving the
outcome you and I discussed. Some are small, so we’d like to try those first.
Some are bigger and riskier. Again, I’m not sure we all agree on the desired
outcome…

#### Executive

What about the machine learning one? That was really good…

#### PM

Um, yeah, well that one is pretty big. But …

#### Executive

But if you want the resources, you’ll need to be think big and be bold. “Just
trying stuff” doesn’t really resonate. And you’ve got to consider optics as
well. Sales has been chomping at the bit for something new. It’ll give you a
chance to build some bridges with the data science team as well … and everyone
knows they are in demand. A partnership!

Unless there’s a story, I’m not sure we can get you the engineering resources
you need. You need a win here to advance your case…

#### PM

Of course I want the team to win, but sales having something new is a
different outcome, right? What about our current product makes it hard to
sell?

We had discussed the outcome of reducing churn, and very few people are
churning because we aren’t using ML here. I don’t want to add all of that
complexity either… ops will get killed trying to maintain it all.

#### Executive

Oh, you have a lot to learn! You have to figure out which game you’re playing.
OK, so the machine learning thing… we discussed that after the offsite last
week and…

* * *

Sound familiar? How many issues can you spot?

There’s no silver bullet to defeat this kind of thinking. You have to be
prepared to fight and show results. In my experience, the only way to change
this mindset is to show that the alternative “works”. Elaborate planning and
big batches are frequently a proxy for trust and confidence. Perhaps…

  * Propose experimenting with incremental outcome-based funding
  * Stay on message. Continuously report on outcomes. It will put pressure on other teams to do the same
  * Use projects as a trojan horse for missions. Remove feature names from project titles. Stick with the desired outcome

If you are a leader/executive and you’re reading this, take a hard look at how
you incentivize your team, and the degree to which your current planning
process promotes batch sizes and silver bullets.

# When Your Head Hurts

* * *

### When Your Head Hurts

Your head hurts. It’s hard to understand all of the moving parts. Meetings go
in circles. You feel like you are playing a game of three-dimensional chess on
a rocking boat, jet-lagged, with your hands tied behind your back. There’s
progress, but it is extremely painful.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*N4jl46UFv6nC85q-HxVMrg.png)

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_chess#Star_Trek_Tri-
Dimensional_Chess>

The interesting thing here is that with great cognitive force and fortitude we
can “manage” these situations. Throw enough people and process at the problem
and you can, at least for a short period of time, establish some sense of
“control”. When this state starts to pervade how we conceive of our work (“how
things work”), you simply stop noticing. It manifests as low/mid level
institutionalized anxiety.

Contrast this with situations that are challenging, but feel invigorating and
energizing (frequently referred to as [flow
states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29)). These
situations aren’t _easy_ but the sensation is different. Most product
development teams know that sense of confusion at the start of an initiative.
You go in circles, make mistakes, and struggle for shared understanding. But
there’s still movement. The way forward emerges from the fog, and you find
your groove (until the next big challenge).

One mode feels like being a member of a [Co Op board in
NYC](https://www.habitatmag.com/Publication-Content/2010/2010-May/Web-
Exclusives/Bad-Boards-Co-op-Horror-Stories). The other mode feels like
climbing Everest. “Hey people this is insane. People climb ****ing Everest,
and we can’t figure this co-op shit out?!!?”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*R7TpmJCS-0BC4e-jOKlKMA.png)

<http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/everest/gear-edmund-hillary-
hilaree-oneill/#/49925.jpg>

When I hear people complain about a lack of process, ownership,
accountability, predictability, or discipline, I immediately suggest taking a
step back and thinking about flow. In our quest for certainty we tend to adopt
layers of process/control that, while providing a safety blanket, do little to
forward our end goal(s). Worse still is that we equate “real” business (or
“real world business”) with these impediments.

In this mindset, the quest for execution, accountability, and predictability
supersedes actual outcomes. This kicks off a wicked cycle where outcomes are
lacking, and more management/complexity is added to solve the problem. We try
to cure the symptoms.

I always ask teams:

  * What is the wedge we could drive into this problem such that we could stop talking, and start doing?
  * What constraints are we actually operating under? Why? Can these be removed?
  * How does this experience compare to your most rewarding work-related flow states ? Why can’t it be like that?

These days it is common to describe our environments as “complex”. But it is
important to remember that complexity does not doom us to cognitive overload
or a _complicated_ approach. Complexity is not an excuse. It is an opportunity
for innovation.

When your head hurts …. that’s a sign. You’re not addressing the root cause.
Take a step back. Observe. Save yourself from burnout. Speak up. Figure out
how to achieve flow. Figure out how to climb a mountain, instead of navigate a
maze.

# “I Hate Kanban…”

Wandering the conference halls I overhear…

* * *

### “I Hate Kanban…”

Wandering the conference halls I overhear…

> Yeah. Kanban sucks. I hate it! Didn’t change anything …

Forget for a moment that you can model anything with Kanban (it is “way”
agnostic)…

I’ve been fascinated by something lately. When given the path to visualize
work and make working agreements explicit, so many many organizations balk.
Why? Why would we opt _against_ continuous improvement? Why, if given an
option, would we adopt the most complicated and heavy processes (and hire
droves of project managers), but hesitate to make work visual?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GHOK9W2JZBJzWI-rGXbkdg.png)

By visualizing work on a Kanban board (for example), you are able to visualize
…

  * The pet hippo projects and fast-track. The side-channel work requests. Cost of maintaining/servicing delivered capabilities
  * The bottlenecks. Which brings up all sorts of questions about skills, resources, employee engagement (or lack thereof), discipline, output etc.
  * The difference between where we need resources vs. where we’d like to hire resources
  * The stuff we do to hold shit together, but that we’re too embarrassed to admit
  * Perpetual over-utilization and the difference between business and flow
  * Heroics, and the dark side of heroics (errors, rework, burning out)
  * What actually constitutes done? More importantly … who owns that? Who defines that?
  * The dependencies we don’t want to admit or claim don’t exist. “We only rely on them _sometimes”. _“That is fully automated now, just like we promised”
  * The delta between estimates and actual lead time / cycle time
  * What it actually takes to get things done … the rework, back and forth, swarming etc.
  * The cost of multitasking vs. our desire to be proactive and responsive
  * The impact of increased complexity. No one wants to admit that what they are doing is slowing down the whole ship

The trepidation make sense.

Shining the mirror back on an organization is painful. It very quickly exposes
all sorts of human issues. It is these human issues that typically block
change.

You end up returning to the same “problems” over and over. There are _never
_enough resources. There is _always_ a jockeying for resources. There will
_always_ be tension between local and global optimization. We are human: we
over-promise and are eager to please, and fall victim to all sorts of
cognitive biases. So at the core you have two mindsets at either end of the
spectrum:

  * Work can be a low-drama, evidence-driven, safe, humane, and intellectually honest pursuit, or
  * Work is a struggle against human frailty … a controlled, political train-wreck that we can somehow harness for profits

… and then a bunch of variations across that spectrum. What you find very
quickly is that controlled change is often a battle of mindsets. It becomes a
fight for who will own and take credit for the change. A Kanban board is a
blank slate. It is a simple tool … that can be used to model _anything_. But
it is also a trigger:

> Well, you know we’re overworked. Everyone can see that. We’ve complained
about it, but have been told we just need to deal. What will making it visible
do for us?

> I’d prefer not to put that ops work on the board. Because then it will be
micro-managed, and we will need to explain everything

> David is not pulling his weight. But I don’t want to be the person to call
that out. Plus, management has lost hope in us anyway. They are working around
us with that top-secret project.

> We will never get resources if we make a fuss.

So I’ve been asking myself lately: how can we create environments that are
safe enough to make continuous improvement possible? How can we make a simple
visualization of work less threatening. Thoughts? Please reply in the comments

# Service Machines and SaaS Robots

Step back and think of your product as a swarm of service-delivering robots.
Serve your customer, and not the product.

* * *

### Service Machines and SaaS Robots

#### Step back and think of your product as a swarm of service-delivering
robots. Serve your customer, and not the product.

Some late night rambling…

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZC9N7pVmcJDv85wQ6pS6yg.png)

SaaS companies are service ecosystems. By “service” I am not talking about
_professional_ services (though SaaS companies can certainly offer these). I’m
talking about service as:

> the production of an essentially intangible benefit … which through some
form of exchange, satisfies an identified need
([source](https://www.archives.gov/preservation/products/definitions/products-
services.html))

Imagine a restaurant with robot chefs and waiters. Your code is basically
scripted service design and delivery. You can pay an accountant for tax
“services”. Or you can pay Intuit for tax “services”. Intuit uses code (as
well as humans) to orchestrate the service delivery.

When we “ship a feature” we are adding some sort of service delivery
capability. It is only valuable when it “satisfies an identified need”. The
code itself is like a recipe for robot chefs. If the food sucks, or people
don’t eat the food, the recipe is not valuable. There needs to be an exchange.
Yes people buy on the items on the menu, but they renew on the quality of the
exchange.

Robots? Sure. Consider the increasing use of AI and machine learning in B2B
SaaS products. Often we refer to SaaS products as “tools”. Consider that we
perceive of these products as tools because we (the user) USE the tool. It
feels like a hammer, darkroom, nail gun, or calculator. Fair enough. But we
use these tools to achieve an outcome. What if the outcome was delivered by
our code-drive-robot virtual assistant? The photo is retouched, or math
problem calculated. Hmm … that feels like a service.

The context for our SaaS service delivery machine is constantly evolving. The
actors in the system — prospects, customers, employees, technology touch
points, partners, the broader competitive landscape — are not motionless. They
are all “the product”. Our engineers are the product. HR is the product. The
distinctions between engineering and the product team are imaginary.

As SaaS product managers we don’t ship product like a shoe company ships
shoes. Rather, we oversee the emergence of a service delivery ecosystem. You
can view Apple as a product and/or design company (and they certainly do both
very well). Or you can view them as master service designers providing a
lifetime of touch-point enabled experiences. Apple Care! Apple Store!
Geniuses!

I frequently hear UX designers complain about agile software development. It
causes us to cut corners! When can never “get it right”. I think that these
things are vestiges of shipping wrapped/fixed/tangible products. And if you
view it like that, an agile approach to software development will always feel
shitty. It’s like design-by-a-thousand-cuts or building a grand sand castle
one grain at a time … it feels incomplete and clumsy

But step back and think of your product as a swarm of service-delivering
robots (and your human staff as a team of smart, warm, breathing service
delivery agents), and suddenly the ability to change course, evolve, and adapt
— like a restaurant evolving its menu and service — makes sense.

Consider all customer interactions with your company. Serve the customer, and
not the product.

### Best Practices, Games, and Game Changing

I was pondering various Twitter debates (e.g. #NoEstimates, agile vs. Agile,
the dangers of incremental thinking, Scrum vs. Agile) over the weekend. These
exchanges leave me pretty frustrated, and I was wondering why. I also got most
of the way through [Jeff Gothelf](https://medium.com/u/94a2a063be85) and [Josh
Seiden](https://medium.com/u/7f786c230ca9)’s book [Sense and
Respond](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HLN0QGQ/ref=dp-kindle-
redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) which offered up some new angles.

Here’s the best I can come up with (re: my frustration). These various debates
lack context. At any given point, you should keep the following questions in
mind about your particular situation:

  1. **The Game**. What game are we playing? What are the “rules” (self-imposed, external, etc.) ?
  2. **Disruption**. How can we change the nature/rules of the game?
  3. **Evolution**. How will the game change without our intervention(s)?
  4. **Best Practices**. How do the best players play the game?
  5. **Training**. How can we become better game players? How can we can eventually outperform the best players?

These questions are obviously related. For example, one might use best
practices (#4) to identify the game (#1), and train people to become better at
it (#5). Or even use best practices to shift games (#2), and render other best
practices less effective. Or the iPhone might get released (#3) triggering a
shift in how we think about the game (#1). Etc.

People use expertise, tools, and methodologies to help:

  * **Understand**. Answer these questions
  * **Act**. act/execute based on our answers to these questions
  * **Reflect**. reflect on/reassess our answers to these questions
  * **Improve**. Get better at answering, executing, and reflecting

And this gets super meta … you can think of these points as games.

**Some things that seem to hold true:**

  * Some games change very slowly. Most dominant actors play the game in a similar way**. **Other games are in a state of flux. The rules are loose. Approaches to playing the game vary widely. There are only so many ways you can fulfill government contracts for missile guidance systems (for example)
  * You can be playing many games at once (e.g. broad games like “software development” or “design”, and narrower games like “cloud analytics providers” or “consumer fitness wearables”)
  * Innovation often involves changing games that were previously considered unchangeable, acting on knowledge of a changing game, or pretending to play one game, while really playing a different game
  * Sometimes you win by consistently playing a known game perfectly. Sometimes your key strength is rule changing and game identification. Sometimes you win by learning new games quickly
  * Best practices in a highly constrained game may not be applicable to a less constrained version of the game. Practices can be “first principles” — applicable to a whole class of games — or offer more specific guidance for a narrower game
  * “Transformation” involves understanding the current game, possibly changing the game, predicting external changes to the game, understanding what skills remain applicable in the new game, and adopting new skills where applicable. Transformation is _not _about playing the existing game better (which can be very important, as well)

**What to watch out for…**

  * When you find yourself saying “it can’t work here” … what are you basing that on? Is the game truly different? Are you referring to internal rules or external rules? What are the “best” people doing who play your game?
  * Debating tools and practices without discussing these questions (1–5) is a waste of time
  * High level manifestos and principles are helpful, but it is important not to conflate these with the practice/tools they inspire (e.g. Agile and Scrum). The problems that Scrum solves may not be applicable for the game you are playing
  * Scrum is cited as something for beginners. Yet it doesn’t resemble what more advanced teams are doing. Is that smart? This relates heavily to how the best people are playing the game (#4) and the best way to get them there (#5). If you take a step back, you might be in the business of software product development. Scrum is a small part of that game.
  * We frequently cite compliance and the “existing culture” as a blocker. Why do we start first with the front-line teams (#5) and the generic game of software development (#1) ? It would seem that the first step would be to start playing a different game (#2). But that’s hard because it is a lot harder to get executives to do something different (#5). Devs are easy in comparison
  * Depending on who you ask about NoEstimates, you’ll discover that someone is trying to solve dysfunction and shift the game (#2), the next person feels they have a better way to play a particular game (#4), and most people aren’t clear about the game in question (#1). That’s confusing

There’s nothing groundbreaking (or original) about these questions. I’m sure
game theorists would eat my for lunch. My point is that people should 1)
question their own assumptions, and 2) try to build shared understanding. Most
of the “debates” I participate in are lacking any sort of shared context.
Let’s fix that.


# Learned Helplessness and the Ops Death-Spiral

### Learned Helplessness and the Ops Death-Spiral

Are you in Ops? Do you deal with Ops teams? Does this sound familiar?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DIw5krqGhmHZBTBYHv1F7g.png)

#### The Cycle

  * Business grows. The focus is on growth drivers: new products, new features, and shiny objects. Cost of maintaining the increased complexity is routinely underestimated. Ops drops some balls…
  * In light of above-mentioned dropped balls, the business asks Ops to be “more responsive”. This responsiveness is achieved by taking on more work (high utilization) and taking on different streams of work (multitasking / context switching). There’s a willingness to please. But cracks form, and more balls are dropped…
  * The problem is identified! It’s a management problem! Project management is brought in to act as human load balancers. Capacity is essentially auctioned to the rest of the organization during periodic planning activities. The focus still remains on the “new”, and the cost of maintaining the existing infrastructure/services continues to grow (and to be underestimated…)
  * This eagerness (and newfound accountability and track-ability) is rewarded in the short term. However, things begin to slip behind the scenes. Lead times increase (but are more “predictable”). Quality slowly slips. Work feels more controlled and business-like, but degradation in overall capabilities is constant. Entropy increases. Heroic efforts rewarded…
  * The Ops front-line team members feel the strain. They sense quality slipping. They’ve been viewed as a lame duck for a while now — lesser developers / firefighters — but the willingness to please is still strong (almost a reaction to feeling marginalized). Shadow work becomes the norm, meaning that the maintenance work is made invisible because exposing it would destroy the veneer of control. Complexity increases further, increasing the complexity of maintenance vs. the allure of new projects.
  * From the outside, Ops is viewed as passive and not strategic. A sense of inevitable struggle sets in — both inside Ops, and from the “customers” of the team. Low morale makes it easy to identify the problem as one of lack of engagement, poor management, and shoddy discipline (“why can’t they get estimates right”). Learned helplessness sets in. The business will never understand Ops, it is thankless work, and all they can do is keep the sinking ship afloat.
  * Due to lack of Ops responsiveness, feature development teams continuously “work around” operations … using new greenfield technologies, and managed services, and circumventing controls. This creates a technology soup, further complicating Ops life, but creating temporary traction. Of course, the new providers are “so robust” and “so easy to implement”, which is bad PR for Ops (who have been tasked with the HARD work of un-fucking legacy decisions).
  * And the business grows ….
  * On and on. Until something really explodes, at which points consultants are brought in, and everyone is at the water-cooler saying “I told you so”. The embattled team members who were saying “I told you so” the longest are the first to go. They were both right, and ineffective at being right (which is a hard place to be). The managers are able to spin some “we warned you about this” into roles in the new structure. Until ([a la Larman’s Laws](http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/index.php?title=Larman%27s_Laws_of_Organizational_Behavior)) the “change initiative will be reduced to redefining or overloading the new terminology to mean basically the same as status quo”
  * And the business grows…
  * Repeat, at ever increasing scale…

#### So what can you do about this?

  * Become a broken record about Ops impacting the fundamental economics of the business. Connect Ops to revenue (and speed to discover new revenue sources). Fight being attached to proxy metrics like project completion
  * Get beyond the DevOps hype and understand that [there are many topologies that work (and don’t work)](http://web.devopstopologies.com/). You don’t need to run your whole company in one model. Focus on the why, iterate, and repeat
  * Be forceful about adding headcount to accommodate added complexity. Establish resourcing model that correctly accounts for the increased overhead of managing complexity
  * Visualize the true cost of matrixing your team members. This often involves making _all _the work visible, which is especially hard when team absorbs a ton of invisible work. Use data to demonstrate the impact of the matrix. Lead time and rework can be powerful here
  * Say No! Being customer-centric can be your achilles heel. It is your responsibility to call out efforts that will be, by their very nature, difficult to support with existing resources
  * Speak more about capabilities (vs. IT “projects”). Your job is to zero in on the capabilities required for success, not passing projects through the pipe. Encourage your team to build capabilities with a minimal amount of complexity
  * Hire technical product managers your team TRUSTS (instead of project managers). Once you view your infra/tools as a product, you’ll start taking a longer term strategic view
  * Limit work in progress and utilization rates. Your team wants to “kick ass”, but you have to slow down to speed up. Sure you’ll feel more responsive if you can “commit” to parallel projects, but in the long run it’ll be better to focus on flow and capabilities

That’s it for now. Comments appreciated….

### You Can’t Be All Things…

Beyond the hype and rhetoric, what is your organization optimized for? Every
strength is a potential weakness. Trying to be good at everything is a losing
proposition. So when the chips are down, what are you betting on? What do you
need to be…right now, and in the future. And “everything” is a copy out
answer.

### Why Do We Estimate?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JHB6gTAeQ8jThEuZJL3q6A.png)

I recently asked a group of engineers, product managers, UX, and QA this
question. Here’s how they replied:

We use estimates to/so/because _____________________

  * To force a conversation about each story … especially the complex ones
  * So we can fill up our sprint with a certain number of story points
  * To keep our work sustainable, and not commit to doing too much (in a sprint)
  * So we can tell someone when the project will be done
  * So I can communicate the current status of the project
  * So I can point out how scope creep will impact the delivery date of the project
  * So I know when the team will be ready to pick up a new project, and I can work with the project stakeholders to clarify requirements
  * So we can measure the team’s effectiveness
  * To prevent a shared resource from getting overloaded
  * So we can measure individual contributor effectiveness
  * To aid us in prioritization. We want to find small / valuable features
  * Because that’s what you do in Agile, right?
  * To hold people accountable. With a velocity goal they’ll be more motivated
  * To add them all up, and figure out what is possible or not possible by a certain date
  * To divvy up the costs for individual projects. Time tracking was too difficult so we used the estimated points instead
  * So that we can measure the ROI for particular projects
  * To calculate project risk. It is all about risk vs. reward

How many of those feel like “good fits” for estimation? How many are bad fits?
Might there be other ways to achieve the same end goal(s)?

In reading this list, consider these recurring themes:

  * batch sizes (“large” vs. “small” projects)
  * the Scrum methodology, and fixed iteration lengths
  * External team dependencies and stakeholder needs
  * The role of deadlines in your business model
  * Performance management practices
  * Level of trust and safety
  * Accounting practices
  * How teams are assigned to projects. Team autonomy in terms of selecting/pursuing solutions

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vmGOGEjn2TXlmaIoj0wQNg.png)

Team 1: “When will you be ready for us?” Team 2: “When will YOU be ready?”

Depending on your context, you may be leveraging estimates to address multiple
goals. Many of those goals are context dependent. If you can control certain
variables in your environment, you can narrow the “job” you are hiring
estimation to do. And frankly, some of these things are best served/achieved
through other approaches. In those cases, estimates aren’t the best (or even a
barely acceptable) tool for the job.

Given the list above, I can pick out 5–7 that have nothing to do with
estimates or estimation.

Context matters. Let me pick a context from the last five years of my career
(B2B SaaS):

  * In optimization mode, we were releasing 5–10 improvements weekly (mini projects)
  * We didn’t work in fixed iterations
  * The work culture valued sustainable habits
  * Teams were aligned around moving a particular metric. Many of the “projects” failed (we aborted the experiments early) while we doubled down on other efforts when they moved the needle
  * We had minimal external dependencies
  * Teams were measured in terms of outcomes produced, not code shipped or projects finished

Or course #NoEstimates critics will tell me I don’t live in the real world,
that I’m irresponsible, and that this is not how real business happens. Let me
go hide in my imaginary cave and cower. But wait … we were still estimating.

In my context, estimates had a narrow job. The efforts were small. We didn’t
need to thread the dependency needle. No customers were expecting things by
specific dates. No marketing people needed to be informed months in advance of
a release (a week’s notice was fine). You could calculate costs easily just by
looking at the cost of the team. And the nature of the SaaS model meant that
we were always adding/removing functionality from the product. There was very
rarely a definitive done….as we were _always_ adding/removing. We’d be pretty
safe to answer “10–15d” for anything we were currently working on, and we’d be
pretty close.

So stepping back, the “cost” was fixed, and the ROI was measured by looking at
how the team tracked against improving specific metrics (and some agreed upon
value for moving those metrics). And even still we estimated — albeit
implicitly — when we thought about “small experiments”.

This is a very rare environment (more of a service ecology). It is probably an
“extreme” environment compared to other domains, though it was a publicly
traded company. Big projects, fixed dates, and lots of dependencies are more
common. And many teams cannot connect their work directly to customer outcomes
and get feedback so quickly.

One of the problems with the #NoEstimates movement is that it (very
unintentionally, as expressed by certain practitioners) lacks empathy. It
makes the blanket statement that estimates are bad for ALL uses. Which
translates into them being bad for people trying to operate in their current
circumstances/context. They’re basically saying … “So what if your marketing
team needs to know what will be included in the next release!” Or “So what if
you have a poor shared service that has to auction off its capacity!”
Estimates become the bad guy instead of singling out the truly dysfunctional
things they’re hired to do — e.g. “improve accountability”.

And then there is the class of estimation jobs where the outside context can
be changed (e.g. dependencies removed, work delivered in smaller batches, more
flow, tighter feedback loops, etc.) This doesn’t remove the need for
estimation as a fundamental concept, but it very much changes the estimation
emphasis. Here I think it is best to focus on the levers. “What could we do to
work in smaller batches, and incorporate customer feedback more quickly?” “How
could we do a better job at prioritizing based on cost of delay?” I see this
as a continuous improvement effort.

Finally, In some environments I would argue that these levers (e.g.
dependencies, overutilization) are a far greater problem than the need to
estimate. No amount of estimation will help the company unravel its massive
dependency issues or bloated planning process. Because of this, you can safely
remove the practice until those problems are resolved. It is one less thing
you’ll need to be worried about, and might even help focus the discussion. At
some later point you, when the other issues are resolved, you can worry about
estimates again, and figure out what you’ll hire them to do.

So the tl;dr of all this is:

  * Context, context, context.
  * What job are you hiring estimation to do?
  * Is it the right tool for the job? Is it working? If it isn’t working, why?
  * What levers do you have at your disposal that might impact the “job” of estimation?
  * When does the process add value, and when does it act as dead weight?

Cheers! Comments appreciated.

# Have You Heard That One About SAFe?

And why I’m going to stop telling SAFe jokes (for now)

* * *

### Have You Heard That One About SAFe?

#### And why I’m going to stop telling SAFe jokes (for now)

_(Note: If you don’t know about SAFe, please learn more
_[_here_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Agile_Framework)_. “SAFe
synchronizes alignment, collaboration, and delivery for large numbers of agile
teams.” )_

[SAFe](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/) is an easy target. It’s like
laughing at sunburnt package tourists on the beach, saying
[Velveeta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velveeta) isn’t [artisanal
cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artisan_cheese), ridiculing friends with
Cross-Fit injuries, and grumbling about
[autotune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-Tune) in popular music. SAFe is
the Creed of the Agile echo chamber (it’s trendy to hate Creed. It’s like
Nickleback. You’re _supposed_ to hate them).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sEtIejXkPOW5pMPRvFKoRQ.png)

“How can anyone fall for this bloated, over-processed, and overly-prescriptive
bullshit?” “You’ll never become Agile by doing SAFe!” “[[It] avoid[s] the very
basics of agility and complexity!](http://cognitive-edge.com/blog/safe-the-
infantilism-of-management/)”.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*va62jDIdD2zk2dD20es_iw.png)

Velveeta ad with guys who look like they work at my local coffee shop

I’ve cracked a couple of my own SAFe jokes, and chatted about SAFe with
unwinding speakers at the conference hotel (evangelism requires sustenance).
Here’s a question and challenge — to myself, as well as others. Why do we even
care? Why do we waste our breath? What does this sniping say about us? Some
pondering for the consultants:

  * How good is the service design for your alternative “way” ? Is it accessible? It is actionable? Can it be taught? Outcomes?
  * So what? Is it our job to save _all _companies? Why expend the energy? Ever act of creation is an act of destruction, no?
  * Imagine you were hired as CEO for a large organization (as an alternative to them adopting SAFe). What exactly would you do?
  * So what if the bagel store down the street doesn’t make real bagels. People will discover your store and buy real bagels. Right?

Some introspection. Every minute I spend steaming and sniping is a minute NOT
spent on offering an alternative. There will always be autotune, industrial
farm-to-table, paint-by-numbers, and [David
Hasselhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hasselhoff) albums. And maybe
these things need to exist to enable alternatives. The instinct of any
craftsperson is to freak out when someone butchers the craft — OMG, that is
NOT fucking al dente Pasta! But, then it is back to work.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XW2E3W-TiNnREsCuWddOtw.png)

This may be a stretch, but I also wonder whether the current state of Agile is
unsettling to longtime practitioners, and that SAFe represents the most
convenient scapegoat. It’s easy to blame corporatization, packaging, and
pyramid schemes, but perhaps more difficult to ponder the accessibility and
fracturing of the movement itself. Yep, the Manifesto is still there, so
there’s that… as _perfect_ as ever _of course_. “Uncovering better ways” is
the Try…Catch that lets us claim Agile lineage to anything tried in software
development since 2001 (and earlier, during a 30 year Agile gestation).

But still, _something _feels a bit adrift.

Whenever I read “that’s not Agile” or “you don’t do Agile” or “lowercase vs.
uppercase Agile” or “DevOps IS Agile” … I feel like I’m stuck in that nebulous
end of Part 1 in a three part trilogy … where the merry band is drifting and
bickering, the path forward is obscured, some want to turn back, and some want
to swallow the magic potion. Or arguing over [80s music](https://www.quora.com
/What-decade-is-considered-the-worst-decade-for-music-in-the-
past-70-years/answer/David-Stewart-8?srid=h0Eh) with friends. I really applaud
[Joshua Kerievsky](https://medium.com/u/28229c304ac9) ‘s work on Modern Agile…
for at least trying to move the conversation forward.

Maybe it is the echo chamber?** **There are very few people voicing the
perspective of non-consultant full-timers. The narrative is primarily driven
by consultants and “thought leaders”… all with something to sell, and with
some vested interest in guiding the perception of the market, closing deals,
and getting their foot in the enterprise door. This isn’t bad but it is what
it is. Thoughtful comparisons of approaches would benefit everyone.

(Side note. OH: _“The real money is in the enterprise, doing org-design, and
dealing with scaling. Just do the math. That’s why everyone is jumping on
that.”_)

Here in Hamburg (I spoke at Mind the Product Engage, which was great fun) I
had the pleasure of speaking to someone about their multi-year effort to scale
their organization. It was wonderful, detailed, rich, story-filled, and
informative (and lacking any pretentious jargon). We desperately need more of
these stories.

There’s something weird about the sniping and joking, and I can’t exactly put
my finger on it.

I think for now I’m going to shut up about SAFe, “that’s not Agile”, “you
can’t just copy Spotify”, and “Scrum is childish” (this one will be hard).
There’s more I have to learn here … both about myself, and this crazy domain I
find myself in. I can be more humble and outcome focused.

### Product Development Team Self-Assessment

For my current context (B2B SaaS) I think this is a good self-assessment for
product development teams. I’m sure it somewhat resembles other assessments,
but interestingly it was created by a product development team (I facilitated
the activity and tried to help with word-smithing). They “owned” the approach,
which went a long way towards the team using the tool (they created).

The team committed to take the assessment quarterly as part of their organic
continuous improvement approach. The detailed results were kept private within
the team, and were not used for any kind of performance management scheme, or
management oversight. Changes in the “health score” (the average of the
individual team member scores) served as the catalyst for conversations and
experiments.

It is not appropriate for all environments. You’ll notice it has a bit more of
a “product tilt”, which correctly represents this team, but will not represent
all teams. With their permission I am sharing it here to inspire others to
develop similar self-assessments.

* * *

  * 1 — Strong Disagree
  * 2 — Disagree
  * 3 — Neither agree nor disagree
  * 4 — Agree
  * 5 — Strongly Agree

  1. **Customer Access**. The team has direct access to customers/users/partners/stakeholders and can contact them directly to do research, discovery, testing, and validation. The team knows who they are building for and why
  2. **Measure and Act On Impact**. The team measures the impact of what they deliver to customers, has direct access to that data, and regularly uses that qualitative and quantitative data to guide their product development efforts. Poorly performing “features” are routinely eliminated or improved
  3. **Aligned With Business Outcomes**. The team aligns its work directly to business outcomes (e.g. new revenue, upsell, churn, customer satisfaction, adoption), and not to proxy variables (e.g. time to project completion, velocity, etc.) When business outcomes are potentially counterbalancing (e.g. revenue growth vs. churn), that balance is represented to avoid adverse impacts
  4. **Context and Focus**. The team stays aligned with value streams and initiatives for long enough to develop meaningful familiarity with the problem space and technology options/stack. We are not playing whack-a-mole and project-hopping. We iterate to achieve great outcomes
  5. **Limited External Dependencies**. The team is unhindered by external dependencies. Examples of external dependencies might include: operations/IT, quality assurance, external UX and design dependencies (we prefer these dedicated to the team), sales and marketing, stakeholder approvals, limited meeting space, other feature development teams, etc.
  6. **Tools and Resources**. The team has timely and consistent access to the tools and resources it needs to do its work. If these tools are provided by outside resources, they are done so with minimal friction
  7. **Continuous Improvement**. The team regularly conducts safe retrospectives with a skilled and unbiased facilitator. The team holds itself accountable for continuous improvement experiments, and regularly updates (and self-enforces/adapts) its working agreements.
  8. **Funding**. The team understands their funding model, and avoids delivering complexity/capabilities/value streams that they will have difficulty maintaining and improving due to lack of resources. Team is adequately resourced to deliver on its commitments and initiatives
  9. **Standards**. The team sets and **_self-enforces_** quality, craft, and collaboration standards
  10. **Complexity and Risk Management**. The team monitors the accumulation/emergence of technical “debt”, has an economic model for prioritizing this debt based on current capability gaps, and regularly prioritizes debt “work-down” to limit adverse economic effects (e.g. rapidly lengthening lead times, reliability issues, lost opportunities)
  11. **Flow**. The team measures lead time (from some early point of commitment to actual value delivery), limits work in progress, and avoids high utilization rates. All work is visualized on a physical or virtual board, including “small stuff”, maintenance activities, rework, and fixing defects
  12. **Sustainable**. The team has sufficient time (and space) set aside for focused, thoughtful work without disruptions. Meetings are well run and valuable. The work schedule is sustainable
  13. **Safety**. The team fosters a safe work environment: safe to learn, safe to fail, safe to take risks, safe to have diverse interests, safe to push back and dissent, safe to onboard new team members etc. Environment features a high level of [psychological safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety) (and [this source](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/how-to-foster-psychological-safety/))
  14. **Celebration**. The team celebrates its wins (meaningful wins, not success theater) and learns from its failures. The team is encouraged to experiment to find better solutions, and discover better ways of working given their current context
  15. **Coaching and Facilitation**. Team members have access to coaching (for hard and soft skills), career development guidance, and conflict resolution assistance for challenging interpersonal situations

### Why Do Things Get Worse (With Teams) ?

The goal of this post is to inspire discussion. I pose a question, and I’d
love to hear your thoughts. Links to articles and books are appreciated.

Imagine you get together with a couple good (motivated) friends and embark on
a challenging, temporary mission together. The mission requires expertise,
discipline, collaboration, and continuous improvement. You’ve done something
_somewhat similar_ before. And there are a number of moving parts — many
beyond your control, and some only marginally within your control.

Everyone wants to see this _thing _happen. The team is humble and open minded,
and is open to reflecting on how things are going, and making tweaks when
necessary. Perhaps most importantly for this thought exercise, the team is
“flat” in the sense that no one is responsible for managing other people.

Now, I’d like you to consider some things the team might want to do:

  * Figure out where everyone is spending their time to collectively make sure they’re focusing energy in the right direction
  * Critique each other’s work
  * Change direction when something isn’t working
  * Sit through an extended collaboration session (aka “meeting”)
  * Visualize “small stuff” work that might be getting in the way
  * Do a rough back-of-napkin estimate for some piece of the puzzle
  * Tweak working agreements
  * Call someone out for being a jerk (and then move on)

All seems pretty reasonable for a day’s work in this scenario. Let’s assume
that in the case of your merry band … all of this is “OK”.

Now consider what happens when you do these things with “normal” software
development teams (I’m speaking _very_ stereotypically here, but you get the
idea). Tracking time is micro-management personified. Team members are
cautious about providing feedback. There is writing on the wall that something
is doomed, but politics makes it difficult to disengage. Meetings “suck”.
There’s hidden work, because people don’t want to waste their time surfacing
it, or are scared to. Estimation is a game. Direct interpersonal conflict is
avoided at all costs, and instead gets lodged as complaints to management
during 1:1s. I’m sure you can list more…

**This is the question I’m mulling over today.** What exactly happens to turn #1 into #2? Is it a function of …

  * scale and dependencies?
  * caliber of team members?
  * trust and safety?
  * hierarchal reporting relationships?
  * who is held accountable for making decisions?
  * distance to decision makers?
  * skin in the game?
  * expertise?
  * accumulated gripes and awkward stalemates?
  * the desire for people to keep their full-time jobs?
  * local optimization by middle managers?
  * other?


# 7 Abilities You Must Defend (and Improve)

### 7 Abilities You Must Defend (and Improve)

What is the _right_ way to scale your company? How do you know whether a
process is the _right_ process? Here’s an idea … ask yourself whether the
action you are considering **will improve or harm** your ability to do the
following:

  1. Exploit learning quickly and effectively
  2. Understand causality between actions and responses
  3. Probe environment for new information
  4. Synthesize and draw insights from new information
  5. Preserve existing knowledge
  6. Integrate new information with existing knowledge
  7. Maintain and grow system awareness

These items can apply to how we work, who we hire, what we build, who we
target, how we structure our organization, and how we respond to change (among
other things).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*CfIH6JeVz9axBxjGYdy-8g.png)

“Exploit learning” (#1) refers to the act of converting learning into value.
That value might be external customer value, value to the organization, or
value to the team/individual. Every action is an opportunity to learn, which
is covered under #3.

A friend read a draft of this post, and remarked “you didn’t mention just
plain old execution!” I countered by explaining that #1 can refer to
exploiting existing knowledge (e.g. “we know what we need to know, and just
need to execute”). I also asked how she _knew _that they were in an execute-
only mode, and how she’d _know_ when/if the situation had changed enough to
warrant a new approach (#2, #3, #4, #6, #7)

System awareness (#7) is focused on systems thinking, sensing changes, and
understanding the movement of information and energy inside systems. I see
this is more of a “glue” for the other items, as it is important to understand
that applying energy in one area tends to have an impact in another area
(sometimes violent and unexpected). It also covers classification of the
system (see the [Cynefin
framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework) to understand
simple, complicated, complex, and chaotic systems), and how well we understand
the [fitness landscape](http://complexityacademy.io/fitness-landscapes/) for
our current challenge.

Scaling up a company always involves some risk of loss. We make sacrifices in
the hope that more cumulative energy will pass through the system. But when
some of these capabilities are lacking, it is very easy to overshoot. For
example, we might impose too much structure, dictate too much homogeneity,
encourage too much specialization, or grow too quickly … and then get stuck
trying to claw ourselves out of a hole. Why? We were too slow to sense the
negative impact and/or our sense of the system lead us down the wrong path in
the first place.

What happens when we boost or dampen these abilities? Consider these examples:

**Spotify** (the music service) is frequently cited as an example of how to “scale software development”. I’d argue that Spotify is an example of how a team of empowered agile coaches iterated on the scaling challenge, and helped the company resist numerous premature optimization traps. To copy it you would need to create a system conducive to that kind of reflection and experimentation, and the output might not represent what Spotify ended up doing.

When **psychological safety** is lacking, no one speaks up to smooth over
conflicts within teams, which makes it hard to gauge overall system health.
Failure is stigmatized, making it difficult to probe the environment for new
information. Passionate individuals leave the company, bringing with them
important situational knowledge. Layers of management emerge to smooth over
the lack of trust, thereby making it harder to change course quickly.

**Experience**. A skilled product development team is more effective at exploiting information and avoiding architecting themselves into a corner. Experience in a domain lets you build on existing knowledge. You’ve “been there, done that” so you know where to find the signal in the noise when looking at data. Experience from an old domain applied to a new domain can have the opposite effect: close-mindedness, and resistance to learning new things.

**Measurement Debt and Data Silos. **Lack of data makes experimentation very difficult. Data silos impact system awareness, which encourages local optimization over global optimization. If the data is hard to get at, it makes it difficult to leverage historical knowledge.

**Incremental Delivery and Cross-Functional Teams. **We frequently probe the environment for new information, and can exploit these learnings quickly. Different perspectives drive interesting insights. Fewer handoffs means less signal loss.

* * *

A series of small, intuitive, pragmatic sacrifices can have a massive impact
down the road. Once the structures, incentives, commitments, and dependencies
are in place in a system, it can be very difficult to back out. This isn’t to
say that all rules and structure are _bad — _they may be exactly what you need
to battle a particular challenge (or to defend the seven capabilities) — but
they are risky when too rigid.

Give this a try. Create a checklist based on the seven points at the top of
the post. When you are considering making a change, ask if it will improve or
hurt your ability to sense and respond.


# SaaS and Value Stream Soup

Quick SaaS product lesson …

* * *

### SaaS and Value Stream Soup

Quick SaaS product lesson …

Offering new “stuff” is relatively easy.

The challenge is continuing to improve on those value streams.

When customers enter into a relationship with a SaaS startup, they do so
knowing that things will be rough around the edges at first. The expectation
is continuous improvement and innovation. You could consider it as more of a
service relationship. Customers — especially those open to adopting new, and
relatively untested products — expect you to keep making things better on
their behalf (“your team is always innovating!”)

Customer needs and expectations evolve, competitors arrive on the scene, and
new technologies become available for building and consuming services. To make
matters even tougher, you need “plumbing” that coordinates across these
offerings, and that becomes an ongoing concern unto itself as dependencies and
complexity multiply. So you’re being hit by multiple angles and it is not
easy. This is exactly why startups thrive in dynamic contexts, and why hyper-
optimized-for-one-domain enterprises have trouble shifting gears. The fitness
landscape is constantly changing, providing opportunities for new players who
can sense and exploit the gaps that big players cannot fill.

The temptation early on is to shotgun blast features at different personas,
and value streams. This 1) helps close more deals (“hey, we do that!”), 2)
gives the outward impression of a dynamic, responsive company, and 3) let’s
the startup explore potential pivots. _Everything _is greenfield, and there is
_so much to build!_ This results in a minimally _viable_ product skeleton, but
in no way guarantees that you’ll be able to iterate on the distinct value
streams from an economic standpoint.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Aiutq6x5KxsX0HkLkjY4jQ.png)

Phases of product development team organization

Speed has a cost. A “10x” team is capable of delivering far more initial
functionality and complexity than it can reasonably service on an ongoing
basis. To adequately move the needle across multiple value streams, you’ll
eventually need to hire a multiple of your current headcount (hint: it’s not
linear). And this is the basis of the scaling challenging. The important
question is: what will your business _really_ need to be when/if it grows up?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*efT-TFm_X_wk7SeQTRsC-w.png)

When thinking about value streams I focus on the Who, Why, What, and How (see
[Impact Mapping](https://www.impactmapping.org/)). For example, at a prior gig
we targeted Product Managers, Marketers, Customer Success, and Content
Managers/Writers (so four Whos). We addressed multiple “Whys” for some of
these personas. Once you got down into the How, things really exploded … with
multiple touch-points, “features”, and technologies. What this told me was
that down the road we’d need a _big _team (split into multiple teams) to
actual move the needle across the value streams in question.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Vec7tjwUXrdgFISAOUSbmw.png)

There’s no right or wrong here, except that the temptation to go broad is
strong (especially if you have strong developers and vocal customers). Once
you go broad, you start rationalizing a platform or all-in-one solution
(because its tough to go narrow once you’ve gone broad). Once you go all-in-
one, you have to start thinking big … more capital, bigger team, more value
streams, and a more complex sales environment.

So here’s the tip. Even if you are in a project factory / feature factory
model at the moment, it is important to think about what your startup might
look like in a mission-based model. You’ll need to map out the various value
streams (each combination of Who, Why, What, and How), and then gut check what
your business would look like if you were adequately moving the needle on
those value streams. This is easier than you think. I use my Tweet exercise …

Imagine 3–5 people walking into work each day. They are motivated around a
mission. What is their mission in a Tweet? I’m not talking about a high
minded, pie in the sky mission statement. I’m talking about something a bit
more pedestrian and more actionable. Something like:

  * Improve Help Center search relevance for end-users. Raise ticket deflection rates!
  * Insights for staff accountants. Fewer ad-hoc reports.
  * Helping Customer Success teams doing awesome quarterly business reports. Lower time to prep.
  * Churn detection for our SMB business. Lower churn rates.

You can size these up/down as you see fit, but the general idea is to answer
the question “if someone told me N number of people were supporting that
business goal, would I be surprised?” This will take some tweaking — sometimes
the missions feels a little big, or a little small — but keep iterating until
it feels right.

What you find when you do this exercise is that many startups are trying to
solve WAY TOO MANY value streams. There’s no way they’ll move that many
needles without very considerable scaling up. This is the curse of the MVP
idea (when not viewed as a minimally viable experiment). It is way too easy to
build a product skeleton of something that will be _way bigger _than you
expected.

So … starting thinking less about features, and more about value streams. It
may seem trivial to add another who — oh sure, it seems to work for them TOO!
— but with every Who/Why, you’ll open up a new can of worms. Open that can!


# Why We Write Tickets

### Why We Write Tickets

Shared with my team the other day in Slack …

**Why we write tickets**

  * So if we get sick, a teammate can help us out
  * To help us decompose our work into small pieces
  * As a placeholder for a real-life conversation
  * To keep track of how we resolved the issue
  * To make our standups effective
  * To point out dependencies
  * To reflect on the mix/makeup of our work during retros
  * Self-discipline. Don’t take on too much. Try to do one thing at a time

**Why we DON’T write tickets**

  * To track our time
  * To compete with other team members
  * To show managers we’re busy
  * To make managing people possible
  * To report status, or % complete
  * Because Jira is fun to use
  * External discipline

# Low Effort / High Value? Think Again…

A frequent way to prioritize work is to rank work items by effort and value.
This falls flat for a couple reasons:

* * *

### Low Effort / High Value? Think Again…

A frequent way to prioritize work is to rank work items by effort and value.
This falls flat for a couple reasons:

  * High, medium, low value … does not reflect your confidence level. Some things have a **low** probability of being **big** winners. What’s the value in that case?
  * High, medium, low value … does not reflect urgency/depreciation. The item might be extremely valuable, but it will be equally valuable in a year. Or it will lose value immediately after a particular date (like a new landing page for a Superbowl ad)
  * Some efforts are amenable to incremental value delivery, and others are not. Incremental delivery lets us deliver some % of the value quickly, thereby reducing risk and extracting information to inform future efforts. We’re also free to make partial progress, and stop. What is that worth?
  * In a similar vein, some items have a lot of optionality while others require a leap of faith. What is that flexibility worth? Is that reflected in Value?
  * When prioritizing, it can be tempting to “project-ify” missions so that you can estimate effort. That turns the discussion into “how valuable will it be to ship this feature and how long will it take?” vs. “how valuable will it be to solve this problem and how can we incrementally fund this?” These two questions can yield very different answers (one is bounded by the particular solution)
  * Value is relative to _all _other efforts that share dependencies. If you ask 10 product managers to rank their priorities, you’ll get high priority items from everyone. This is fine if you have ten autonomous teams. But if those teams share a resource — Ops, infrastructure, UX, for example — then you need to compare the items apples-to-apples. When you do that, you’ll get some teams that can work autonomously on low priority items. Which is fine until you realize those low priority items add complexity and overhead.
  * Effort…does not reflect the cost of maintaining added complexity. Building something quickly may introduce technical debt that has longterm, non-linear costs. Or, the cost of supporting the feature may be huge (and we often ignore this effort). You could also consider this as negative value or a liability
  * Effort rarely accounts for muti-tasking costs. What is the effort in the context of _other work_ that will be occurring?
  * What is information worth? When thinking about value, we frequently limit ourselves to cost savings and revenue. But information can be extremely valuable (e.g. revealing customer needs)

I suggest learning more about [cost-of-delay](http://blackswanfarming.com
/cost-of-delay/) for an alternate prioritization approach.


# Doers and Managers

Some Saturday morning coffee rambling.

### Doers and Managers

Some Saturday morning coffee rambling.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OOsLGE6o87ZyhujH5Mb5Rg.png)

What does the front-line doer see? Doers see “the work”.

The code and interface hold the history of shiny objects, hires, fires, and
crunch time. Coherence gaps and manager-pragmatism manifest in “the work”. And
that’s where the doer’s “work” happens … navigating those peaks, and valleys.

What happens when the doers speak up?

_“You have to focus on what you can change and control” … “no one likes the
complainer” … “things could be a lot worse” … “thanks for the feedback, I’ll
get back to you”._

Which all makes sense. Because that is the manager’s world. The manager has a
keen sense of organizational inertia, whirlpools, and grinding tectonic
plates. It’s all about the dollars, cents, influence, and headcount. These
elements are no less “real”, but they still feel abstract and frustrating to
the doer. The doer laments …

_“But you’re making silly sacrifices” … “why not wrap the management stack
with tests, and run it like code?” … “why don’t we judge ideas by their merit
instead of executive-buy in and proxy metrics?”._

Imagine a developer optimizing a program. They find a memory leak or a poorly
implemented pattern. What do they do? Fix it. Deploy it. Now imagine the toxic
relationship between executives that is sinking two departments (but somehow
is at a stalemate), or the fall-out from the recent acquisition, or the steep
price paid for rapid growth. These things assault the doer’s senses. If you
were to draw these things in an architectural diagram, or view them in the
output of a memory profiler, you’d silence a tech review audience in an
instant.

The doer-developer is “dinged” immediately for errors, bugs, and slipped
projects, while an organization can go years/decades without purging itself of
systemic issues. To doers that seems _massively_ unfair. To managers, that is
to be expected, and equates to focusing on what you can control. “Stay
practical and deal with today’s problems” they say. Doers see bad and
irrational behavior “all the time” on the part of managers and leadership (the
cat-herders), while managers see reticence, stubbornness, and laziness (the
cats). And both are right, somehow.

One thing I know for sure … the doers experience cognitive dissonance and poor
coherence at the source: “the work”.

Assuming the job market is good, both the manager and the doer have some
agency when it comes to deciding whether they should stay. Which means, of
course, that those remaining in the system are either 1) choosing to remain in
the system because it benefits them, 2) are locked in the system, 3) are
hoping that things will somehow change over time (the long game), or 4)
waiting for their stocks to vest. When you join and organization, it is
extremely important to keep that in mind. Things are the way they are for MANY
reasons.

At the intersection of craft and commerce you will always see these eddies and
whirlpools. Knowledge/craft workers are problem solvers, systems thinkers,
game theorists, and explorers. Asking “why” and “what if” are in our blood.
We’re stubborn and defiant by design (cats?). Now task a manager with being a
teacher, a coach, a sounding board, a whip-cracker, a context builder, a
facilitator, [on and on]. Sandwich them into the white-space of the
organization. Not easy, huh? Easy to fail, right?

If you peel back a lot of the debates about software product development,
you’ll end up at this tension. How much autonomy is given to the doers? Is the
role of management to serve the doers, or serve “the business” ? What is the
role of craft ? Who — managers or doers — are dispensable ? What is oversight?
What happens when managers behave badly? Who decides if something is “good
enough”? What does “moving up” mean, if you are a doer? Are we optimized for
the middle-manager status quo, or for outcomes?

To the cat-herders, cats, inmates, guards, coaches, players, crafters, and
merchants … happy Saturday morning coffee.

# Vacation: Product, Project, or Portfolio?

Is a vacation a product, a project, or a (product/project) portfolio? Let’s
ponder…

* * *

### Vacation: Product, Project, or Portfolio?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*CYRBz1rAzOH73CnapfrG1w.jpeg)

The sun cleared in Dublin. So I took the train down the coast and went for a
hike.

Is a vacation a **product, **a **project, **or a **(product/project)
portfolio? **Let’s ponder…

  * **Varied:** Vacations can be cheap, expensive, short, long, open ended, risky, chill, structured, loose, adventurous, etc.
  * **Value:** Vacations deliver value in different ways. Sometimes you have to wait until the end of the adventure to get the big payoff. Perhaps you measure hours on the beach, time with friends/family, number of “next level, epic” Facebook images shared, or items checked off the bucket list.
  * **Optionality:** You can find deals by booking early. And you can find deals by booking late. Purchasing early buys certainty. Purchasing late or at the register, buys you options. You can buy all-inclusive package tours, self-guided itineraries, or just mix-match-wing-it.
  * **Expensive Options:** It is possible to pay too much money to keep your options open, and also pay too much money for complete certainty (which is sort of the same thing). If we bring a ton of gear we can do “anything we want”. But traveling with a lot of luggage costs money, storing gear costs money, and traveling light gives us flexibility. Same goes with paying crazy rates for a last minute hotel in a major city during the annual herding of the goats (though maybe your wins justify this loss)
  * **Cheaper Options:** There are “cheap” ways to keep your options open … like convertible pants/shorts, buying flex-tickets and rails passes, a good travel abroad data plan, making multiple restaurant reservations, and not pre-purchasing tickets when you can walk onto the bus. Rental cars are a tough call. They provide mobility, but also keep us from drinking too much wine over dinner. Insider knowledge — privileged knowledge — can give you an edge in terms of optionality

Little did we know … we had to drive DOWN a different road

  * **Budgeting:** How do you budget for your vacation? Is there a cap? Have you budgeted so that you can take advantage of serendipitous situations? Do you do a per-day food and adventure budget, or just unfreeze the credit card and live it up?
  * **Planning:** Some people know _exactly_ where they will go every day. Other people plan around food and drink, and leave the rest up to hangovers and the weather. My friend Andy plans “a full one week on a beach not having to think about anything” and then “plays it by ear depending on how relaxed I feel”. My friend Sith “reads Lonely Planet front to back on the plan and highlights the cool things” because he is “incredibly busy”, and doesn’t like to “stress with the planning”.
  * **Information:** How do you plan: books, travelogues, novels, TV shows, YouTube, the advice of friends, Tourist Kiosks … or not at all (you bought the package OR completely wing it) ? How much information do you gather based on your experiences “on the day”, or from people you meet along the way?
  * **Time:** Most of us need to travel between fixed dates and fixed locations. But what about an open-ended vacation? I remember traveling to Buenos Aires and hanging out until it “got old”. Then I traveled down to Patagonia and (because I brought some gear) trekked for a week +/- a couple days.
  * **Skills:** How are your travel skills? Some people I know always seem to end up stumbling into the best situations. Other people are map-challenged, and end up eating the fake local food. Can you sleep on a plane? Are you comfortable with the discomfort of not knowing the language? How about train/bus travel in foreign countries … is that your thing?
  * **Dependencies:** What about constraints and dependencies? Are you a vegetarian, scared of water, afraid of heights, or committed to visiting an old friend for a day before you fly out? Do you need a visa? Did you need shots? If we travel with friends we gain some things — it’s safer, we can share the driving, and we can divide and conquer when it comes to planning — in exchange for some downsides (hard to please everyone, coordination challenges, etc.)
  * **External Funding:** How does your attitude change if somebody else is funding the vacation? For example, my friends did a bucket-list wedding registry. They were so absolutely grateful, but it also meant that they were forced to do everything on their bucket list while traveling through Australia and New Zealand. It “got tiring”, but they felt indebted to get the Instagram shots (yay, bungee jumping). Or maybe, after spring break, you had to answer to your parents about why there were liquor store charges on your jointly held credit-card and a room cleaning charge. How irresponsible of you!

So what is it? Product, project, product portfolio, or project portfolio?


# Hard Systems, Soft Systems, and “It Depends”

A random walk through the SEBoK glossary…

* * *

### Hard Systems, Soft Systems, and “It Depends”

#### A random walk through the SEBoK glossary…

Have you checked out the [Guide to the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge
(SEBoK)](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Guide_to_the_Systems_Engineering_Body_of_Knowledge_%28SEBoK%29)?
I suggest you do. In this post, I am going to take a semi-random walk through
the SEBoK glossary. Why? It’s an awesome resource, especially when you find
yourself pondering the principles underpinning how we grapple with software
development.

_Note: I’ve likely butchered a bunch of SE concepts. Oh well! Gotta start
somewhere._

What system do we have in mind?

Are we thinking about a [hard
system](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Hard_System_%28glossary%29) that can be
“solved” solely with engineering methods, or a [soft
system](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Soft_System_%28glossary%29) “which
require[s] learning in order to make improvements”? Most of us are operating
in [sociotechnical
systems](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_System_%28glossary%29)
featuring “a combination of technical and human or natural elements”. In
[service systems](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Service_System_%28glossary%29), we
maintain a “dynamic configuration of resources (people, technology,
[organizations](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Organization_%28glossary%29) and
shared information)”. The question is… how quickly must we re-configure
([adapt](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Adaptability_%28glossary%29)) those
resources for our specific [system
context](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/System_Context_%28glossary%29)? A
commercial service enterprise such as a bank..

> …sells a variety of products as services to their customers; for example,
this includes current accounts, savings accounts, loans, and investment
management. These services add value and are incorporated into customer
systems of individuals or enterprises. The service enterprise’s support system
**will also likely evolve opportunistically, as new infrastructure
capabilities or demand patterns emerge**.
([link](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Life_Cycle_Models))

To what degree is the system exhibiting [emergent
behavior](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Emergent_Behavior_%28glossary%29) that
_could not_ be predicted beforehand? For example, customers might
[use](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Use_Case_%28glossary%29) our product in
unexpected ways or partners might form unexpected alliances and create new
ecosystems. The [history of AirBnb](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-airbnb-
was-founded-a-visual-history-2016-2) is filled with unexpected twists. If we
expect no new behaviors to emerge, we can take a different approach to
hardening the solution. Constructing a skyscraper might exhibit less emergent
behavior than offering a new cloud computing service. Building a bridge might
be “easier” than trying to design a new compensation structure in a
[coercive](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Coercive_%28glossary%29)
[culture](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Culture_%28glossary%29), or starting a
crowd-sourced dog walking service. Weird right?

One of the challenges of
[project](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Project_%28glossary%29)-centric thinking
is that it frequently hinges on a “defined start and finish criteria”. The
assumption is that [scope](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Scope_%28glossary%29) is
pinned to a set of known capabilities, fitness can be
[verified](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Verification_%28glossary%29) upon
delivery, and that the [design
life](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Design_Life_%28glossary%29) has a known
duration. “A [viable](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Viable_%28glossary%29) system
is any system organised in such a way as to meet the demands of surviving in
the changing environment”, so the question really boils down to the
[environment](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Environment_%28glossary%29) and how
quickly it is changing. If we cannot forecast the demands of the changing
environment ahead of time, then we must take a more [evolutionary
approach](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Evolutionary_%28glossary%29). If
forecasting is feasible, then we can take a more linear/sequential approach.
Your environment will dictate how projects are
[competently](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Competency_%28glossary%29)
[governed](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Governance_%28glossary%29), scoped,
managed, and executed.

The debate over #NoEstimates and #NoProjects tends to ignore context like:

> type of systems involved, their longevity, and the need for rapid adaptation
to unforeseen changes, whether in competition, technology, leadership, or
mission priorities ([link](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Life_Cycle_Models)).

A commercial service enterprise is not playing the same game as a defense
contractor. Chips are played in both games, but played in different ways.
“Estimates” and “Projects” are not the actual problem. My guess is that the
real problem is not correctly sensing the environment, and therefore selecting
the wrong [life-cycle model](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Life_Cycle_Models). Or
there’s low [safety](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Safety_%28glossary%29), poor
[drift correction](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Drift_Correction_%28glossary%29),
[entropy](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Entropy_%28glossary%29), and absent
[critical systems
thinking](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Critical_Systems_Thinking_%28glossary%29).
If the argument is that “practice X isn’t working”, why was the organization
unable to see that or sense that?

In my current [domain](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Domain_%28glossary%29) (B2B
software-as-a-service help desk), customers pay rent to access our hosted
product. The customer does not hand over their hard-earned cash in one go,
grab the pair of shoes, and leave the store. 100,000 customers (and millions
of _their _customers) access the same product suite. There is an expectation
that we will continuously improve service delivery, and for the most part keep
prices stable. [Iterating](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Iteration_%28glossary%29)
on and optimizing existing capabilities is the norm. Often, the fastest way to
learn is to deliver small
[increments](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Increment_%28glossary%29) to our
customers and conduct [in-process validation](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/In-
Process_Validation_%28glossary%29) and [acceptance
sampling](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Acceptance_Sampling_%28glossary%29). But
my domain is one of many. It is altogether different than a 1:1 SAP
implementation, for example.

It is very hard to claim “% complete”.

One challenge with project planning and funding, is that it has the tendency
to encourage premature convergence on a
[design](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Design_%28glossary%29), a fixed set of
[requirements](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Requirement_%28glossary%29), and an
end-date. The customer — internal or external — wants to know what they’re
“going to get” and “by when”. A better question is “what capabilities will be
possible, and on what schedule”.
[Capabilities](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Capability_%28glossary%29) are the
antithesis to premature solutioning. They represent…

  * “current and future needs independent of current solution technology”
  * “outcomes a user needs to achieve which connect the systems feature to the business or enterprise benefit”
  * “describe current and future needs independent of current solution technology”

In SaaS we may do a first pass design to 1) learn more about user needs, and
2) deliver an early “scaffolding” for a capability. Achieving the outcome is
possible, but there are a lot of bells and whistles missing. Then we add more
features, and enrich the design. And often, months or years later, we go back
and change the delivery mechanism altogether. A great example is our use of
machine learning to proactively answer support tickets (the capability) for
some benefit (cost savings, increased customer satisfaction). For my current
company, this is an [ongoing
mission](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Mission_%28glossary%29). And it is possible
because we can deliver, at scale, to all customers, whenever we want.

Finally we have attributes like
[agility](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Agility_%28glossary%29),
[adaptability](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Adaptability_%28glossary%29),
[resilience](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Resilience_%28glossary%29),
[robustness](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Robustness_%28glossary%29), and
[reliability](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Reliability_%28glossary%29). The
business world is littered with companies that were purpose built for one
environment, and then things changed
([disrupted](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Disruption_%28glossary%29) and
[threatened](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Threat_%28glossary%29)). But that
doesn’t mean that all enterprises need the same brand of agility,
adaptability, reliability, etc. Reliability means something different to
Google, than it does to an oil rig. In his notes about Google SREs, [Dan Luu
writes](https://danluu.com/google-sre-book/):

> Goal of SRE team isn’t “zero outages” — SRE and product devs are incentive
aligned to spend the error budget to get maximum feature velocity. if a user
is on a smartphone with 99% reliability, they can’t tell the difference
between 99.99% and 99.999% reliability

So with that I close. It is all about the nature of the environment, and our
ability to make some sense of, and thrive, in that environment.

### 21 Questions for Your PM Role Interviewer

#### After a couple heavy posts, I get practical…

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*H7hiyHUsilS8NVcD1beRRw.png)

Interviewing for a PM (product management) job? Anxious for the “do you have
any questions” part of the interview? My advice…stick to the things that will
have a big impact on your day-to-day work. Some ideas:

  1. Will I have direct access to users and customers? Can I arrange my own calls and meetings? How much time will I spend weekly interacting with customers/users?
  2. Is the team dependent on any other team(s) to ship product?
  3. Is there a UX person dedicated to the team? If so, what are the expectations around that relationship?
  4. Can you describe the various customer value streams, user personas, and touch-points addressed by the team’s work? Does this remain constant? Would you regard the team’s focus as “broad’ or “deep”? Can I view the current backlog?
  5. Describe the engineering culture. Can you share any engineering team blog posts or conference talks? What are the internal tech talks (if any) about?
  6. What is the team’s approach to quality and reliability? How often do you have issues in production? What happens when issues are discovered/reported? Do you “test” by shipping and waiting for customers to complain?
  7. Does the team practice test driven development? Do they regularly refactor the codebase? Who is the chief architect ? Does the team have access to this person?
  8. Describe the team’s deployment pipeline.
  9. Is there an Agile Coach assigned to the team? Scrum Master? Facilitator?
  10. Do you use feature flags / feature toggles? How would the team go about testing new features in production with a small % of customers?
  11. Describe the people I might be meeting with on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. What % of my week will be spent on meeting with internal stakeholders vs. customers?
  12. Who decides what ends up on the team’s roadmap? Describe the decision hierarchy, approvals (if any), governance, and reporting requirements (e.g. % complete, or % to outcome goal).
  13. Does my team conduct regular retrospectives right now? What is the general attitude towards retrospectives? How does the team celebrate?
  14. Is the team assigned to any service / troubleshooting related queues? How much of their weekly time is occupied with those activities?
  15. How will my performance be measured? How will the team’s performance be measured?
  16. How frequently do company priorities change? What was the last big shift?
  17. Describe some recent outcomes delivered by the team (not the features, the outcomes). Can you connect the team’s work to the company’s bottom line? What was the backstory for those initiatives (from idea through execution)? How regularly does the team deliver validated outcomes to customers?
  18. Describe the tools you use for insights and analytics. Will I have access to those tools? Are they regularly maintained? What is currently missing in terms of customer / product insights?
  19. What is the biggest dud shipped recently? What did you learn from that? Have you killed any poorly performing features recently?
  20. What is the most surprising thing I’ll discover in the first couple weeks of working here?
  21. How does the product team (your fellow product managers) approach training and career development? What is the career development budget per product manager?

### To be a team

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*XVJg3i1j5fhPDx961bbsvQ.jpeg)

Product development teams are a fun bunch. When it clicks and there’s flow
across the team….that is super special. I always love going back to old team
working agreements, team values, and team principles. Sometimes they don’t
stand the test of time. And sometimes they still ring clear!

Old team “reminders”. I really like these (even in retrospect):

* * *

#### Team Reminders

_Note: This is a living document. Nothing is set in stone_

  * It’s OK to get angry and say stupid shit. Don’t be a permanent asshole
  * Think about what you actually want (and why you want it)
  * We all have something to teach. We all have something to learn
  * Try not to leave work angry. Work it out if you can
  * Cutting corners is almost never worth it. Don’t leave booby traps
  * Outcomes over output. Impact over quantity and speed.
  * If we were all replicas of each other, work would be really boring
  * Take care of yourself! Eat well. Stay home when you’re sick. Pace yourself
  * Whenever possible, show don’t tell. Specificity beats platitudes
  * Respect each other’s time, and respect each other’s energy
  * Sometimes we all get together and work in the same room (referred to as “meetings”)
  * If we’re not proud of our work, something is wrong. Speak up!
  * Discipline, responsibility, and accountability are part of the craft. Make sure these words don’t get abused and polluted
  * Before thinking “more process” check for trust
  * Laugh and have fun. We’re making stuff! How cool is that?

# Great Burgers

I open a burger joint. Here is my sign:

### Great Burgers

I open a burger joint. Here is my sign:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rLIYm9OYcDWFQh_Wlwwpyw.png)

Everyone _loves_ burgers, right? But the crowds aren’t materializing. After
talking to some close friends, I know why… BEER.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SdccdLeEJHyWpgq-TawT-Q.png)

Does “normal” beer cut it anymore? My friends are beer snobs, but so is
everyone else these days. Hmmm. We need some unique beers. It’s expensive to
set up the tap system but every bar needs a tap system eventually right? I
find a distributor I can trust.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*CWtMDdD_45dOiA_tOlBO0A.png)

The microbrews flow and my friends start inviting their friends. My friend is
having an office party. Office parties! That’s good! Add it to the sign.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0EzjcIH0P33VDunEzko8uA.png)

A couple nights go by with no customers. And I find out why! At first you
think it might be the food. Maybe the burgers aren’t that great. That can’t be
…. sports. That’s worth five TVs for sure…

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Z26qpvx8rwXR9qn6z5VWTQ.png)

Things are going well. I run a burger joint with good beer. And Sports! One
thing bugs me… there’s a patio for rent adjacent to the bar. It’ll be a
stretch to expand, but in the spring and summer that could be a big draw. I
pony up the cash for the rent, licensing, and frequent pigeon poop cleaning
(unexpected):

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GI0fZCMwIve-tOomY6tzPw.png)

Trivia. Super easy way to bring in a crowd on a Wednesday…

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ltzcB4kX1BTjlx0Yvhut3g.png)

Pool. I’m skeptical at first, but my buddy will rent us the tables.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*R9EEpoadS-5V9NixPZ_jFw.png)

Something weird starts to happen. The quality of the food starts to drop. I’m
not sure why. I’ve been getting more complaints lately. We need a real manager
to cover prime shifts. Someone has to do the cat herding. A couple staff
members leave when the new manager arrives. But that’s natural…

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nC7BbqbAJzDeukLBEb25MQ.png)

We’re running a big operation now. The food quality rebounds a bit. But I’m
getting complaints about the pricing. “Why should I pay $14 for a burger to
sit at a noisy sport’s bar!” We need some discounts…

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_3BnMYfwAhv71f3sH7LfoA.png)

More discounts via a bar menu…

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5J2yoZrEqYEsytGxvvuCoA.png)

And then I turn around and realize that I have a sports bar. There’s nothing
all that special about my sports bar. The location is decent, but not great.
It makes some money, but there are cashflow issues (damn patio). A
consultant/investor tells me that I can leverage the brand name at another,
better location (which his connection is selling). I coral the investors and
give it a go:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*06A-hjXh_5PpUCDAZJJqrQ.png)

And then realize I’m in a commodity business. Bail. Have to answer questions
about how I could hire 50 people and not make any money. So I open a food
truck:

### To the Drifters, Makers, Why-Askers, and Systems Thinkers…

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gp_OZtn_lsmZvVb3bRggzQ.png)

I’m looking for my _extended tribe_. I know you’re out there! I want to
connect ( [@johncutlefish](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish) on Twitter).
There’s not a lot of career advice out there for us, and I really wish that
could change. I think we have a ton to offer.

What’s the name of our tribe? Drifting Systems Thinkers? “Creatives” ? Jack-
of-all-trades (masters of _some_)? White-space Dwellers? Org Designers?
Builders, crafters, tinkerers? Why-askers?

We haven’t taken the traditional path in tech (if there is such a thing).
We’ve drifted, explored, tested, failed, and very occasionally “won”. We are
“technical” AND “creative” (and empathetic/stubborn, strategic/tactical,
makers/sellers, problem definers/solution pitchers etc.). Getting work isn’t
difficult, but finding the right fit (for us, not them) is difficult. We lack
the hardened political savvy of managers, but think in systems and have
empathy and perspective. Disorder, uncertainty, and fluidity is comfortable
(hey, we’re drifters), but hindered sense-making _is not_ comfortable (we are
natural sense-makers and systems thinkers).

I’m not saying this is “special”. Rather I’m pointing out that it can be hard
to put us in a neat and tidy box. Those who pick the management track have
certain goals. Those who stay deep in the trenches have certain goals. But
we’re sort of stuck somewhere in the middle.

If you’re like me you relish that amazing rush when a team of creative people
get flow and have impact. But I also see (and feel, deeply) the impact of the
larger picture on the team. I can’t ignore the big picture. Unnecessary
hierarchy bothers me. Intimidation bothers me. Perverse incentives bother me.
Lack of transparency and coherence bothers me. Safety and diversity _is
extremely important to me_. But that’s just me — I just sense this stuff. It’s
me, not you.

It is precisely this “white-space” that can be hard for others to navigate.
And this _is_ where we thrive and where we can provide value. But we need to
support each other with opportunities, feedback, and learning opportunities.
We’re a diverse lot! Let’s capitalize on the bundle of contradictions!

Does this ring true with anyone? How do you balance your interests? Which
environments do you thrive in? How do you find your fit?

### Safety In Silos

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*r8FAvV8Iz16s9gg2uXplmQ.png)

Insert picture of silos here ….

What you if you “rewarded” cross-functional product development teams when
they delivered validated outcomes for customers (vs. rewarding them for
feature velocity)?

Oh there are a lot of reasons not to….

  * Oh goodness, how can you measure that?
  * By the time we can measure that, the team will have moved on to something else!
  * Who will be responsible for measuring? Will they game the numbers?
  * We do our part… focusing on velocity and quality!
  * That’s not the current criteria we use for someone to move up from junior to senior in engineering.
  * All of that is validated before we even start coding.
  * People in our team report to three different departments. How would that work?
  * What if engineering moves too slowly? Who takes responsibility?
  * But there’s so much technical debt. We’ve got our hands tied. I’m not sure we can create outcomes. Just shipping is hard.
  * It is really about the optics. Our investors are looking at our output!
  * We are just trying to add bullet points to the feature list. That is what will make us competitive.
  * By the time the work reaches us, it is already pretty prescriptive. We control the technical solution (the “how”), but don’t really have a say in the “what”.
  * The outcome is already decided! The customer agreed to buy if we built this. So our only job is to build it quickly.
  * The comp structure is already fucked as it is. Do you mean bonuses?
  * Oh then we’d take on all kinds of technical debt because the incentives would be out of whack.
  * I can see product being measured like this. But why engineers?

When you read these answers, do any themes stand out? And did you assume that
by “rewarded” I meant a financial reward vs. what the org celebrates and tells
stories about?

The reality is that the biggest force keeping us locked into the [feature
factory](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-
44a5b938d6a2) is structure and local optimization. It is hard… not because the
tools and practices are particularly hard, but because we structure our
organizations around trust proxies, hand-offs, and mini-kingdoms.

Engineering is asked to be “responsive” and to “build it right”. Which then
pushes the burden to UX and Product to define the “it” beforehand. Which then
incentivizes _them _to stake their incentives on “predictability” and
“shipping the roadmap”. “Do your part”… and everything will be OK.

So. When decrying the [feature factory](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-
working-in-a-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2), make sure you look deeply at how
your own department might be structured. What are the incentives? In my
experience, the front-liners care about impact and outcomes. But something
along the way divides up that sense of responsibility.

### 40 Ways to Invest in More Resilient Teams

You can’t build muscle without breaking down muscle and recovering. You can’t
build resilience and strength without some discomfort and repair. You can’t
learn if you are always focused on efficiency (and if you aren’t open to
feeling a bit dumb sometimes). You can’t expect teams to show “initiative and
autonomy” if you smother them in helicopter management and process.

There are no silver bullets. When people harp on about “10x teams” they very
rarely consider the _cost_ of creating that environment and fostering the
[psychological safety](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-
google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=0) required
for risk taking. It is an **investment and commitment**, and not something you
can simply install (despite what consultants will sell you).

Short-term growth will always be more alluring. But a sound economic framework
will always respect/understand the cost of that growth. Again … it is an
investment. Stress the system too hard with growth (vs. investing in
“positive” stressors to build resilience) and the system collapses.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oUg8EcVu4LsIrtaqVo3yjA.png)

  1. Rotate who “runs” standup
  2. Explore new retrospective formats
  3. Extended new hire onboarding. All new hires work the support queue, sit with sales, and listen in on customer success calls
  4. Run developer exchange programs with other teams
  5. Monitors with real-time customer feedback from support/feedback channels
  6. Anything that involves a team stepping away from their normal setting (an activity, trip, exercise, etc.)
  7. Voluntary facilitation and conflict resolution training. [Non-violent communication](https://www.cnvc.org/)
  8. Enforce a “Zero known defects in production” policy. All work stops, across all teams, if there is a bug in production
  9. Kill-A-Feature days
  10. Limit work in progress in situations where there are cross-team dependencies. Don’t “work around” other teams. Swarm to fix. Limit work in progress in general
  11. Step away from digital tools for worfklow. Use a wall, cards, and tape when you are figuring out better ways of working
  12. Figure out a way to have all team members use the product to do actual work! Or at a minimum be onsite with a customer and observe them for a _couple hours_ working naturally
  13. Shorten iteration lengths. Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment
  14. Feature toggles to test features with new customers
  15. Work through bottlenecks and not around them. Even if it means slowing down in the short term
  16. Standing “bounties” for product development teams. For example, any team, at any time, is free to deliver something that moves Metric X without moving Metric Y
  17. Large-scale “Map the Debt” activities. Visualize current capability gaps
  18. Conduct [premortems](https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem)
  19. Have all team members present when collaborating across teams (instead of just team managers or project managers … see [Unproject Culture](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwiv06rYp__TAhVJwWMKHVKzBuEQFggnMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.crisp.se%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F03%2Funproject.pdf&usg=AFQjCNE5gsI2maM8S9gEWaiPRUcDEXmapw&sig2=eiC_Fo3UN5Ww4ndRwHMCEQ))

### 175 Posts On Product Development! Thanks!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*a6olV-DzYZBLL03qwcuUyw.png)

Obligatory image … so that Medium recommends the post.

I hit a goal of sorts today: 175 posts on product development. Actually… the
goal was 150, but I was having so much fun I forgot about the challenge to
myself in my notebook.

A big thanks to the folks who check out the posts. Your comments,
recommendations, and reads have kept me motivated. Over the last 18 months of
writing, I have learned a ton about myself. Some recent posts — [The Product
Of You](https://medium.com/p/the-product-of-you-d672fb22eb6e), and [To the
Drifters, Makers, Why-Askers, and Systems Thinkers…](https://hackernoon.com
/to-the-drifters-makers-why-askers-and-systems-thinkers-d6bf4991dd9) — have
represented shifts for me personally. I have come to accept more about who I
am, where I thrive, and how I’d like to create impact. And that is due in no
small part to the awesome product development community here on Medium, and on
Twitter (@johncutlefish). Thanks again!

#### Questions?

specific posts, or blogging? I’ll dedicate the next couple posts (or possibly
video) to questions. Please [fill out this form with your

# The Product Of You

Applying product thinking to your work and personal mission

* * *

### The Product Of You

#### Applying product thinking to your work and personal mission

Do you think of yourself as a product? Lately, I have been experimenting with
thinking of myself as a product, and it has been a rewarding experience. I’ll
be the guinea pig here, but I’d love to hear more about the product of You!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6rCyl-0XnGtCiBo6M6Pskg.png)

#### What &amp; Who

What are the outcomes and capabilities I’d like to continuously deliver as
product John Cutler? At the high level, I want to **1)** inspire more
rewarding work experiences for individual contributors, **2)** create better
products and services, and **3)** generate positive, long-term economic
outcomes for organizations and their customers.

#### The How Overlap

There are many “hows” available to drive those outcomes. I’m never going to be
an organizational psychologist or a technical coach (unless I have a big win
and can go back to school). But the circles in the venn diagram _do overlap_
around understanding team dynamics, relating to individual contributors,
outcome-driven product development, UX research, and systems thinking. So that
is where I have decided to do my work.

#### Operating How Assumptions

Over the years I’ve built up some convictions based on my albeit biased work
experiences, reading, researching, and talking to thinkers in the space. I’m
operating on the assumption that the outcomes below will drive the higher-
level outcomes above. It’s important to challenge those assumptions and keep
looking at the data ([as Google did with their Project
Aristotle](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-
from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=0)).

So when it comes to the How/What (in my current role, with my
writing/speaking, and all future roles), I am striving to move the following
needles:

  * Increase [psychological safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety) across organizations
  * Increase team member time spent in flow ([“in the zone”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29))
  * Increase trust in frontline teams to deliver outcomes (vs. manage by proxy metrics)
  * Increase ability for front-line teams to connect their work to core business metrics
  * Increase sense-making abilities, and ability to fully understand changing fitness landscapes
  * Decrease cognitive dissonance, feeling “stuck”, and weak coherence issues
  * Decrease complexity added to products relative to value delivered to customers
  * Increase agency and autonomy among front-line individual contributors
  * Decrease process complexity that does not directly contribute to customer outcomes
  * Increase [awareness of neuro-diversity](https://hbr.org/2017/05/neurodiversity-as-a-competitive-advantage) on teams, and ability to leverage that diversity
  * Increase organizational resilience and ability to adapt to/benefit from uncertainty
  * Decrease impact of local optimization on global system health and outcomes

#### Why

The Why is that I see so many crappy products out there (and wasted effort),
and I see so many builders and designers working on the front-lines feeling
disconnected from the impact of their work. I also see so many companies
falling into the trap of over-fitting for short-term economic gains vs. long
term economic outcomes. They may limp along, but in the process they become
crappy places to work. And I believe there are better ways to approach this.
That’s where my passion is.

So that’s the product of John…warts and weirdness and all. How about the
product of You?!

For the next post … the UX of the product of You!


# Crack The WIP (Work In Progress)

Limiting WIP (work in progress) is hard.

* * *

### Crack The WIP (Work In Progress)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cchtubTtswzR-GrOhc1VBw.png)

Limiting WIP (work in progress) is hard.

It makes _so much_ sense. But it is still hard.

It’s hard because we’re terrified when we don’t look busy.

It’s hard because no one wants to look like a slacker. Adults should be able
to “juggle priorities”. When one thing stalls, we’re taught to “do what we
can”. Roadblocks call for pragmatic and dexterous detours. “Idle hands are the
devil’s workshop” (Proverbs 16:17). The CEO mumbles “you’re kidding me … you
are saying we can’t scratch our heads and skip at the same time!”

> We take on a lot of work because stuff gets blocked by other teams.

Oh interesting, maybe you should help them out?

> Management asked how much work we could take on. I didn’t really know… but
who wants to be a buzzkill? So we loaded up.

Why did management need to know that upfront?

> You’re not seeing half the work. But if put the work in Jira, then someone
will tell us it isn’t a priority. So we do it all … half off the books.

Why wouldn’t they trust you that it is important?

> The sprint was going great until we got thrown off by that issue in
production. And then everything just went to shit. Totally unlucky.

Was it? Why didn’t the team have more slack to deal with it?

> Why don’t we have Jackson do some of those lower priority, but small items
while we wait?

What is stopping Jackson from doing a high priority item?

> I’m worried that if we aren’t proactive…that another team will get the
project!

Why? Are projects assigned on how busy you appear?

The reality is that low-drama “flow” doesn’t look like progress to most
people. There aren’t the burnouts and the tantrums. Supporting casts have less
to do, less to coordinate, and less to “unblock”. You run the _terrible _risk
of having someone idle for a bit (god forbid the code editor is closed). Or of
having to shuffle people around to tame the real blockers and bottlenecks
(with all the politically intrigue that entails).

It is possible to find optimal WIP and utilization points. But we routinely,
intuitively set these points too high — both in our personal lives, and work
lives (and as individuals and as groups/teams). Which means that the optimal
level is probably a tad uncomfortable. It feels _too focused, _or _a bit like
we are slacking_. But somehow the work happens. You know when you are on the
right track when there are _fewer _visible heroics, and _more _low drama flow.
There is more finishing, and less starting.

So lower WIP. Lower utilization rates. Now!

### Order-Takers vs. Value-Builders

Front-line individual contributors touch the machine, and they care about
impact. They’ve survived silver bullets, rush-jobs, the sting of being asked
to cut corners, and the scourge of shiny objects. They know what it is like to
work for months on something, only for the effort to be canned, or perhaps
worse for the work to get shipped and go unused by customers.

At the core you have questions of individual agency, autonomy, craft, and a
desire to create impact. Passionate problems solvers don’t want to be order-
takers. Unless the problem is solved (in the near and long term), they don’t
feel satisfied. In my career, I have heard this over and over ….

> It is like a conveyor belt. We are rewarded for output. It is unclear
whether any of this stuff even work! I didn’t get into this business to be a
ticket-machine.

This isn’t just a front-liner thing. You hear the same thing from managers,
and VPs who are measured on their responsiveness and output vs. the value they
create and maintain. We sometimes call this “getting a seat at the table”, but
plenty of people I know who sit at the “table” have the same struggles.

I don’t have a magic point here. Just thinking out loud and making clip-art
cartoons. I think the “point” is that at the root of many debates about
software development you have humans and their need to create impact (vs.
other needs for control, certainty, and credit-taking).

Consider these power dynamics …

# 15 Shared Service Tips &amp; Gotchas

AKA: Seduced By Economies of Scale…

* * *

### 15 Shared Service Tips &amp; Gotchas

#### AKA: Seduced By Economies of Scale…

What’s not to like? It’s the BEST OF BOTH WORLDS!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WxOIbVOZb6OkJdJtXb9E6g.png)

Insert random sell-piece here …

First a definition:

> A shared service is a capability that is centralized within an organization
or group. The capability is wrapped in a service with a well defined service
contract with the expectation that all teams use the service unless they can
justify a reason to go their own way. Shared services are a common operational
strategy designed to reduce costs by eliminating repetition of effort. By
providing a service in one place, there is an opportunity to optimize and
standardize it at scale. ([source](http://simplicable.com/new/shared-
services))

Some pondering and tips (with a bias towards software oriented shared services
and product managers):

  1. **Why shared service?** Is the working model delivering the expected value to the business, internal customers, and end-customers? The decision to move something to a shared service is based on many assumptions. It’s important to regularly re-validate those assumptions. You can get ten stakeholders in a room who “agree” the shared service is a valuable idea, but disagree about _why_ it is valuable, and disagree about whether it is living up to that promise. We often assume it’s the _only way_, and that’s rarely the case. The interesting thing is that shared services are a Nested How. We assume we’ll deliver more end-customer value by leveraging:  
 — Consistency and control, centralized business logic  
 — Interoperability and standards  
 — Safety and risk prevention  
 — Distributed specialization  
 — Requires cross-concern visibility/access  
 — Cost savings. Economies of scale  
 — Accelerate growth. Jump-start or kick-start initiatives  
So … what outcomes are you expecting? Where’s the data? Is the shared service
working? Is that end-customer value and business value materializing?

  2. **What’s working? How do we amplify _that_? **Too often, shared services are based on some vague forecast of economies of scale, some Excel voodoo, a team making a power grab, or a resourcing constraint amid rapid growth. What’s missing are clear and focused wins to amplify. Start with something that works before trying to solve a problem with the org-chart. Stick to the simple question: “is it working right now?” Can we amplify what’s working? Validate something works BEFORE shifting the org-chart.
  3. **Product Traps!** Shared services can fall victim to all of the traps that plague external products: the platform trap, premature optimization, going too broad, unvalidated complexity, accumulating technical debt too quickly, faulty business models, etc. We tend to forget this because the market is “internal”, but the rules all still apply. Something can be great for end-customers, but terrible for the provider. Or vice versa. Validate product / market fit early and often. Beware the Franken-Service that wouldn’t last a day in the “real world” as a product. It probably won’t be viable in the long term internally either.
  4. **Seductive Assumptions**. When you find yourself confidently saying “we should only solve IT once”, remember that you need to understand that ITs are rarely as simple as they seem. Five different types of customers using IT represent five potential paths for the shared service. The IT needs to eventually deliver end-customer value.
  5. **Divergent solutions** are a way to avoid premature optimization, and to keep your options open. The divergent solution approach may be preferable, as long as you can converge when you need to. Oftentimes, you see a bias for shared services because the organization lacks the ability to converge when it needs to.
  6. **Internal Medicine**. While susceptible to all of the standard product traps, shared services have some unique gotchas. It can be hard to say “No” to internal customers. You can’t fire internal customers. There are pressures to be responsive and pragmatic in the face of unrealistic demands. You often don’t get to pick your “ideal customer”, or shape your roadmap for long term viability over short-term gains. Lastly, even if your work can be directly linked to revenue, it can be hard to break out of the “less is more” / operating cost bucket. Startups are hard. Startups inside of companies — with internal teams as customers — are harder.
  7. **Consulting-to-product** _is _a viable startup model. But it is a hard thing to pull off. You have to be super disciplined and incorporate the learnings from each consulting “job” into a viable product. Consulting-to-product is very common for shared services, which is funny because it is literally one of the hardest things to get right in the “real world”. This would be fine if the assumptions surrounding a shared service didn’t rely on some massive economy of scale (likely unachievable in a consulting model). When someone talks about a “consultative” focus … step wisely.
  8. **Cash on Delivery**. Do your internal customers leave with the work-product in hand? Or do you maintain the product for them? Internal teams have a nasty habit of doing things that would absolutely destroy a startup. If each successive project adds complexity to “the product”, then you’ll need enough person-power to keep that added complexity at bay. Which means you’ll need a funding model built on the continuous delivery of capabilities instead of the completion of individual projects.
  9. **Take A Ticket**. Watch out for working agreements that bias you to premature convergence around solutions. This is a hallmark of the “take a ticket” or auctioneer approach. Instead of focusing on the value side — the outcomes we’d like to create — there’s a tendency to slip into a prescriptive feature assembly line. Startups have the same challenge when they attempt to auction off their roadmaps to new customers. The end result is feature-soup and a nonlinear (non-economically-viable) increase in complexity.
  10. **Refactor**. As a shared service, are you doing custom and/or experimental work? Are the requirements 100% known from now until eternity? Here’s the trouble … as a shared service you absorb all of the risks for doing custom/experimental work and delivering incremental value, and none of the reward. When stuff goes wrong, and you need to do a big refactor, where are the resources? Worse yet, you get blamed for not being clairvoyant. Be very diligent about communicating risks and forging time for refactoring.
  11. **Autonomy Hit**. Shared services make _so _much sense. Economies of scale FTW. But we rarely take into account the hit on autonomy for all involved. Dedicated resources leveraging a narrow shared service with smaller scope can outperform a “take a ticket” / heavy-dependency shared service 5:1. Once someone / somewhere feels there’s a chance in hell of getting away with fewer resources, it can be hard to change their mind … even when it’s obvious that something isn’t working. Be ruthless about exposing the hit on autonomy. Always ask “can you deliver the desired consistency without centralized control?” Resist the temptation to install rigid control structures when the same outcome can be achieved with a less heavy hand.
  12. **The “generic platform trap”** is as real for shared services as it is for startups. Customers will do magical things with your extensible set of tools! As with startups, this is a big, big assumption. Startups end up having to prop up professional services teams to “teach” people how to use the platform, and to develop case studies and white-papers that demonstrate validated solutions to real-world business problems. Or, they get stuck trying to serve too many personas. My advice: solve actual problems. Resist the platform trap. Worry about platform-izing later.
  13. **Don’t be the boiled frog**. Lead time starts to slip. Maintenance overhead increases. Internal customers stop having confidence in your work. Things aren’t _terrible, _but they aren’t at their best. This _drift into failure _can go on for a long time before you hit a wall. Don’t let this happen. Pivot early. Like any business there is a chance that the shared service simply isn’t viable. Don’t beat a dead horse. It is tempting to see failure in shared services as an individual failure, or a planning failure. But sometimes the business model for the shared service is simply not viable.
  14. **Real Value (Not Proxies)**. Link your shared service to capabilities and core business metrics … not proxy metrics. Otherwise you will be forever viewed as an operating expense, with all the headcount gymnastics that entails. Capabilities always require care, attention, and iteration. If you assume a project factory approach (aka “take a ticket and wait” or “the auctioneer”), you run the risk of letting the capabilities falter. Get funded based on value delivered. You _must_ tie in your work to end-customer / end-user value. All too often, shared services trigger forms of local optimization. Up go the defenses and the rigid boundaries. Again, the challenge becomes making the org chart work, instead of delivering value. Flip the script … value, value, value.
  15. **Learn the responsible “No”**. Sure the customer may be someone you interact with frequently. They might even be your friend. But for the health of the overall product, sometimes you need to say “No”.

#### Where does your shared service fit on the following ?

There’s no right or wrong here, but this list might be helpful for further
teasing out assumptions …

  * Emergent vs. mandated
  * Pushed to customers vs. pulled by customers
  * Reduces local variability vs. facilitates local variability
  * Transactional vs. integrated
  * Shared service and customer retain autonomy vs. teams are highly dependent
  * Scale with minimal cost increases vs. scale with linear cost increases
  * Distributed ownership vs. centralized ownership
  * Custom product vs. commodity product
  * Broad service offering vs. narrow service offering
  * Touches end-users vs. far from end-users
  * Linked to revenue vs. viewed as operating expense


# PMs: Say “I Don’t Know” More Often!

As PMs, we’re programmed to have an answer for every question.

### PMs: Say “I Don’t Know” More Often!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NofM19vw_FzX0o40bhPurg.png)

As PMs, we’re programmed to have an answer for every question.

> What’s the problem? What’s the solution? What exactly does the customer
want? Did it work? What’s next? What is the competition doing?

It can become part of our identity. And that’s dangerous. Because we start
fooling ourselves that we have all the answers. We stop being curious, we stop
listening, and we stop being humble. This is made more complicated by the fact
that we’re rewarded for decisiveness, instincts, mapping the road, and putting
together “killer decks”. Just Ship It!

So here is your goal for the next 7 work days. Repeat 3x per day. Say **“I
don’t know”**. And then say, **“I think we can learn more by [some next
step].”**

What you’ll quickly learn is that often your real value as a PM is having a
good guess about where to go for context and answers … not _having_ all of the
answers. And the strongest teams aren’t the one’s that pretend they bat 1.000
(success theater), but bat .388 … and humbly double-down on what works.

Don’t assume people are aligned when they agree on a solution or next step.

* * *

### “That’s A Great Idea!”

Don’t assume people are aligned when they agree on a solution or next step.

They might not agree on the Why. Which means a couple things …

  1. When/if the solution fails, you’ll be stuck
  2. If the solution “wins”, you might not agree why it is a winner
  3. You won’t know what to dampen (negative byproducts)
  4. You won’t know what to amplify (positive byproducts)

Junior PMs often think “stakeholder Alignment” is the process of getting
people to agree on a what to do next. It _feels _like the right thing to do
(and is frequently rewarded). Great job!

> Hey. Everyone agreed it was the right thing to do!

Over the years I’ve learned that alignment around solutions is rarely a _deep
_alignment. It is transient and short-lived.

Figure out the Why. Why is everyone excited about this idea? Are participants
excited for different reasons? Build shared understanding and alignment around
the Why. Then invite your team to propose other solutions that meet those
Whys. Rinse. Repeat.


# Agile Didn’t Eat Your Homework…

### Agile Didn’t Eat Your Homework…

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vJ5F3ZmNyG7q9xMQeGl_bQ.png)

A bit of a vent here …

I’m tired of reading articles that blame Agile for [insert org dysfunction
here]. I’ve heard it all. Agile is about short-term thinking. Agile creates
bad design. Agile is micromanagement. Agile sends you into iteration hell.
Agile inspires [some thing you don’t like].

And it is not because Agile is my gospel or pays my personal bills.

Yes, Agile has become a bit polluted by consultants, certifications, and the
promise of “transformation”. Same with DevOps. Same with Sun Tzu. Same with
the Stoics. Same with the Gospel. Same with any [insert idea here] that graces
book covers, and gets bandied about boardrooms as a quick fix. Or gets joined
with every part of the org chart to form new buzzwords … Agile [insert
functional silo here]. This is inevitable. Good things get abused.

Agile is what it is … some interesting (and timely, and inspired) ideas that
inspired a community, which inspired more ideas (repeating, until you get some
really, really good ideas, and people who are passionate about sharing them).
Those ideas — and that community — is “Agile”. And it is a prolific and
interesting community. The word feels cargo-cultish and vapid, but the
community is (largely) not. The image of an exec snorting “we need to be
Agile!” is a little sickening, but so is the word “synergy”.

A good chunk of the software developing world has experienced Agile via
crappily implemented Scrum. But that is not really the point. [Agile !=
Scrum](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11469358/what-is-the-difference-
between-scrum-and-agile-development).

The point is … Google and Wikipedia is your friend. There are many, many
traditions wrapped up in what we know as Agile. As individuals involved in
product development, it is your responsibility to do your homework and know
your history (hint, the history extends way before Snowbird, Utah). It pisses
me off when the product or UX community rattles on about Agile, and then can’t
describe its OWN tradition, or how their tradition translates into the current
context.

So this isn’t about defending an overblown word (turned community, turned
hashtag, turned invoice line-item). It is about thinking beyond the simplistic
— we “do Agile”, we don’t get results, therefore it must be Agile — thinking.
I’d say the same for any “way”, or hoping any “way” will solve all of your
problems. Stop looking for the silver bullet for your org. Learn, roll your
own, rinse, repeat.

Become a student and learn. Do your homework. And then write blog posts.

Most roads wont start and end with Agile. But most will pass through it.

### Developer on Fire Podcast (w/Dave Rael)

A couple weeks ago, I had the pleasure of doing the [Developer On
Fire](http://developeronfire.com/episodes) podcast with Dave Rael . The audio
is about 45m. I figured that reading it might (and that is a huge might) be
interesting. It isn’t a great transcription. And sometimes I read like 3rd-
grader. Anyhow …

[**Episode 240 | John Cutler - Making Value**  
_John Cutler is keenly focused on user experience and evidence-driven product
development. He mixes and matches
various…_developeronfire.com](http://developeronfire.com/podcast/episode-240
-john-cutler-making-value "http://developeronfire.com/podcast/episode-240
-john-cutler-making-value" )[](http://developeronfire.com/podcast/episode-240
-john-cutler-making-value)

**Dave: Why are you so lit up about making stuff for people?**

**John:** I think that part of it is the experience of working with other weirdos and makers and other people. I obviously take a lot of pleasure out of building something that someone uses and gets value out of, but it’s the whole process that I like. I like the challenge of it. I like the fact that things are often sort of unclear and I like all the weird banter from the people on my team and the characters that we have. I think it’s the variety of people and you’re not really battling this corporate stuff when you’re in the zone as a team, and that’s what I really like about it.

**Dave: Cool. That really paints a picture. You emphasize something there of enjoying the journey. It’s not all about a destination. It’s not all about some finished product. That you are getting something out of the actual experience of interacting with team mates and I think that’s something we can really take something away from.**

**John:** I don’t spend a lot of time writing code, but I usually ask my teams, if you controlled the budget, would you hire me? I feel that the product manager’s role is often misunderstood, or it’s stereotyped, just like the engineering role is often stereotyped.

> If you controlled the budget, would you hire me?

When you peel it away and you boil back to the people involved, there’s a lot
more diversity than we make it out to be. I like being there in the trenches
and adding value where I can and adding context where I can. Something that
I’ve noticed about a lot of engineers is that … I don’t think people outside
of engineering truly understand what it’s like to have to show up and make
those types of cost benefit decisions all day. Being deep in the code and then
thinking about it or rolling back their chair and having to ponder something
for a while.

> I don’t think people outside of engineering truly understand what it’s like
to have to show up and make those types of cost benefit decisions all day.

People from the outside look and say, if you don’t see hands on keyboard
there’s no work happening. When you’re there working with people, you
understand how reflective the work is. I like being part of that because I
think that adding context, helping people solve problems by giving them more
data and more information, is the number one way that you can help the other
makers and people on the team. That’s why I like the role and the role’s often
misunderstood, but I have my own version of it basically.

**Dave: Certainly, I think it is definitely misunderstood when somebody says product manager, I think that’s a different kind of a role in every organization I’ve been in. You mentioned that you don’t do a lot of coding. Can you tell me a little bit about your background just so that listeners get familiar with? Are you a coder?**

**John: **No. Developers on my team nicknamed me Sudo. That’s my nickname. I did have a startup or two startups where I got pretty decently into Rails. I could get through to the end myself, but I kind of knew the limits of … The limit wasn’t … It’s kind of hard to admit. The issue I had with coding is how deep I got into it as a personality, and I think that’s because there’s a certain point when you have a problem solving mindset, but there’s just part of the guts that you don’t quite understand. When I got heavily into Rails it was like a big eye opener. If you understood where you needed to get, there were nouns and verbs that you could make work. I would go so deep man.

> The issue I had with coding is how deep I got into it as a personality

I wouldn’t go to sleep for days on end, and I built like a personal challenge
site called, ‘Go for 30’. The whole idea is very Meta because my goal was to
relaunch the thing in 30 days. My personal 30 day challenge was building my
own product in 30 days. That was my challenge, to spend all day doing it. I
did that, I did some other prototypes for people, but it was mostly in Ruby on
Rails and then I got into some Python stuff for doing analysis. That’s the
extent of my background there, but it’s something about … I don’t know how the
great engineers I know do it, because you’ve got to solve the problem. There’s
a binary way to solve that problem and you can just hit your head against it.
I flirted with that, realized I had other things to add to this, some other
types of ways of thinking.

> I don’t know how the great engineers I know do it, because you’ve got to
solve the problem. There’s a binary way to solve that problem and you can just
hit your head against it.

My background was music and just figuring out my 20s. I had a post recently on
about people being drifters and I think that especially those of us in tech,
there’s the stereotypes and that’s how a lot of people got to it. I worked
with a great engineer who had discovered engineering a lot later in life, and
they took a whole different path with their life. That’s me. I don’t know if I
answered the question, but I’m all over the place and I don’t care.

**Dave: What is the role of a product manager?**

**John:** You could take the Meta perspective. The role of the product manager is to find out what the system needs and then apply yourself to that part of the system. That’s a little weak.

I have my version of it, which is you are a context builder. You are bringing
information to the team. You’re bringing system’s thinking, you’re bringing
decision making frameworks, you’re bringing valuable things. You’re not there
to control the team. You’re not there to rush the team. You’re not there to
tell them to cut corners. You’re there to help them with data and facilitation
and other things to move along the process. I think also you bring a big
library of interactions with businesses and users and other things like that.
It’s that sixth sense like, ”Hey guys, this seems like I’ve been here before.”

> You are bringing information to the team. You’re bringing system’s thinking,
you’re bringing decision making frameworks, you’re bringing valuable things.
You’re not there to control the team.

They want a custom field but they don’t want a custom field. They really don’t
want that. Or, they say they’ll pay for that once we deliver that, they’re not
going to pay for that once we deliver that.

I think that you bring experience in these interactions with users and
customers, and also just knowing that surprises happen. I remember when we had
the bartending game. We were demoing it and someone took the mouse and then
picked up the shaker and then started shaking their mouse, and we were like,
“That’s genius. Wouldn’t that be so cool? Wouldn’t that be so funny if people
play the game and you see them shaking the mouse back and forth?” I think as a
product person you understand too, where to look for happy accidents and
opportunities and stuff.

Not all PMs are the same. Some people work in very transactional environments
where their responsibility is to show up in a meeting once a week, tell people
what status is and go back to the teams and what they call herd cats. That’s
not my background, but I could see environments maybe where that role’s
required. It’s just not my thing.

**Dave: Yeah, that doesn’t sound so appealing. It’s not having the impact on the product in the way that you talk about and the way your blog depicts. I think that’s the contrast. You had a blog post about the evolving role of the product manager and that very contrast there, right. Kind of the old way of looking at it, so the command and control, they’re pushing the team in certain directions versus being a part of the team. Being somebody who brings that interaction. I think that’s really a big thing there is that a lot of … It’s a stereotype. A lot of engineers have some difficulty with understanding what it is that somebody else wants, and that role to try to bring out the thing that is really needed. The thing that’s going to truly deliver value, not necessarily just the thing that’s being explicitly requested, but that thing that’s going to actually solve the problem.**

**That’s a unique talent, and that’s something that not a lot of people have.**

**John:** It’s also something you have to spend time on. This is where the balance with teams. Literally one hour ago I’m talking with an engineer before this podcast about particular … We had a couple support requests sitting around and in an environment where someone’s responsibility is to sit there and triage them and then give the team permission to work on one of them or the next one, you do this and you do that. We were talking about it and he made a point. He said, “That thing you were working on until 10 o’clock last night, where you were talking about the big missions we need to solve, and how you were making sense of the problem, is 10 times more valuable than coming in and trying to help us project manage ourselves to do these things.”

That meant a lot. It shows that we have respect for those things. We all wear
hats. Sometimes you need that i-dotter and t-crosser because just doing those
things could take a whole day for someone. There’s never a solid answer for
this about what someone should do or shouldn’t. It’s like a contract with the
team. Like how do we want to split what we’re really good at here? Then also
knowing the difference between a project manager and product manager.
Sometimes you need someone with that amazing skill, which I actually don’t
have. I’m not a great i-dotter t-crosser.

> We all wear hats. Sometimes you need that i-dotter and t-crosser because
just doing those things could take a whole day for someone.

**Dave: Sure. That’s totally great. We’ve mentioned your blog a few times here, you’re a prolific blogger, you’re getting a lot of attention. Some of the things that you put out there really resonate with people, especially with application developers. Tell me a little bit about that experience. Why do you write the blog and what’s the ultimate objective?**

**John:** I think that a little bit of me thinking out loud. I’ve joked that if I had this conversation with the people around me all day at work and loved ones at home, that I would annoy the crap out of them. I mean literally. It would annoy the shit out of everyone.

Sometimes it’s because I had a really good day and it forced me to understand
what something happened a decade ago in my life or with teams, like what was
wrong about that situation. I’m constantly pattern matching, I’m constantly
reflecting and this is just my way to get it out there.

I had an engineer friend who said one day, “Look, I write test driven
development. What does test driven product management look like?” That hit
home in a big way. I was, “Oh, you live in a world where there’s right and
wrong and I’m just telling you to just do stuff.” I think that was an eye
opener. The couple of posts that had engineer attention really hammered home
for me. That we all want to create impact. I think that some people are in
environments where they just kind of give up on the business. They’re just
like, “You know what? This is just going to play its course. Same old BS,
whatever. We have a tight team. We’re hacking away. This is a good thing and
we enjoy this.”

> I had an engineer friend who said one day, “Look, I write test driven
development. What does test driven product management look like?” That hit
home in a big way.

I just think especially as engineers get older and more … over time, that
stops becoming something they can just forget about. Because the technical
challenges become more common as your career develops, but the impact
challenge becomes something that digs into you as you get into your 30s or
40s.

**Dave: Yeah, definitely. One of my biggest experiences was that I designed a system from the ground up to make life a lot better for this company that was an amalgamation of different companies that had been acquired, and replacing all of the legacy systems with this new thing. It over time started to gain traction. Everybody started buying into the architecture and it started to … Some of the emphasis that I had put there on autonomy and teams being able to do their own thing and test and deploy independently and all of these stuff, it took hold and then the company shifted priorities and wound up blowing up the whole organization. All of that effort just went up in smoke. There’s just such a punch in the gut on that.**

> All of that effort just went up in smoke. There’s just such a punch in the
gut on that.

**I’m not quite sure what my question is, it really resonates with me that that impact is so important, so vital in our experience.**

**John:** I see some movements like craft movements, like code craft movements and things. I’m really psyched about those movements, but I think that there’s a little bit of a retrenching back into the silos of it. It’s a little bit like, I don’t feel that my work has impact but if I join this craft community, at least I know there’s craft for work that I can do. When I think about product development, I think of an overarching development craft that we all participate in.

> It’s a little bit like, I don’t feel that my work has impact but if I join
this craft community, at least I know there’s craft for work that I can do.

A great example there is how you build a machine has as much impact on the
ability of that company to scale and do what it needs to do and achieve new
other opportunities, then the UX of that thing. Thinking about code as a way
to also scale the organization in a smart way, those things are massive. When
you look at a lot of companies that are “successful”, but they’ve let all that
stuff fall by the way side. They have their hands completely tied. They go out
and start to buy other companies. They go out and start … Because the only way
… It’s not a problem of cash. They’ve got the cash but they can’t apply the
cash to the problem internally, so they’re going to spend the cash outside to
get that result.

> When you look at a lot of companies that are “successful”, but they’ve let
all that stuff fall by the way side. They have their hands completely tied.

I think every person has been in a situation like that where you knew that
this was going to happen as an engineer. You knew that at some point they were
all going to hit the wall because you weren’t thinking about the thing. People
don’t pay their money and walk out with a pair of shoes. It’s much more like a
service ecology. We all come into work like coming in to work in a restaurant,
we all can make the restaurant work better. Sometimes we pull things off the
menu, we add to the menu, we figure out how to prep dishes better. For that
reason, I think it’s really exciting because I think the engineers on the team
and how you architect the product, has as much to do with the long term
viability of the company as these other things.

I know we got way off topic there, but I’m thinking about that sense of
impact. That all engineers should know that they have the ability to create
immense impact in their companies. Even with what are considered more “back
end decisions” or architectural decisions.

**Dave: I think that’s a lot of what you say with the blog and from the things you’ve said here. Not to the detriment of building the system right, because that does set you up. If you leave that, if you have rocked in the quality of what’s below, then that’s ultimately you’re going to pay a price for that as well. Both of those are things that matter.**

**John:** One thing I actually… I think I started a blog post about it, but then I stepped back from it. I think the dichotomy of build the right thing and build the right thing right, what you see in organizations is you see that create silos in the organization. You see it basically, the CTOs saying, “Well, you got to figure out what the right thing is and then I’ll be able to build it right.”

Product is saying like, “Well, we might need to build to figure out what that
right thing is.” Sometimes you need to build it right for right now and so
what you see in organizations, instead of focusing on resiliency and the
ability to change course. Instead we get obsessed with building “an extensible
platform that blanket-y, blanket-y, blanket-y, blanket-y, blank, blank, blank”

> Instead we get obsessed with building “an extensible platform that
blanket-y, blanket-y, blanket-y, blanket-y, blank, blank, blank”

That’s kind of true on a level, but there’s a platform myth. The point instead
of feeling like you’ve got to get everything right, right now or you’re never
going to come back and change it. I ask product managers, “When was the last
time you pulled a feature?” If I ask that to 100 PMs at a conference, only
three will raise their hand. Engineers are being perfectly rational to assume
that none of their architectural decisions have any kind of tweak-ability to
it. Because they understand that they don’t get the time to go back and fix
it. We’re caught in this terrible cycle. Now, if we could just say, “No, we’re
always going to refactor this, we’re always going to think about the current
state of the system and if you need time to do that, we’ll let you do that.”
It changes the game completely.

> I ask product managers, “When was the last time you pulled a feature?” If I
ask that to 100 PMs at a conference, only three will raise their hand.

You don’t create divisions around doing build it right, build a right thing.
You work together as partners in that. If that makes any sense.

**Dave: I totally like that vision and I think it’s a shame that more organizations aren’t like that. How can the engineer out there who feels like they are turning out features. How can they go about trying to move their organization towards something a little more like that?**

**John:** There’s this great book called ‘The Phoenix Project’, that I would recommend that anyone reads. It’s really, really good and if you haven’t read it, it follows this fictional IT team’s effort in their organization. At a certain point, they were very stuck in reactive work and all the things that we see. For example, invisible work.

Any engineer understands this idea of invisible work. Where if you actually
told everyone about the work you were doing, they would say don’t do it or why
are you doing it? So you take on the invisible work and it sits back there.
You have to create the trust that you can talk about what you’re actually
working on. The turnaround in the Phoenix Project is about someone from the IT
organization going straight to the CFO of the company and understanding how
that company prints money.

> So you take on the invisible work.

Then, it talks about how instead of thinking about engineering as a resource
that you think about, they thought about it as a way to create money or save
money. Or add learnings in that thing. This is where the product thinking for
engineers is critical. If you spend a month on something it costs 10 X that
amount to maintain the complexity you’ve added. The cost of engineers working
for two months is not the cost. It’s in the complexity you’ve added to the
thing that you’ve built. What I would say to an engineer caught in this
situation is, it’s tough to do from the bottom up but it’s to try to change
the mindset from your manager or their manager from one of  
“our job is to be responsive to the business” and instead to think about, our
job is to partner with the business.

> The cost of engineers working for two months is not the cost. It’s in the
complexity you’ve added to the thing that you’ve built.

I’ve known engineers who in five hour hack days saved the company a couple
million dollars. That is awesome. You don’t notice, especially teams that
don’t have a product manager or maybe have a more technical product manager,
you don’t have that team put that up on the banner for the company.

Is it saving money, making money or adding learning which is valuable? Then
thinking about that instead of thinking about how many things are in our
backlog and just checking them off the list or something. I don’t know. A
little bit of product thinking can go a long way for an engineer and a little
bit of engineering thinking can go an incredibly long way for any product
manager.

**Dave: I like that, totally. You mentioned that term empathy and it goes both ways. I guess it’s something really important that we can learn something from each other, but that idea of shifting from, I have something that you have directed me to do, to, I’m an autonomous creature who can make suggestions for how we can turn this thing in the right direction. That’s a pretty powerful shift there.**

**John:** Just start with the leadership of the engineering organization too. Because one thing I’ve noticed is usually a company will be going great and then will go through a tough time. The engineering leadership gets put on the spot about execution. We just need to execute. If the engineering leadership thinks they’re primary responsibility is to just execute. If you tell us exactly what to build, we can build it when you need to build it by at this particular point.

The reality is you get rewarded for it. All the incentives fall into being a
great order taker instead of creating business outcomes.

> The reality is you get rewarded for it. All the incentives fall into being a
great order taker instead of creating business outcomes.

I think that that’s a … It’s a really complex discussion, but if you can think
about the whole system, you begin to see little chinks in the armor. Recently
actually I went to an executive and I said something like, “If we could give
you all this right now, how much money would you pull out of your pocket to
solve this, to just get the solution to this?” Then they were like, “Oh no, no
how much is it going to cost?” I’m like, “No, that’s not what I’m asking you
about.” “Well, are you saying compared to what I think another team could do?”
I’m like, “No. What is the value if you could get this problem solved right
now? You wake up tomorrow morning and this problem is solved.”

What was fascinating is that was an incredibly scary question for some of the
executives but not for other executives. Some other executive was like,
“$25,000,000 if you could solve it right now. I would buy that for
$25,000,000.” Think of how different that conversation is from an engineering
organization that said, “How many weeks will that take you? How many weeks
will that take you? How many weeks will that take you?”

That’s a completely different … That’s not a value based decision. Someone
else is trying to decide that. This obsession with estimates. I think that
estimates can be important as partnership and as discussion about value, but
if all of it is a client server relationship with the team and what’s going
on, I think things begin to breakdown. That’s the other trick, think about
value, think about dollars, think about solutions like that and then that
doesn’t get into the how.

> I think that estimates can be important as partnership and as discussion
about value

It’s getting into the what. It’s getting into the why and the who is going to
get the value. Again, basic product thinking can go a long way.

**Dave: That’s great. I like that view of it’s important to know what it is the … What is the outcome that you are trying to achieve? And without that it’s just going through motions. You said, order taker. That you become just an order taker. I think that also, I’ve talked to a lot of software developers about that in a role as a software developer, there is a ceiling on what you can earn. I think a lot of it is related to what you’re talking about there. That if you get into this mode of being an order taker, then you’re labor. You’re really not a valued part of the organization. You’re somebody who turns hours into features.**

**John:** Actually, it’s way more structural than anyone wants to admit. If you think about a company as operating expenses, and then they have capital expenses, and they’re buying assets and they’re doing different things. For a software as a service company, there’s rules that relate to what you can book as a capex expense or an opex expense. It’s like 42 person weeks is some investment we’re making in our technology that’s innovative or something like that. The other operating expenses, you actually go into separate … When you report to your investors or do whatever, that goes in a different spot. From that super high level, especially with the systems we’re creating there these days which are much more iterative, if you take a step back you think it’s actually easier for your company to go and buy another company in some ways. Because of where it’s going to book that cost.

I think that this is getting super deep with it, but engineers too, to break
out of that type of thinking. Again we have to think about what is that
problem they’re solving and thinking about that they’re enhancing the … That
by innovating they’re enhancing the value delivery capacity of their company
and then trying to advocate for the right line item that your bosses are
booking what you’re doing.

The funny thing about that is that when engineers are asked to track time on
something, almost all the time in a larger organization the time tracking is
going about allocating those costs. When we resist that, because it’s like
who’d want to track their time, it actually has the perverse end product of
not being able to put that time towards the innovative activities and getting
booked as an operating expense. There’s all these games.

Figure out how companies work, figure out how their accounting works and then
to your point I think that promulgates that order taker thing. It’s super big,
it’s bigger than all of us.

**Dave: How did you realize that this was something … I can just see your whole expression light up, that this is really … It’s just, you’re on fire about these stuff. How did you get to this point?**

**John:** I just really love the idea of people making things and getting together and doing it. If you saw me you light up about talking about these systemic issues, I love stuff like that. I love it for a perverse reason. Because so many of these things we get down in the weeds about in our company. I think especially with engineers. You show up at a retrospective every week, and everyone’s talking about what’s working and what’s not working. There’s so much burden on us to continuously improve on a team level. What I love about what we were just talking about is that, there are bigger forces at play here in the software industry and how we make things, and what are some left over things from other by gone eras for how we build software.

> You show up at a retrospective every week, and everyone’s talking about

I’m excited by the possibilities that I think we have the chance to elevate
the makers and nerds and stuff. That’s what I get really excited about. It’s
less that I’m excited that it’s kind of messed up, but I’m more excited by the
possibilities that we could create if we understood how these economics were
working.

> I’m excited by the possibilities that I think we have the chance to elevate
the makers and nerds and stuff.

**Dave: A lot of opportunity. I just pictured you’re climbing up this hill and working really hard to do that, only to realize it’s the wrong hill. That there’s another hill you could be going up. That makes a lot of sense. In your experience I think, we can learn a lot about the times that things went well, but there’s probably even more during those down times. Could you just share a story? Tell us about a time that you failed, fell flat on your face or things just fell apart.**

**John: **Going way back in my early 20s making a game, we developed all kinds of adversary relationships with our publisher and all kinds of … Maybe I won’t go back that far, because it’s just all the classic things, but you’re just very … I think that the lesson there that I learnt is that when it’s your thing, you will never see things clearly when it is completely your thing. When it’s your thing, when you’re on the ground floor of something, the ability to stay unbiased and nurturing for that open source community versus who plays the evangelist role, who plays the facilitator role and those things, it plays a big part.

> you will never see things clearly when it is completely your thing

When it’s your thing, you’ve got blinders on and you almost have to realize
that. You almost have to do that. Those are those older stories. I’ve been at
startups that raised a ton of money and based on market research, like the
marketing did a quick focus group and their company raised $50,000,000 bucks
and then fell completely flat on its face.

There are some lessons there about you’ve got to get your … Two lessons
really. You’ve got to get it out there. The measure of success is someone
taking money out of their pocket and handing it to you for what you’re working
on, and that it fills a role. You can fool yourself on your projects or your
efforts that it has traction, but you’ll know it when you see it. If you find
yourself saying, “ Well, I wonder if, I wonder if, I wonder if, “all the times
I’ve been in where it’s just working, you could just say it’s just working.

I’ve had startups that have failed too, falling in love with writing, my 30
day challenge thing instead of … I just got so deep. I fell in love with the
machine which is okay, but I wasn’t opening my eyes up for the problem.
Because you know why? No one has … Like 1% of the population has the gumption
to do something for 30 days. I got so obsessed with doing it for 30 days and
building the model that these 30 day calendars and you do these things. At no
point was I like, “Wait, let’s make the length of the challenge variable.” I
was all in for 30 days. There’s stuff like that. I would say that on a
personal level, the mistakes I’ve made often have to do with not … I’d say
that a lot of us who fall on the category of who pride ourselves on calling it
like it is, and I know a lot of engineers fall in this role too.

It just that we feel that it’s our mission to just tell it as it is. There is
a right and there is a wrong and this is what it is. This is the situation and
this is how it works. Is I feel a kinship with a lot of the engineers, and I
know because we think the same way about that thing. I’ve made mistakes where
I definitely wasn’t empathetic to the other people in the business that that
is not how they think sometimes. I’ve put myself out there in ways that
backfired.

I would say that for a lot of engineers …. I have a couple of engineering
friends who’ve also fallen for that. They could have waited a week or two to
really form this thought together, but it was much more about, you’re wrong,
I’m right, this is how it’s supposed to be. Everything’s messed up, we’re not
doing it the right way. I think that that is, for some of us, that’s just how
we think and I think bringing in a little bit of the skills of reflection, to
say, “What is the 1% of truth missing?” Or, “The 10% truth missing.”

Also, I think a lot of engineers and myself too, we think in terms of systems
too. One trick for engineers that’s been helpful for me is to … If you imagine
the system around you is being highly political, unnavigable, overly
emotional, not logical, a good way is to get your head in the systems thinking
and thinking about distributed systems and thinking about complex systems.
Thinking about that, because you can actually help yourself. You can step back
and say, “No, this is not a room filled with people, just who aren’t cutting
it in the logic department.” There is a reason why this system exists like it
does, and see it more as a refactoring problem instead of a replacement
problem. You’re going to have to strangle the code sometimes.

You’re going to have to do cuts through the code. You need to integrate the
thing. If your idea is not seeming to take hold, it hasn’t integrated. The
test did not pass on what you’re trying to say. I’m just thinking that it can
be comforting to think that you can address the problems around you in your
natural zone, but not have to quote unquote play the game or be highly
political.

**Dave: Multiple processes running in this space with communications protocols between them that sometimes break down, yeah all those [crosstalk 00:40:14]. That’s cool. Tests against the system. You mentioned being asked the provocative question about test driven product management. I think you said, that there’s this realm of right and wrong in the engineering, but that’s not necessarily always the case. There is a lot of trying to figure out what this thing does and m I asking the right questions, and a lot of back and forth and is the test wrong? Or is the code that’s failing wrong and all of those kinds of things. Could you flesh about a little bit more? What are some of those commonalities? How can you do a little more of an approach of starting with the end in mind, which is I guess to me really the gist of test driven development.**

**John: **Yeah, totally. I think it can be … I have a very specific example that we do an exercise with teams sometimes, where we look at the data we have right now. A lot of teams get a little pissed off if you do something and then you just get shifted to some other project. What I would do with teams is to say, “Look, five months from now we’re going to present back to the organization, engineers as well as product people. We’re going to make a commitment to do that. We’re going to do tech talk, we’re going to do something about some work we did. What we’re going to do right now is we’re going to write the presentation right now. We’re not going to do it five months from now. We’re going to write the presentation right now, and we’re going to put the data we have now in the slide presentation and we’re going to leave the other charts empty. Or we’re just going to draw squiggle lines on them at the moment.”

> A lot of teams get a little pissed off if you do something and then you just
get shifted to some other project.

We’re going to get together and we’re going to do that as a team. Because
we’re all going to be on stage when we do it. So we all have to have pride in
what we show and we all have to think it passes master for the engineers, and
for the business people who are in the audience. So it’s setting a pretty high
bar. Before we even get started, we do that activity. In a way, it’s exactly
like creating a test. It is exactly like … But it’s not exactly like it, it’s
sort of you’re setting yourselves by, I think that what you see there is that
agreeing to talk about it later, is like agreeing that that test will run
every time you work on it. You put a stake in the ground that you will reflect
on whether the test does. Then you can also look at it periodically during
those five months.

If you have a … The thing that’s great about that is that is, even that team
was a temporary team and got shifted off to another effort in that company,
you still come back together as a team, and everyone wanted to know. Everyone
wanted to know whether it would work. I think that that can be … I’m just
giving an example to demonstrate the point, but I think that that’s an example
of how it can work. Put some emotion into it and start with the end point that
you’re willing to expose yourself to for the organization. Then work and agree
to come back to it later.

**Dave: That’s brilliant. I like it a lot. I like the idea of here’s the presentation and does it match reality. If not, why? Is reality better than this vision that we had before, and then … There’s lots of sources of feedback there. You’re figuring out whether you’ve hit the target and all of those things and what are the next steps. I think there’s a lot of meat in that. How do you stay current of what you need to know?**

**John: **Oh, men. That in itself … I just try to time box it. I have on my calendar every week time to try to reflect on the new stuff and read the stuff. I think that time management is incredibly difficult for product folks in a way that’s different than … Engineers are battling for their time in a different way. Keep us out of meetings. Keep us on this thing. For product, it is about getting shuffled between meetings all the time. Actually career development for product people is really challenging. I wanted to talk about that briefly. Because I think it’s something that engineer’s experience. I’ve been to conferences with engineers, or coaches or scrum masters or whatever and it’s always the product person’s fault.

It’s always, they’re not this genius, they’re not this fortune teller, they’re
not a super hero. And why can’t they tell us exactly what we need to build, we
feel like we’re … Actually and maybe that’d be even be good for some
situations. Sometimes you’re not even being told in that highly prescriptive
way what to build.

I think the challenge at the end of the day is that you really might have
unskilled product people on your team. They might have come from a project
environment and so I would say that trying to keep up with this is like a
lifelong thing, and you have to make time for it. Because otherwise … And you
have to spend time on your teams, because if you get pulled into a lot of low
leverage tasks as … If you’re all your acting as is, oh I went to the other
end of the building and they said we needed this, and so we got this and then
here is this thing.

If all you’re doing is you’re just like a … You’re just a part of the
communication network, that’s just a relay. If all you are is just a relay in
the organization, then you’re not adding value to that information that gets
passed through if you’re not amplifying it, or filtering it, or doing
whatever, you’re not adding value. The reason why it’s coming back to learning
is that, trying to figure out how to manage your time as a PM is the critical
thing to unlock staying current. Because the reason why people don’t stay
current is that they claim they just have no time at all.

It’s interesting that there’s a direct path to being an engineer. Computer
science grads or other paths. There are people who have been trained in this
and it’s obvious that they’re coming here, and product is much more of, we’re
pulling people in from different parts of the business and it’s not really as
much that you’ve got a formal background in it. That’s really interesting.

I think that this is one thing that I tell teams to do too is, there’s great
exercises that you can do. One is just called the hats exercise. You just
decide what hats you need and you give them funny names and you just
understand that on a team sometimes, you’ll be wearing different hats. It
doesn’t mean that that person needs to be wearing that hat all the time. You
always need a devil’s advocate. You always need someone who’s the unbiased
facilitator. You always need these things and I think that that’s an important
thing that product people can do to help define the role that they’re doing.
Because I don’t think that engineers understand how many hats we’re juggling
sometimes.

And just facilitate. Facilitate that product management just like product
development is a team game and everybody helps out. That’s great. I want to
wrap up by asking you my final question, to provide three tips for delivering
more value. They don’t have to be programming or product management related
but it certainly can be. Three things you do and recommend to really make sure
you deliver.

Figure out a way in your organization to pick up a phone and call a customer
directly right to the team. Even if it seems like not so fun thing to do, and
for a lot of people it’s fun. Get them on the phone, get working software in
front of them, get feedback directly from the source about the people who are
using what you’re using and don’t just ask them what they want. Really try to
… If you can bring that voice to the team, it’s a game changer for people.
Even if initially they say, “Well, is that really our responsibility or
whatever.” When you do it, you see people’s eyes light up. I would say that
that would be one very important thing. I think the second thing I alluded to
earlier is just stop, think about a world where you’re not the order taker,
where you’re the value maker and apply that to what you’re working on.

Ask questions that relate to that. Because I think that if you can take that
leap as a team, it just maps literally to your question. The main shift there
is that you have to think about economics, you have to think about how the
business makes money or saves money, and one thing I’ve noticed about that is
that I’ve never seen an organization that when a team actually gets up there
and reflects on their work from an economics standpoint. The problem is
usually middle management layer. If you can get a situation where you get the
upper, like a C level or VP level person who sees, here are the engineers
talking about the money they saved or the value that they created, and here’s
the data, oh my God the VP loves that.

It’s the people in between those that tend to want to run their little
territory. The reason why I say that in terms of creating value is the more
you can do that, the more autonomy you’ll get to create value. Because people
will be much more psyched about it. Those are the dollars and cents and
visibility thing. Then I think the final thing would be, resist premature
optimization in terms of process on your team. Every process you have is like
a hypothesis about how you’re going to work. It’s like any systems design. If
you over optimize around one factor dimension initially, it means that by
nature you don’t have flexibility. For example, things that are fun sometimes,
like pairing or mob programming or taking the day off to go and visit a
customer, feel wrong at the time.

They feel like a waste of time, but you think about your teams as building
resiliency on your team. The reason I say that is to create lasting value and
to get out of the order taker mindset, you need to have resiliency as your
team. If you’re fly by night, these are like distributed systems. It’s the
exact same thing we’re talking about. If you need the human load balance or
A.K.A project manager to function as a team, it will always be a limiting
factor on the success of your team. If you can figure out the minimal amount
of process necessary to solve the problem you need right now, and resist that
temptation, you can go a lot further towards creating value. Otherwise you’re
just going to play the part of the order taker. Those are the three I’d leave
you with.

**Dave: When parts of your distributed system are susceptible to flu, then you’ve got a chaos monkey that’s out there and knocking [crosstalk 00:50:41] all the time. That’s a great way to look at that. Thank you for those. Before we go, how can our listeners follow you and keep up with what’s going on in your world?**

**John:** Back to that time management thing, all I can have bandwidth for is Twitter. If you want to reach over on twitter, it’s @johncutlefish. It’s probably good, even LinkedIn, I can’t stand that thing. It’s twitter or you can email me. It’s my name, my middle initial is P at the place that starts with G, and then just email me there and we can chat.

**Dave: All right, great. I’m sure that twitter links up the medium blog, so they can go check out all that stuff too. Thank you John for your presence today. It’s been really great connecting.**

# The Value of “Non Feature” Work

As a PM, I spend a lot of time talking to engineers about product and
prioritization.

* * *

### The Value of “Non Feature” Work

As a PM, I spend a lot of time talking to engineers about product and
prioritization.

A common question looks something like this:

> We want to spend more time refactoring, re-tooling, and working down debt.
But it doesn’t generate revenue. How do you build a business case for this
type of work?

  * What would your company pay to double its current throughput?
  * How would a 50% reduction in throughput (less output) impact your company financially?
  * Assume you’ll need to “hire up” in a non-linear fashion to continue your current growth trajectory. How much would that cost?
  * How is the unmanaged complexity impacting you today? Is it lowering your ability to deliver quality product? Is it slowing you down? By how much? What opportunities are you currently foregoing due to current throughput? What are you spending to “make up” for the fact that you have trouble delivering validated impact?
  * How long does it take to onboard new developers? What might happen if you could halve that time? What would happen if it doubled?
  * How would a major production issue impact brand loyalty, renewals, and upsells?
  * Etc.

What you find — when you take these questions seriously — is that refactoring
is extremely valuable. There IS a business case, and it is basically
fraudulent to ignore those risks/opportunities. Product managers tend to be
better at pitching the value of new work, but that’s because they spend all
day pitching the value of new work.

What you also find (and engineers will hate me for this) is that without
carefully collecting data on throughput, defects, and the impact of your work,
you’ll have no data to back you your business case. Almost all problems
manifest initially as lengthening lead times and/or defect rates. New “stuff”
(unquantified shiny objects, even) will always beat nebulous “maintenance”
when that maintenance is not quantified. A great example here is documenting
unplanned side-work … if you don’t make this work “real”, there is no way to
discuss it.

And then there is pride and ego. We tend to be pretty defensive about past
architectural decisions. Admitting that some past decision is impacting the
business today can be a tough pill (even when the decisions were perfectly
valid at the time). Transparency requires safety, empathy, and humility. If
teams are punished for “pulling the cord”, they’ll stop pulling the cord.

When the transparency, safety, empathy, and humility is missing, the tendency
is to gloss over the drag. Which makes the “hit” — when the trouble really
starts — all the more difficult to process, and difficult to manage.

So… build the business case. Do it. Measure and reflect. Pitch the value of
craftsmanship.

P.S.: Product Managers! Encourage and teach your teams to think in economic
terms. Take them seriously. Prioritize apples to apples. Foster a safe
environment that’s friendly to discussing the economic impact of unmanaged
complexity.

### Is Your Data Science Team An Island?

I thought it might be interesting to use Search inside a multi-product SaaS
provider— my current product domain — to explore some interesting topics
around shared resources and complex internal service domains like data
science. The topic came up a couple times during conversations at MTP 2017
(especially among companies with complex offerings), so I’d like to continue
the conversation.

Here’s my simple overview of Search Relevance and UX. A user actively
searching provides a “hint” (and there are some Search-specific challenges),
but this is fairly similar to other data science problems.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kAHzTxmH28RTXx1RSlOQVQ.png)

At my current job, Search partners with other internal teams who understand
our various **User** personas and their **Goals. **We also partner with folks
who have a deep understanding of how to **Help** users achieve their goals in
certain contexts and while visiting certain touch-points (e.g. web-widgets,
Mobile SDKs, APIs etc.) And finally, we collaborate with individuals who are
experts in certain types of **Information**: things like support tickets, chat
threads, and knowledge content. Sometimes — when we’re lucky — this expertise
is embodied in a single person or team. And in other cases we need to cast a
wide net within the company.

For a complex business these distinctions are vital. The word _Product (_or
even _Multi-Product)_ is too simplistic. A single user persona may access many
touch-points, with multiple goals, and with access to various chunks of
information … all in a single day. It’s more of a service ecology.

Search teams (and other data science teams) cannot exist as remote tropical
islands. Nor can they exist as islands connected to the mainland solely by
Jira tickets, the promise of “extensible platforms”, heavy project management,
and prescriptive feature requests. There will always be some skills — Search
is a good example — where it is not feasible to hire dedicated resources. But
that does not preclude teams from deeply partnering and embedding for the full
duration of a “mission”… to the extent that for some period of time there is
only one big, cross-functional team. At the end of the day … if it touches UX
and the User, it can’t be done in a vacuum.

Deep integration of the teams, lessens the risk of:

  * Building **shiny objects** in isolation, that while shiny don’t really integrate well with the complete experience (ignores good UX) and/or leverage domain expertise
  * A **spray and pray** approach that adds a lot of bells and whistles, but introduces unmanageable and unsustainable complexity
  * Forcing **premature convergence** for the sake of “efficient” and well-coordinated (temporary) “projects”. And never really moving the needle. Once the effort really get’s going, the teams disperse

If the technology is “left behind” with our internal partners we’re lucky, but
most data science teams maintain certain tools, services, and infrastructure
that exist in a dynamic state. There’s a spectrum … some services are very,
very specific to certain emerging/novel use cases, other services are generic,
and there’s a host of stuff in the middle. To make matters even more
complicated, we might partner with other infrastructure / data engineering
teams to keep the ship afloat. The BIG danger here is assuming economies of
scale that may or may not exist, or assuming the technology stack (your stack,
and the extend internal partner stack) is static. It isn’t.

> The BIG danger here is assuming economies of scale that may or may not
exist, or assuming the technology stack (your stack, and the extend internal
partner stack) is static. It isn’t.

In the best case, the service evolves organically around actual problems (with
regular refactoring):

What’s interesting for me personally, is that this dynamic is not that
dissimilar from my prior work as a UX Researcher. The temptation with UX
Research is to do big-batch upfront research and “land” that research on a
team. This doesn’t really work. I’ve had much better results fully embedding
with teams, and taking the team along for the journey. Frequently, what we
thought was the problem (or would solve the problem) at first, proves to only
play a bit-part in the big picture. You can’t just jump ship at this point.

So some tips:

  * Work out an internal funding model that takes into account 1) the complexity you are maintaining (not just the “new stuff”), 2) the fragility of assumptions around economies of scale, 3) the maturity of your various engagements, and 4) the actual VALUE you are delivering vs. what you cost.
  * Keep your team extremely fluid and resist pre-optimizing around structure or process. Boundaries must be flexible.
  * Focus on actual problems not building platforms. Let the platform emerge as a result of a disciplined loop of iteration, converging generic components, and tackling new problems.
  * Know what constitutes your problem space, and make sure you have direct access to domain experts (for us it is Users, Goals, Touch-points, and Information). Don’t skimp, and get their full attention when it counts.
  * Embed deeply. Consider you and your collaborators as a single team. Resist the pull to multi-task and matrix simultaneously
  * Avoid premature convergence or adopting a “ticket-taker” / feature request / team Tetris.
  * Boil up the objective to the highest level possible. For example, Search exists as one component in an interface. Ask … “what makes the WHOLE interface effective for the User and their Goal (with the available Information)?” You might find that advanced data science approaches aren’t even required.

### Don’t Blindly Copy Ways

Why can’t you just copy [insert tech company here] and be successful? Why can
you know something is wrong, but be unable to improve the situation? Why is
the “superstar” exec successful in one domain, but falters in the next (or the
opposite … she gracefully adapts)? What forces must an internal change agent
marshal to catalyze change?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6fCHS-DV3UzYOviHyV3OdA.png)

There are seven key abilities/capabilities/concepts at play:

  1. The **Way **to go from one **Way** to another **Way**
  2. The **Way** to discover the right **Wa**y (for right now, and adapt accordingly)
  3. Why a **Way** is working (or not working)
  4. The **Way** it is (what are we actually doing?)
  5. How to make the current **Way** work
  6. Awareness that another **Way** is necessary
  7. The principles guiding all **Ways** for a particular domain (and ability to identify that domain)

You can have someone who is awesome at a particular Way (#5) … but lacks the
other skills (#1-#4,#6,#7). They may have a vague idea something is wrong
(#6), but perceive it to be poor execution of the current Way (#5). Or, they
self-identify with doing things a particular Way and they’re fearful— their
career and training depends on it — so they resist learning about first
principles (#7), and embracing change.

Similarly, you can have a situation where everyone is motivated to change
(#6), but no one knows how to discover that new Way (#2), how to get there
(#1), and exactly what is broken about the current Way (#3). So they “shop”
for new Ways to copy, without deeply understanding applicability for their
domain (#7) and Why that particular Way works (#3). Or an org that knows
exactly where it needs to go (#2, #3, #4, #6, #7), but has a very, very hard
time changing and adapting (#1).

Finally, you find “midas touch” leaders who have an incredible knack for
instilling #2 on their teams (discover the right way for right now),
understand first principles (#7), and are able to inspire the people on the
front lines to measure what’s working (#3), and own the change (#1). As long
as the domains are reasonably similar, they (and their orgs) excel.

You get the idea…combinations abound. Another way I’ve described this is as
follows. To “win” you need:

  1. Craft
  2. Ability to sense the demands of your environment
  3. Know how to adapt based on changes in your environment
  4. The leverage to adapt (time, money, resources, safety, etc.)

So when you find yourself wondering why something isn’t working … ask yourself
if all of these abilities are present and are functioning correctly. Also,
challenge yourself to think beyond roles, titles, and the current management
structure. Who can you involve in the activity that has the information you
need? How can you discover the Way as a team? How can you bake these skills
into your org culture?

### Product Management Must Adapt

I put together this leave-behind for a talk/training session. Medium doesn’t
do tables, so the best I can offer is this image (and this [link to a
pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B04yoW1JFDHGUTk2eTVuTU9vcDg/view?usp=sharing)).

What was the motivation for this compara-listicle? I keep seeing the same
practices/approaches/words/ideas that “worked” for wrapped products being used
for SaaS (Software as a Service). Considering that SaaS is almost geriatric by
tech standards, this is highly disconcerting. Throw in IoT, ML, AI, Zero
Interface … and that every service company is now a technology company … and
you’ve gotta wonder “can we evolve?”. We’re driving the feature factory, and
we have to stop.

Anyway … very busy the last two weeks, so apologies for not posting more.

  1. Hire smart, analytical problem solvers  
… many with advanced degrees, high EQ, diverse interests, and systems thinking
chops  
… who are highly accustomed to making cost/reward decisions in their work

  2. Sit them down at a desk in a noisy, public space so they are under constant scrutiny
  3. Ask them to deliver an executive’s investment ideas
  4. Measure those problem solvers and their managers by the _successful delivery _of those ideas
  5. Apply poor rigor at connecting those investments to business outcomes. Better yet, fast-track silver bullets to gloss over poor outcomes
  6. Rally them with success theater (that holds no water under the scrutiny of people who understand causation vs. correlation)
  7. Run them through a gauntlet of process, rituals, and cultural manifestos. Award shwag
  8. Make symbolic gestures to encourage diversity. Describe sexual harassment as an HR problem
  9. Pamper them with good coffee, gourmet food, “healthy” high-calorie snacks, and hackdays
  10. Optimize for keeping team busy, being responsive to the business, hitting deadlines, and adding complexity to the software that they must in turn refactor/support
  11. Celebrate technical excellence and craft (to keep them focused on “what they can control”)
  12. Send the ornery (but brilliant) ones off to solve big problems that let them be alone
  13. Encourage the less brilliant, but more moldable ones to ascend/descend into management
  14. Keep the others at their desks until they move on to the next gig (helps if they are single)


# It’s A Wonder Some Teams Get Anything Done

Or, why you should visualize ALL work and use Cost of Delay

* * *

### It’s A Wonder Some Teams Get Anything Done

#### Or, why you should visualize ALL work and use Cost of Delay

Let’s review two (scarily common) examples.

#### Examples

**Exhibit #1**. This team is working on two **initiatives**. Initiative 1 is “costing” the company $100,000 per month. Initiative 2 is “costing” the company $1,000,000 per month.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kqO7SqQtzcyNYFYv5vcKYg.png)

Work breakdown for a singe team

Cost of Delay (COD) is the “[partial derivative of the total expected value
with respect to time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_delay)”. ~30% of
the team’s capacity is being dedicated to those two value-add initiatives. The
rest of the team’s capacity is being “spent” on unplanned work (stemming from
unmanaged complexity), planning for future efforts, and task switching. Why
would any rational person work this way? Easy…to be responsive, stay busy,
show some progress on the CEO’s pet project, and pragmatically deal with tech
debt. What should they do instead? Something like…

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XizTcNXRDQ-w9qBNNhBFsw.png)

Working down the technical debt to limit the amount of unplanned work

Since the unplanned work saps capacity almost equal to the two value-add
initiatives combined, it might be wise to knock that out as quickly as
possible, especially given the non-linear nature of unmanaged complexity. It
could get gnarly fast. Unfortunately, this will be unpopular because “not
doing new stuff” is a psychological hit for a team.

**Exhibit #2**. Now let’s take a “shared” team (Team B). Maybe they’re a tools or infrastructure team. Lucky for them, they don’t have the same debt hanging over their head, but they do have to service two “high priority” projects (Team A swears this is high priority, and it literally may be their highest priority). There’s just one problem: one of the efforts (I2) is addressing 10x the cost of delay ($1,000,000 vs $100,000).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PXZw9ZfTSSXWFJRm-qRAeQ.png)

Shared team (Team B) is splitting its capacity between two projects. Why?

Is this bad? Of course! It’s terrible. Initiative 2 accounts for 10 Initiative
1s. If doing both adds one month to the completion of Initiative 2, then the
company will have “lost” $1,000,000. Why does this happen? I can think of many
reasons:

  * Team B has a specialized resource who can’t work on Initiative 2, so instead of training that person, they opt to keep those people busy on something else.
  * Team B didn’t push back on Team A because they were worried about being called unresponsive.
  * Someone promised a demo of Initiative 1. And in their spare time, a designer cranked out a mockup that everyone _loves_.

#### Discussion

Why is focus so difficult? Why is it so hard to slow down to speed up? Why are
these teams making unsound decisions?

  1. **Cost of Delay.** Notice how we used Cost of Delay to expose the folly of splitting work across two projects in Exhibit 1, and two shared projects in the case of Exhibit 2. Without an Apples-to-Apples way to prioritize work, this insight would be impossible. Cost of Delay allows us to make smart prioritization decisions when combined with a rough sense of initiative duration.  
**To Do**: Start estimate cost of delay and prioritizing with CD3 ([see here](http://blackswanfarming.com/cost-of-delay-divided-by-duration/)).
  2. **Invisible Work**. In my examples, all of the work is visible. That is rarely the case and this is a thorny topic for teams. Exposing “ticket duty” and unplanned work to the world can feel embarrassing. In some cases they’ve asked for the leeway to work down the debt, and have been denied. Or they’re dependent on another team to unblock them, and the help never arrives. Or worse still they don’t want the PM to shoot down their work (even when they know it is necessary). So they battle the unplanned work in secret. I talk more about this in my [Ops Death Spiral post](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/learned-helplessness-and-the-ops-death-spiral-b0fff7d916b1). Teams doing Scrum are not immune to this.  
**To Do**: Make it safe enough to visualize all work. Engage the team, and explain the upside.
  3. **Task Switching**. We chronically underestimate the impact of task-switching (both in our personal lives, and our work lives). Imagine a day that starts at 9AM. Emails. At 9:30 there’s a half an hour standup. After some interruptions, you’re able to get an hour of focused work in before lunch. From 1pm to 3pm you’re stuck in meetings. More unplanned work. And finally from 4pm-5pm you get to crank on a story. Consider the cost of getting started after each interruption. Folks in the trenches frequently talk about “days that get away”.  
**To Do**: Limit work-in-progress (WIP). Block uninterrupted time.
  4. **Staying busy**. We are naturally geared to keep busy. When something is blocked, we are programmed to pick up the next task. Product Managers constantly ask “can we parallelize this?” The thought of someone having nothing to do — or god forbid coaching another team member, or knocking out some tiny UX debt tasks — is deeply troubling. High Utilization is dangerous.  
**To Do**: It can be difficult and unreasonable to limit utilization, but the same effect can be achieved by implemented conservative WIP and watching queues.
  5. **Teams just need more discipline**. It is tempting to attribute long lead times to a lack of team discipline. So more process is introduced (thereby increasing planning time). You can see from these examples that the problem is one of multi-tasking and unmanaged complexing. Ideally you’re measuring lead times — the time from initiative conception to actually delivered the expected value to customers — so you’ll be able to get an early indicator of when more resources (or more focus) may be needed. But even then … the tendency is to ascribe delays to team behavior/discipline, and not the system.  
**To Do**: Make work visible and be honest about resource allocation. Demonstrate the team is working hard, but is struggling with multiple tasks.
  6. **The need to please.** You’d think that optimizing for the company’s economic well-being would be priority #1. But it isn’t. Managers and teams want to be helpful, and add all sorts of dependencies and constraints that need not exist. Leaders want to claim they’re firing on all cylinders and moving on all of their promises. Maybe Team B promised Team A that they’d get started in Q3 (before Initiative 2 hit the scene). Team A may literally be idle without Team B’s help, and no one likes an idle team.  
**To Do**: Hmmm. Frame things in economic terms and commit to the global economic outcomes?
  7. **Uncomfortable decisions**. Note the number of tough discussions baked into those examples. We tend to shy away from the tough conversations, or jump in trying to defend our turf to the detriment of identifying the best way forward.   
**To Do**: Read the book [Crucial Conversations](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Second/dp/1469266822). Use Cost of Delay to keep things grounded in economics.

That’s it. Nothing earth shattering.

**We were aligned last week. And now we are not. What gives?**  
Correct. Building shared understanding is hard. And fleeting. You have to keep
at it.

**Why are the on-boarding docs in Confluence out of date?**  
Because building shared understanding is hard. It takes work. If we can’t keep
them updated maybe they are not important. Do you care?

**Do we really need another whiteboard session?**  
Yes. Building shared understanding is hard. It takes time.

**Why do we keep having to revisit the mission goals?**  
Because building shared understanding is hard. Especially when we’re gathering
new learnings and information.

**Why didn’t they thoroughly read my Slack message?  
**Because Slack is a fire-hose. Building shared understanding is hard. Go for a walk and figure it out. Or advocate for a team agreement to read and comment on important Slack messages.

**The team is super busy. But we can’t seem to get anything done!**  
Right. Because the stuff that matters requires shared understanding. And
building shared understanding is hard. When we sidestep the hard work, we end
up doing the less consequential work.

**I can get so much done alone. People just slow me down.**  
There are certainly times for that. But if a team of five is to operate as a
team (and not five teams of one each), then you have to build shared
understanding. And that’s hard.

**Can we just write our standup updates in Slack each day?**  
Conversations are important. Building shared understanding takes cadence,
adding new information, and confirming our understanding. Can you do that in
Slack? Give it a try…

**What’s up with all the stickies? Can we get back to work?**  
Sure. Just make sure you are walking out of the meeting for the right reasons
and not because building shared understanding is hard.

**I can’t get through to people.**  
Yup. Building shared understanding is hard.

**No one understands me.**  
I can relate. It’s hard. Start trying to build bridges. Build shared
understanding.

**Why isn’t that [shared artifact] enough?**  
____ is Hard. You may need more artifacts. Or more pairing on artifacts, and
then throw them away once you’ve built shared understanding and captured that
shared understanding in code and a usable product.

**But …**  
Building shared understanding is hard.

**…**  
Hard

### Chalk Talk: Mapping the Why, Assumptions, and Solutions

#### Video and Transcript

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*ZOcpMYUhWtzDqqaTjQ2f0A.png)

One of the central roles of a product manager is to drive shared
understanding. With shared understanding, a team is more effective, resilient,
and creative. Alignment without shared understanding is temporary and short-
lived. The best teams find a way to break down complexity and speak the same
language. They row relentlessly in the right direction, even when that point
on the horizon shifts.

In my chalk talk, I share a framework for building shared understanding with
your team and other stakeholders. You can either watch my chalk talk or read
the transcript below. Enjoy!

### Transcript …

### The Problem: Context is Always Changing

We all know that one of the big challenges of product management is sharing
context. You don’t only have to share it with your team, or across your team,
but you also have to share it across the entire organization. You’re basically
sharing context all the time. And the challenge is that the context is always
changing. The context of yesterday is not the context of today.

In my chalk talk, I’m going to frame that problem, and give you some
strategies to make sure that the context you share is the most current
context, and is deep enough for your teams to be able to take action.

### Direction vs. Destination

Think about some of the words that we use, and think about how we communicate
strategy as product managers. Let’s say you’ve got a horizon, and you’re in a
boat. Now for a lot of knowledge work, you’re just generally sailing west,
like Columbus. You’re sailing to a point on the horizon. You’re going
somewhere. That’s a direction.

Now think about how people frequently state goals. They state a series of
unique points along a line, that you need to be able to hit in order to get to
a specific endpoint. And that’s what we call a destination. Think about those
two words: One is _direction_, and that’s a lot more applicable to knowledge
work, and the other is a very linear, deterministic goal that you’re trying to
hit. Direction versus destination.

Let’s take a real-life situation: You have a friend and they say, “I want to
lose five pounds.” You have another friend that says, “I want to eat healthy.”
Those are two different perspectives. One is a destination-based perspective
(“I want to lose five pounds”). And the other one is a more systems-based
perspective (“I want to eat healthy”).

Now, we all know there are many unhealthy ways that you could lose five
pounds. The idea is by eating healthy, one of the things we might notice is
losing weight. But we might also live longer, we might be happier, and we
might be less stressed. So that’s more of a systems approach.

Now, the third example is this idea of cascading goals. Dividing one goal into
a sub-goal, into many sub-sub-goals, into many sub-sub-sub-goals, into sub-
sub-sub-sub-sub-goals. We see this in practices like OKRs, or management by
objectives.

The idea is that everything cascades up and connects with a higher level goal.
Teams are told to focus on their individual goal. Now, that might be good in
some situations. But in a lot of the environments that we’re working in, the
teams that are on the front lines actually need to be able to see the big
picture. They need to do this so that they can take course corrections as
they’re moving along. Think about a person who’s working right there [points
at lower level goal]. If they know that’s the goal and they see the context
changing, what if they could circumvent all these steps and just achieve that
goal in another way? What if the context changes for this goal, or if they
could take a shortcut?

I tried to lay these out here as we’re understanding the problem. You have
destinations versus directions. You have goals versus systems. And then you
have the need for teams to be able to see the big picture in knowledge work to
make sure that they can take the course corrections necessary to move in the
right direction.

### The Reality: Context is a Moving Target

But the reality in product management is, we’ll do a kickoff, and at that
point, shared understanding is at an all-time high. Or we _think_ it’s at a
high. But over time, we’re always fighting the downward pressure on shared
understanding.

The context is changing. And at the same time, we’re learning, and we’re
improving our shared understanding. We might be iterating and getting more
shared understanding. It’s always this push and pull on what we’re learning
and the degree to which our learning is depreciating that really dictates the
situation.

That’s one problem. We’re always losing shared understanding and gaining
shared understanding. And even when we have a new, better, shared
understanding, we still have trouble communicating that.

A second reality is that different people on your team have different needs.
You might have someone who is more junior, who’s new at this, who may just not
care all that much about the big picture, and they’re looking down here [draws
line downward]. They’re looking for things right in front of them: “Can you
tell me what needs to be done next, please, so that I can do my job?”

Meanwhile, you have the people who are asking why all the time and the people
who need to understand the big picture. And these sometimes are your most
valuable employees. They want to understand the big picture, how things are
fitting together, and how things relate to each other. You’ve got both of
these personalities on your teams.

And the third part of the reality is, the problem-solution dichotomy that
everyone talks about, where we’ll specify the problem and you specify the
solution, is a lot more intricate than that. Because every problem has a
solution to some higher-level problem. Even something like hitting quarterly
goals, or a new round of funding, that’s a solution towards maybe reaching a
higher-level goal for your company. When people are talking about problems and
solutions, it’s a lot more complicated than that.

Talk to an engineer for example, even the slightest interface change is a
problem to solve. You have nested problems and solutions and people with
different needs. And you have the fact that shared understanding is always in
a dynamic state, and you’re always having to communicate it.

### The Solution: Mapping Context

I’ve found the following technique to be an extremely helpful tool to help you
get your own head straight about things, and for communicating context to your
team. I also recommend doing this exercise with your team. It’s a great way to
develop a shared vocabulary.

And this is an issue with roadmaps as well; it’s really about having a
conversation. It’s really about sharing the same vocabulary and having the
conversation that yields the best results. Let me show you this method for
mind mapping.

### 1\. A Fuzzy Goal

You start with some fuzzy goal. And fuzzy goals like we’re talking about
aren’t the most prescriptive goals, and they’re not the big pie-in-the-sky
goals. They’re something that is actionable and directional.

### 2\. Because, We Know, And We Assume

Now, everyone wants to know the why. Why are we trying this? Why are we doing
this? To answer this question, we use the word _because_. Everyone can relate
to the word because. And we throw on two other phrases: ‘we know’, and ‘we
assume’. And this is absolutely essential. How many times have you gotten two
months into a project, and someone says, ‘why are we doing this’? And someone
said, ‘well, I guess we assumed that this was true’. And the person says, I
know that’s not true. So by saying this, we know and we assume, you really
make it clear why you’re doing it, and what’s the underlying rationale.

### 3\. While And Without

And the next two words are ‘while’ and ‘without’. This can be a little tricky
to wrap your head around. In your quest to achieve this fuzzy goal, what are
the boundaries? What resources are you playing with? A great example that I
can think about is that you’re doing something that might potentially damage
the user experience. You might want to create a boundary there. You know what?
No matter what we do in our effort to try to improve this fuzzy goal, we don’t
want to mess up the user experience. So we use these words, ‘while’ and
‘without’. And I’ll give you an example of all of this together in a bit.

### 4\. By Trying

And then finally, we have what people commonly call solutions, but I just call
it ‘by trying’. We’re going to try something to attempt to move this fuzzy
goal. But the most important point here is that you can nest these. And by
nesting, you can start having another ‘because’ for this, and another ‘while’
or ‘without’, and another ‘by trying’.

### 5\. Example

Let me give you an example that everyone can relate to, something like eating
healthy.

_Because_ we know that eating healthy might help you live longer. Maybe that’s
an assumption, but I think commonly, people know that. And we _assume_ that
our relationship might be better if we eat healthy and we’re less stressed
out. _Because_ we _assume_ that eating healthy reduces stress.

We’ll do this _without_ breaking the bank. We’ll _try_ to eat healthy, but you
know, we’ve got a budget. And we’ll do this _while_ making sure that, we have
fun sometimes. We’re going to go out and eat with our friends.

And we’re going to do this _by trying_ what? We’re going to do this _by
trying_ to cook in six nights a week. _Because_ we think that by cooking in
six nights a week, just by the nature of cooking in, we’re going to eat
healthier. We’re going to do that _without_ annoying our kids, _because_ they
watch TV at a certain time. And then we’re going to do that _by trying_ to
have a set menu ahead of time that we shop for at Whole Foods, for example.

What you see here is that if you can start to state your goals this way,
instead of just having a big cascade of goals that just say things like ‘meet
this revenue goal’, ‘or ‘this is this metric’, or this is this other aspect of
your goal’ you’re explaining your rationale.

What I would like to encourage you to do is to try this mind mapping method as
a way to just get your heads straight before jumping into a roadmap or another
strategic document.

### In Summary: Resist Prescriptive Goals

First we talked about the difference between a destination and a direction, or
systems and goals. And next we talked about the challenges of shared
understanding. That we’re always trying to grow shared understanding, but it’s
always degrading, too. There’s always that dynamic happening.

And then, I talked about a mind mapping method to help you develop a common
vocabulary. And that conversation is critical because if you have that
conversation, you can constantly get context.

When you think about it from a product manager’s point of view, it is always
tempting to have prescriptive goals. That is a temptation that always exists.
And If you take a step back, that is too fragile for most knowledge work. If
you just create those destinations that people must hit, then the context
changes, they’re not going to be able to change course. You’re going to lose
that shared understanding very quickly.

What I’d like you to do is to think about direction instead of destination as
you’re putting together your roadmaps. Make sure that you’re communicating the
why, the data that you have behind that, the boundaries that you’ve created
around your particular goal, and also encourage people to try new things.

Maybe one thing won’t work, but if they can understand what your rationale is
in your thought process, then they might creatively come up with other
solutions that might achieve that goal even faster.

### I Need To Fix This

_Note: This post isn’t my normal tech/product fare, although it does relate to
work. It talks about growing up with addiction, and later that transferring to
work situations. I’ll be back to tech/product in the next post. Hang tight._

At age eight, I wrote [working
agreements](https://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/working-agreements-
defined.pdf) for my family. I wanted the fighting (and drinking) to stop. My
contract — written in loopy cursive, dull pencil, and red ink underline — is
packed away somewhere in a Neiman Marcus Christmas sweater box near the
mothballs. Every couple years, I’ll stumble across it while looking for the
happy-looking photos, of which there are plenty. These situations aren’t
binary and clearcut. Wonderfully loving people can do self-destructive things.
And things can, and do, improve.

As a certain brand of [adult
child](http://www.michaelsamsel.com/Content/Individuals/adult_child_syndrome.html),
you hold a core belief — fantasy, almost — that if everyone can just get on
the same page you’ll be OK.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Utx8yUk_bDIIliF1A-UoKQ.png)

There’s hypervigilance and overthinking. At work, you pick up on shifts in the
flow of energy, the turning tide, the disappointed coworker, the elephant in
the room, and the snarl of politics. You develop a keen sense of “the system”,
and tend not to blame individuals (because individuals are good, of course,
but do bad things). You need, on some level, a battle to fight, or — as a
teacher once told me — a wolf behind every tree. Perhaps this is why adult
children often gravitate to the helping professions.

> **Overthinking Things**. Adult children start thinking ‘too early’ because
they are not able to proceed in early life by _‘going-on-being’_ Often they
are precocious intellectually and this leads to intellectual attainment that
is valuable as an adult. However there is a tendency to misuse cognition to
try to sort out matters of emotion or preference
([source](http://www.michaelsamsel.com/Content/Individuals/adult_child_syndrome.html))

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*e9IJuPOAi5Qh0_lFvm24ZA.png)

These traits are rewarded and prove to be valuable in some contexts, but also
come at a deep cost. Work environments can be particularly challenging.

We are in our element when there is tension, a nut to crack, and a system to
unravel. “If only _________ could see how much this is impacting others!” “Why
can’t other people see what I see?” “I have to cover all of the angles!” “This
all flows down from THAT dysfunction!” I remember putting small bits of tape
(and later pen marks) on wine bottles hoping that I could “prove” that
something was wrong, and then everything would be better.

Ironically, what can appear as externally focused — helping others, fighting
for others, bringing peace, empowering people— is itself an act of self-
preservation. “Fixing” feels safe, but you get so focused on fixing, that you
don’t notice the progress you’re making, or whether you actually feel good!

> **Excessive Altruism** This is often vicarious nurturing. The adult child
does for others what he or she down deep wants to receive. It usually leads,
however, to self-impoverishment (which puts a de facto ceiling on how much
others really could be helped anyway)
([source](http://www.michaelsamsel.com/Content/Individuals/adult_child_syndrome.html))

Cognitive dissonance and coherence issues appear in almost all companies.
There’s almost _always _some baggage there…just like any family. I don’t think
“all companies are fucked up”, but I think they’re always working through some
sort of challenge (hopefully with some degree of psychological safety).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_WyVOoaKFO60jjNqz9ys4A.png)

At the water cooler you’ll find coworkers who _look and sound _frustrated. And
they are _at that moment._ But you have to remember that they aren’t
internalizing the information like you may be internalizing the information.
They’re likely playing a longer game…a game you find difficult to play because
you’re not used to sustained happy endings. They _expect _healthy outcomes. If
it gets to be too much, they’ll hit healthy limits and leave. They’re not
bringing home the angst. So as much as you might want to help and champion the
cause (deep down, _your_ cause)…you have to remember _your_ core needs.

The same goes with leaders and managers. Trust me, I’ve been that guy writing
the “shit is fucked up, we need to fix it” email to bosses and CEOs. In many
cases I’ve been rewarded for that — the guy who calls it like it is, and
doesn’t sugar coat. One even said:

> I like having you around because you challenge things. You’re the only
person willing to challenge me. You make me think. But how are you? Are you
happy?

Bless that guy. Smooth as silk, while the castle was burning!

The personal toll can be large. Burnout and workaholism are a real threat.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*C9fE6clKqGjCgp9bGWXnOQ.png)

I’m not an expert in this (obviously). I’m talking about my experiences, which
may not be like your experiences. I just wanted to share a bit and encourage
others to share. Doing so has helped me. I’ve benefited from support groups,
reading, meditation, and the support of my family and significant other. I’ve
come to grips with the fact that some of this “legacy code” is pretty damn
effective for certain tasks. And that occasionally I need to do some
refactoring. Gotta get some product dev in there :)

So, excuse the cliche, but know there are other people out there who might
share your experiences. To truly help others, we need to help and protect
ourselves.

### 40 Twitter Doodles, Lists, and Diagrams

In prepping for a future [Medium](https://medium.com/u/504c7870fdb6) post, I
found myself culling through old tweets. I enjoy doodling, listicles, and
diagrams. And I like The Twitter.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nsxfB9NVDfF0aMcOogWMiA.jpeg)

Occasionally these drawings and lists end up as
[Medium](https://medium.com/u/504c7870fdb6) posts, but most often they stay
tweets. I’ve shared a couple below that caught the attention of the software-
product-nerd-o-sphere.

I view Twitter as a wonderful constraint. One tweet, one image. Which means
that a lot is left unsaid, and misunderstandings are common. So take it all
with a grain of vague-salt.

### Project Team vs. Product Team

In this diagram, I try to work out some of the differences between a more
narrowly focused project team, and a more broadly focused product team.

Projects _can_ be outcome, and benefits focused (not just output focused).
[Benefits realization is a
thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefits_realisation_management). A
product team embarks on initiatives, and makes bets and investments (aka
Projects). At least in theory, project/program/portfolio governance cares
about expected benefits AND actual benefits. So, I dunno, I’m not irked by the
word project.

I frequently encounter debates about Projects (and estimates). When you step
back, you see it really doesn’t have much to do with the word Project (which
is rather open and malleable). Rather, you see that it is about scope of
responsibility, who does what, and who decides what. That’s what I wanted to
dig into here.

### Devs! Don’t Outsource Continuous Improvement!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jsqcwnau087Qmd8oBhnmHA.png)

Here’s some advice to developers. Take continuous improvement into your own
hands. Don’t rely on a manager or a Scrum Master. Take pride in doing it
right.

Visualize your work. Measure lead times. Be disciplined in your retros.
Surface impediments and blockers. Measure defects that get through to
production. Call out areas where you need additional expertise. Get deeply
involved in hiring. Keep track of how much [flow
time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29) you experience as a
team. Write run-books. Do RCA when applicable. Don’t toss things over the wall
to another group. Do lunch and learns for other developers in your org. Do
diligent group code reviews. Consider practices like mobbing and pairing. Hold
effective meetings. Continuously refactor. Go to conferences together.

Own it. Don’t outsource it.

Push folks like me (PMs) to show you data for the work you’ve finished. Agree
to meet with customers. Take an interest.

If you do all this, and your organization can’t…

  * remove blockers
  * resource the effort accordingly
  * let you practice your craft
  * overburdens you with work (keeps you busy)
  * disrespects you
  * asks you to cut corners that make no economic sense

…then leave. That’s it. Not worth your time. You’re a pro and you deserve
better.

All too often teams and management play a little dance. There’s a trust issue.
So the teams resist continuous improvement (because it always flops).
Management ups the process because there’s a lack of discipline and trust.
Process is used to “prove whether the team is doing its best”. All the wind
for any meaningful change is taken out of the team’s sails.

You end up with a weird bad parent / rebellious child syndrome.

At some point, someone has to try to break the cycle. Let that be you.


# So You Want Predictability…?

In fiction: we find the predictable boring. In real life: we find the
unpredictable terrifying. ― Mokokoma Mokhonoana

### So You Want Predictability…?

> In fiction: we find the predictable boring. In real life: we find the
unpredictable terrifying. ― Mokokoma Mokhonoana

I’ve been thinking lately about the word _predictability_.

Individual teams often have very little control over their ability to generate
_predictability_. Predictability is a function of the team, the work, and the
system surrounding the team. If work at a particular organization has an
average flow efficiency of 20% (values typically range between 10% and 40%),
then the team could go 2x over their estimate, and the lead time would
increase by only .2x. Predictability is gained through perseverance, and a
strong culture of continuous improvement EVERYWHERE.

Now… a stakeholder might say “despite these factors, all we ask is for you to
do your part! Given all of these headwinds, just let us know when you’ll be
done!” Hmmm. OK then, I’ll just bundle up all of the variability and drag,
double the lead time, and give you a mediocre, but achievable target. Good for
me (and maybe you), but bad for the business.

To prepare you for your next predictability conversation, I have prepared this
handy list. I’m sure they’ll understand.

_Note: Joke aside, I do believe it is the job of the team to quantify these
impacts in a disciplined way._

* * *

Dear ____________ . I 100% respect your need for predictability. I’d like
predictability as well! Predictability is a two way street. My team needs
discipline, craft, and passion. That’s a given. But to get to that elusive
level of predictability, we’ll also need you to….

  * Let us focus 100% on the effort
  * Colocate everyone (the capital “T” Team). Remove all dependencies
  * Give us the tools we need, and provision consistent environments
  * Allow us to pick the right tools for the challenge at hand
  * Establish a psychologically safe environment for the team
  * Provide instant and direct access to customers for research/validation
  * Provide access to meaningful data and insights
  * Begin the measure of predictability _after_ technical debt work-down
  * Begin the measure of predictability _after_ we have improve test coverage
  * Let us hire people who have solved this _exact _problem in a _perfectly similar_ context (technology, competitive, organizational)
  * Give us control over who we hire, and don’t constrain hiring by forcing us to fill requisitions prematurely with subpar talent
  * Let us use the software development methodology that suits us, and ideally let us complete similar efforts and collect data
  * Make meeting rooms and soundproof rooms available at all times
  * Remove all approval/review steps, or make those resources instantly available to the team whenever required
  * Give the team time to get to know each other, and establish trust
  * Remove all extraneous, non-value-add processes
  * Eliminate any managerial sub-optimization, politics, and bureaucracy
  * In lieu of all this, we’ll do what we can on our end. We’ll do our best

### 42 Things Non-Front-Liners Misunderstand

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*hilXTtHO1RQm5DxY.png)

It is unfair to expect people who haven’t worked on the front lines in
software development to _just get it_. Just as, I’m guessing, it is hard for
developers and UXers to grok sales and marketing, being a CEO, and working in
HR. Assuming malice is a big mistake. We all want great outcomes for our
respective businesses, but have a hard time bridging the divide.

I’ve offered up 40 or so based on my conversations with developers, designers,
UXers, data scientists, customer support, and product managers. Of course …
“it depends”, and none of these apply everywhere.

#### **Please add more!**

* * *

### **Non-Front-Liners routinely …**

  1. **Underestimate** the cost of multitasking and context switching
  2. **Underestimate** the cost of increasing complexity (adding use-cases, capabilities, etc.)
  3. **Underestimate** the benefits of regular refactoring, investing in tooling, and allocating time for unstructured research/experimentation
  4. **Underestimate** the investment required to build (and maintain) a meaningful level of shared understanding
  5. **Underestimate** the value of iterating immediately (not months later) based on actual customer usage and feedback
  6. **Overestimate** the value of “divide and conquer” models whereby individual teams have limited contact with other teams that are contributing to the same initiative
  7. **Overestimate** the value of having managers/proxies communicate between teams (vs. having the teams communicate directly)
  8. **Overestimate** the value of centralizing/sharing certain functions (e.g. QA, DevOps, UX)
  9. **Underestimate** the value of committing later to work (e.g. acting on new information, not pre-committing resources)
  10. **Underestimate** the value of more unstructured hacking/spiking to fully grasp the magnitude of a new challenge
  11. **Underestimate** the cost of isolating individual team members on distinct “projects” to boost utilization rates (vs. having more slack time, and focusing on fewer initiatives)
  12. Underestimate the cost of having single architects who “decide everything” in isolation, thereby removing front-liners from the decision making process
  13. **Overestimate** the value of segregating front end and back end developers
  14. **Overestimate** the value of using artificial deadlines to motivate employees
  15. **Underestimate** the cost of leaving known bugs/defects active in product
  16. **Overestimate** the value of extensive pre-planning without individual contributors (the people who will do the work) present
  17. **Underestimate** the value of spending time “away from keyboards” (e.g. visiting customers, team white-boarding, etc.)
  18. **Underestimate** the cost of preventing developers from using their tools of choice. The flip-side might be overestimating the value of consistency in tool selection.
  19. **Overestimate** the ability for customers to describe what they need, and what they might find valuable
  20. **Underestimate** the value of connecting new developer hires with the broader business context (e.g. invite them to sales calls, the customer support queue, etc.)
  21. **Underestimate** the cost of becoming emotionally attached to high-fidelity mock-ups
  22. **Underestimate** the value of unbiased coaching and facilitation
  23. **Underestimate** the value of co-location and underestimating the cost of mixed-location (having some people co-located, but others remote)
  24. **Overestimate** the value of adding process when an environment features low trust/low safety
  25. **Overestimate** the value of having experience in a specific language/domain (of course, sometimes this is very valid)
  26. **Underestimate** the value of working horizontally across a problem space (vs. going deep component by component)
  27. **Underestimate** the value of live pattern libraries
  28. **Underestimate** the cost of celebrating silver bullets when the work required corner cutting and is obviously “for show”. **Overestimate** the value of success theater
  29. **Underestimate** the value of giving a team autonomy over its work environment and providing dedicated spaces to meet/work
  30. **Underestimate** the cost of having a system that is too complicated for any one person to understand/explain
  31. **Overestimate** the value of measuring a team solely based on story point velocity
  32. **Underestimate** the interest developers have in understanding the business/customer problem (and the value that might afford to the company)
  33. **Overestimate** the value of addressing team conflict via 1:1s (vs. coaching the team to resolve its issues publicly)
  34. **Overestimate** the ability for a single product manager to correctly predict the future
  35. **Underestimate** the value of connecting work to high-level business outcomes
  36. **Underestimate** the cost of having inconsistent environments for QA, Staging, etc.
  37. **Underestimate** the cumulative drag created by a “brilliant” executive who exhibits toxic behavior. Underestimate the costs required to insulate that behavior from the rest of the organization (and the efficacy of those efforts)
  38. **Underestimate** the degree to which certain incentive structures can create conflict between team members
  39. **Underestimate** the cost of coherence issues (e.g. actions running counter to stated company culture or goals)
  40. **Underestimate** the value of divergence early in an initiative. Our tendency is to prematurely converge and “get moving”
  41. **Underestimate** the cost of making individual promises to customers around compliance and security (vs. global policies)
  42. **Overestimate** the degree to which developer “touch time” impacts the total lead time for initiatives (a value of 40% is good, 10–15% typical)

Here’s what would be awesome… if together we could amass a compendium of
“**things Non-Front-Liners routinely underestimate and overestimate when
thinking about software product development**”. I think this format works, and
would help us stay consistent:

  * Underestimate the cost of ____________________
  * Overestimate the value of __________________

My goal here isn’t to rant, but rather to build bridges and shared
understanding. Let’s keep comments short and concise, with a focus on benefits
to the business.


# 12 Bottom-Up Change Hints

Email is a terrible way to advocate for change. Too much can go wrong.

* * *

### 12 Bottom-Up Change Hints

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*K5CYeh-Ou6OB5QttCHGhwg.jpeg)

Sometimes you need to wear rose colored glasses ….

  1. Email is a terrible way to advocate for change. Too much can go wrong.
  2. Don’t assume that someone who complains about something in private, is prepared to advocate for change in public. Pick your agitators wisely.
  3. Craft the change you want in terms accessible to the business. How will this improve/create business outcomes? This is a no-brainer, but I always amaze myself by how often I leave out the Why, and connect that to my proposed How/What/Who. I assume the connection is self-evident.
  4. Remember that the system is perfectly optimized for _something_. That something may be the perfect balance of two opposing agendas. It is tempting to identify that tension as instability (and a situation ripe for disruption), but the butting of heads can be perfectly predictable, and intractable. Put another way, don’t assume discord equates to an opportunity for change, and don’t assume “this makes no sense” means it truly makes no sense. Also, realize that a single goal — a promise to grow at a certain rate, for example — can obliterate and overshadow all other needs. Nothing else is important, even when people say it is. Ask yourself … what is this system truly optimized for?
  5. Be prepared to leave. Some things aren’t worth fixing. And some things are fixable in ways that will be dissatisfying to you personally. Speaking for your own needs can be far more powerful than “speaking for” others.
  6. Understand that 95% of all conversations with executives involve someone 1) complaining about someone/something, and/or 2) advocating for a pet project and asking for resources. Advocating for bottom-up continuous improvement is problematic because it implicitly suggests 1) something is broken, and 2) you are advocating for a scary and unpredictable “way” involving empowering the plebeians and cutting out managers. It feels non-actionable …the typical reply is “I want solutions, goddammit, not problems!” As an alternative, don’t ask for permission. Say “we’re trying [some thing] to see if [some outcome], and we’ll measure success by [some benefit].”
  7. Go as high up the ladder as possible, but keep it brief. In line with the point above, understand that most senior executives are sick and tired of the political mayhem below them (even when they are the key reason it exists). They’re just waiting for someone to speak straight with them (even when their response to straight talk is to crush it into oblivion). Use this to your advantage, and make it count. Give them a back channel to what is “really happening” without overwhelming them or coming off as overly vested.
  8. Remember that executives are being peppered with new/shiny “ways” 24–7. Why aren’t we doing [some fancy way]? This 1) implies the company is behind the times, and 2) implies that you think that by merely adopting a “way”, everything will be OK. Execs hate the idea that similar companies are absolutely kicking their ass by adopting simple practices (and creating the trust/safety to try new things). So…de-buzz-word everything. Don’t mention that Google has had success ___________________.
  9. Realize that you will be accused of trying to “convert” people. It is critical to let a movement build steam organically and to avoid becoming a figurehead. Distributed and decentralized works best.
  10. Keep in mind that any given time there are various leader/manager change initiatives in the works. In fact, you could argue that the status quo is a function of competing change initiatives. Bottom-up change initiatives compete with the established “long games” played by executives, and are therefore viewed as a threat/distraction. The desire to take credit for change, and to cast change in one’s particular image, is somewhat universal…and very common among executives (to the point of sacrificing overarching business objectives). As a start, map who is trying what (and why), and realize that you’ll likely need _someone _to perceive gain/advantage by supporting you, or, at a minimum, by not stopping you. Also, be honest with yourself. Are you advocating for change selfishly, or would you be happy if an expected behavior emerged?
  11. As an extension of #10, respect the degree to which execs fashion a professional self-image that REQUIRES them to come up with this stuff. This — these big bold changes — are why they are there … not stuff a bunch of front-liners can do by regularly inspecting/adapting. Tread lightly. Your motive might be to improve the working conditions of our fellow contributors. But your whole career doesn’t hinge on the perception of control.
  12. Make something work on a small scale. It’s easier, and will play to the universal desire for “good news” and “bright spots”.

### **B2B SaaS Service Ecosystem Cheat Sheet**

To facilitate some training, I wrote up this quick cheat sheet of terms used
in service ecosystems (where B2B SaaS products play). I have a PDF of this
[here](https://goo.gl/ypZoLJ) . Feel free to share, but please keep the
attribution (to me) on the doc. That way I’ll be liable for the spelling
mistakes, not you.

_Note: I wish I had time to make a fancy infographic or animated movie thing.
Maybe later._

* * *

**CAPABILITIES** allow human **ACTORS** to achieve **OUTCOMES** (that produce **BENEFITS**). Actors frequently have relationships with other actors. Outcomes and benefits are sometimes referred to as **GOALS**, which importantly can have functional, motivational, emotional, and social dimensions. **VALUE** can be stated as a ratio of benefits to cost.

To achieve outcomes, actors access **TOUCHPOINTS**, and interact** **with
**INTERFACES** within those touchpoints. Repeated** INTERACTIONS** are often
known as **WORKFLOWS**. Workflows can span multiple touchpoints/interfaces.
Touchpoints are sometimes referred to as **CHANNELS**.

Typically — in business software — actors actively (or passively) create,
read, update, and delete **ENTITIES**. Think of entities — users, work orders,
pageviews, companies — as nouns (and interactions as verbs). Entities contain
**CONTENT** and **INFORMATION**. Importantly, entities may mean different
things in different **CONTEXTS** (a specific actor, desired benefit,
touchpoint, etc.) and have **ENTITY RELATIONSHIPS**. **BUSINESS LOGIC**
prescribes how entities interact with one another.

All **SERVICE DELIVERY** efforts can be mapped to actors and their desired
benefits. Elements of service delivery can be visible to users (e.g.
interface, customer service) or invisible (e.g. backend technology,
monitoring, HR).

Some **SKILLS** (also capabilities)** **are applicable narrowly to specific
actors, interfaces. etc. Other skills — like accessibility, HR, performance,
fraud prevention — span actors, desired outcomes, and interfaces. To reiterate
… _everything _contributes to delivering value to customer actors, but some
things happen to be closer to the customer. The Coffee Maker maps to customer
value. Stop doing stuff that doesn’t!

**PROJECTS** are temporary endeavors to optimize and/or expand the **CAPABILITY OFFERING**. **FEATURES** are temporary solutions to offering specific capabilities. The service delivery mechanism often changes with time. Actors may base buying decisions on advertised features, but in SaaS the long term value of the offering is contingent on the ability to continuously generate outcomes and benefits (also known as **BENEFIT REALIZATION**). Unlike wrapped software products, SaaS **PRODUCTS **— given their mutable nature — function more like capability offering packages. SaaS is predominantly a **SERVICE ECOSYSTEM**.

By producing **VALUE** for Actors, and through effective **PACKAGING** and
**ENABLEMENT** (delivered by internal actors and capabilities) an organization
ostensibly makes **MONEY **(a **BUSINESS OUTCOME**)**.**

# They Don’t Understand a Word You’re Saying

Shared understanding is hard Part 2

### They Don’t Understand a Word You’re Saying

#### Shared understanding is hard Part 2

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*EeUENC3vGpe8Umrh0Dvwhw.jpeg)

Doodling …. DO YOU HEAR ME!!!!

Here is a a retro format that I have used over the years…

> Today we are going to explore the idea of shared understanding. Please take
a couple minutes to brainstorm words that are used with the best intentions by
you or your fellow teammates, but that cause confusion, and make it difficult
to forge shared understanding.

Here are some of the words the a team generated recently:

> Better, Architecture, Review, Design, Milestone, Team, Product Vision,
Story, Epic, Bug, Engagement, Process, Healthy, Tech Lead, “Own this”, “Write
a Story”, Validate, Experiment, Deadline, Spike, Proof of Concept, Ops, “Do
Your Best”, Ownership, Accountability

Do your best? Really? But this output is _very normal_ for the exercise.

OK. Consider that these smart and talented people spend ~40hrs a week
together. Not all of that time is spent talking, but a good chunk is spent
interacting, Slacking, and socializing. Most of these words are used in
regular meetings. How could such relatively pedestrian product development
words cause confusion and impact outcomes?

I’ve done this retro exercise many times. And I’m always surprised. What
happens after the team brainstorms these words? The first instinct is to write
a glossary. We need to work this out! We need a common vocabulary! Let’s chat
now! Who owns what words? Write a Confluence page!

But then it dawns on people that some of these concepts are a moving target.
It isn’t the words themselves — they all have reasonable Google-able
definitions — but rather about the varied (and shifting) context. After the
retro, I print the output of the exercise as a reminder that you can’t assume
people know what you mean. Shared understanding is HARD. You need to WORK at
it. No one is going to read/remember that Confluence page (let alone
understand it even if you do write it).

You need repetition, experience, conversation, interaction, reformulation,
iteration, STORIES, drawing, coffee, mind maps, wins, trust … and even then
it’s frickin’ hard. Here today, gone tomorrow. Entropy FTW.

Step back even further. Consider VPs who meet certain team members for an hour
a month. Or those “super important” high-level 1hr meetings where everyone is
nodding and saying “great idea” … but then all the attendees march off and
inadvertently sabotage each other? Makes complete sense. If the folks spending
most of their working life together need to work so hard to wrestle with
words…what might that mean for the managers, execs, CEOs, and partners?

> It’s not really a deadline. Just a guideline. I really need to see the team
step up. Acme is an important customer. We need to help them succeed.
Everybody should succeed, especially the team players. Try to write up a quick
overview by next week, along with a status check.

Consider how much can go wrong there.

My experience is that many organizations routinely push employees to their
absolute limit. It becomes a game of three dimensional chess you cannot win.
Teams short-change the hard work required to build shared understanding. The
organization rewards freneticism, velocity, and “stretch” goals. No one really
understands each other. And no one is present enough — amidst the stress and
adrenaline — to do the hard work of building shared understanding. Yet we plod
on, because we identify with the myth of the multi-tasking, “great
communicator” superhero.

Try the retro format and see what you come up with.

I truly believe that some percentage (&gt;60%?) of software development is
about leaving humans the room to build shared understanding continuously, work
on communication, and make the environment safe to have meaningful
conversations. Without making their heads explode. And without fooling
yourself there is a silver bullet.

# Present Bias, Constraints, and making 60 Things Possible

Note: Scroll down if you’re short on time, and want to get straight to the
list of goodness.

* * *

### Present Bias, Constraints, and making 60 Things Possible

**_Note: Scroll down if you’re short on time, and want to get straight to the list of goodness._**

Software product development is an optimization problem. Adding objectives,
constraints, and uncertainty to an optimization problem adds complexity. If
you’ve done this for a while, you know the constant push-pull between short
term gains and long term results.

> The present bias refers to the tendency of people to give stronger weight to
payoffs that are closer to the present time when considering trade-offs
between two future moments (O’Donoghue, &amp;, Rabin, 1999).

Put simply, people tend to want to get the reward today, but push the pain of
loss far into the future. ([source](http://blog.alphaarchitect.com/2014/05/22
/good-bad-want-now/#gs.nBwtQtc))

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lWMBrsm_7yduEJXQU8W04w.png)

A great example is building a feature to close a new customer. The money is
right in your face. You can feel it. If you build X, you will make $Y. It’s
easy to lose sight of the actual costs (including the opportunity cost).What
if you focused on something riskier, but more valuable? We tend to lose sight
of that option, which makes sense because thinking too far (or deeply) into
the future can have a paralyzing effect. The lion will eat you if it takes
that long.

Other examples relate to [organizational resiliency](https://hackernoon.com/40
-ways-to-invest-in-more-resilient-teams-c2ac7d008591). It can be tempting to
shoot for short-term gains (adding headcount quickly, adding layers of
hierarchy, siloing specializations for efficiency), without considering the
long term effects. In short…we add constraints and new objectives. Which makes
navigating the problem space more difficult. And entropy ensues.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uxVJLuLuZKiKIKHmxmNXhg.png)

I often run into orgs that are trying _so damn hard _(as hard as they can,
actually), but they can’t seem to generate any forward momentum. They’re
layering more and more process on the situation without any impact. They’re
chasing down a new symptom every quarter. But when you actually interview the
various actors, you learn how insanely constrained their world is. We’re not
talking about an inability to find a globally optimal solution. That would be
too ambitious. Rather, even mediocre ways forward are impossible, or require
mind-numbing 3 dimensional chess.

“Installing” Agile without removing constraints will fail.

Which brings me to a conversation I had with [Josh
Seiden](https://medium.com/u/7f786c230ca9) (Sense &amp; Respond, LeanUX) the
other day. Josh correctly pointed out that my post [42 Things Non-Front-Liners
Misunderstand](https://hackernoon.com/40-things-non-front-liners-
misunderstand-fcb2f55088f9) was basically preaching to the converted, and that
Non-Front-Liners just wouldn’t get it. If a Dev or UX sent this to an
executive, they’d get an “um”. His challenge — which will take me a while to
execute on — was to figure out how to elicit a “hmmm, I think I see what you
mean, I get it now, we should act on this!”

But how?

When you boil down many of the points in the 42 Things post, you end up at the
tension between short(er) and long(er) term thinking, and individual and group
intrinsic/extrinsic reward systems. Front-Liners, for example:

  * DO touch the product, the code, and the design
  * DON’T touch the sales quotas, revenue projections, and meetings with investors, lawyers, and analysts
  * DO bang their heads against tech-debt ridden code, feel the hit of multi-tasking, and cringe at “just shipping” crappy features
  * DON’T spend 60hrs per week in meetings where people are primarily 1) complaining and/or 2) pitching their pet projects
  * DO have to sit in close quarters with a small development team, and — according to the data — have to solve a cost/benefit design decision every 15 minutes with very intense cognitively challenging work
  * DON’T have the fate and livelihood of many hundred (or thousand) people in their hands. And have to be “good at PowerPoint” AND strategy
  * … and tend not to have to answer 30 support calls a day, send a hundred outbound sales emails, butt heads with vendors, and field calls from angry first-tier customers

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GlfiAGTJdAlEfo2TG7wTjA.png)

So there are different versions of “good job” happening, and different mental
models, cause/effect, and cost/reward. We respond to the present bias in
different ways because of how we think, and what we know.

How do you build shared understanding?

If you’re lucky, the CTO or CPO are able to explain and describe the calculus
to other senior leaders. If you’re even luckier, they are able to stand head
to head with the CRO, CFO, and CEO, and translate the calculus into an
actionable risk-management and continuous improvement framework. They’ll
explain why chasing efficiency begets rigidness, and that you need to care
about resiliency. They’ll explain why a lack of focus begets an exponential
increase in the number of constraints. Finally, they’ll explain why having a
tall org might not benefit the product. But that’s if you (and they) are
lucky.

Consider, then, that senior leaders _often_ don’t understand how certain
decisions will impact the future. They’re already too far away from the action
and no one has explained the calculus. People are running around talking about
UX, Agile, DevOps, leaving slack in the day, lowering utilization, and
Outcomes over Output…and someone without experience in the trenches (or
experience a long time ago) will not know WTF is going on.

> We put humans on the moon. And will send them to Mars. And you can’t fucking
ship a mobile app, and migrate to the new ERP system? That makes no sense! Is
anyone giving a damn here?

The constraints you are experiencing today are a culmination of many, many
decisions. At one point, you probably had a choice. And that is the central
challenge. We need to explain why these choices matter for the long term
success of your product development org. But don’t make them so sacred that
you never make any decisions — or respond to any changes.

That is OUR responsibility.

#### What if you could say? Why can’t you say?

In the spirit of making my Medium posts way too long, below I have listed 60
examples of things YOU COULD DO AND SAY if you play your cards right. But,
given that I’m known to point out problems… I want you to ask yourself about
what is stopping you from saying these things. What is the “yeah but”. Or if
you can say them, what decision made that possible? And then reflect on how
you can remove that constraint.

  1. “Maybe we can borrow a developer from another team? It would be helpful to get a fresh pair of eyes on the problem.”
  2. “Very reassuring to be able to test this in a production-like environment. But without the risk of harming customers if something goes wrong.”
  3. “Let’s colocate the teams during the kickoff.”
  4. “We may need to block out some of Team B’s time. But we’re not sure. It could go either way. Glad we have the flexibility of short notice scheduling.”
  5. “We’ll benefit by having rapid access to customers. We have a list of customers that we’d like to contact in the next week.”
  6. “Yes. We can hit that date within +/- 10d.”
  7. “If the early data is encouraging, the team would like to continue iterating before jumping to another effort.”
  8. “At the moment, our scaling predictions are very rough. Luckily we can add computing/network resources if required.”
  9. “The team can talk this out together. I know the topic is a bit sensitive, but there’s an upside.”
  10. “I consider myself lucky to work with people who aren’t all the same. The diversity of viewpoints and work styles is energizing.”
  11. “The problem was quickly isolated to a tiny set of customers.”
  12. “We’re not sure when we’ll need to talk to the UX Designer. But we will eventually. He’s available on short notice, right?”
  13. “Since this will impact marketing, it would be great if at least a couple folks from that team could attend standup. Who is coming?”
  14. “This is a great candidate for an A/B experiment. Let’s get it going.”
  15. “Doug has many strengths as a new team member, but he will really benefit from closely pairing with that senior dev Maria for the first month or so. Maria has available cycles, right?”
  16. “Anyone can take that front end story.”
  17. “Ideally for this project we’ll be able to deploy on our own schedule, and without bugging Ops. Cool?”
  18. “We have decided to pull this feature. It is rarely used, and it adds a lot of complexity to this area of the code.”
  19. “We can hand over the reigns of the service to another team if you’d like. It’ll take a week or so of onboarding, but not much more.”
  20. “I spoke up about that issue at the company meeting. I know it was hard to hear, but I’m positive we can learn from that failure.”
  21. “We have some slack. We’d be happy to knock that high priority item out for you.”
  22. “What a great opportunity! That area of the codebase is decently re-factored. This is something we should act on. It’ll be high value for the company.”
  23. “I’ll just pop in to her office. It’s great when the CEO has open office hours.”
  24. “Ah. Peace and quite. I really need to limit some distractions to get this done.”
  25. “The meeting room is always available. It’s our team room! That means we can keep our stuff up on the wall.”
  26. “You don’t need to pick a track here. If you’d like to try management, and then go back to being an IC, there is no stigma.”
  27. “I was able to lay out the initiative in broad strokes and get going. There was a ton up in the air, so we needed to start digging in.”
  28. “Jira didn’t work for us. This was more of a Trello quarter. So we fired up Trello.”
  29. “Even if they are a great performer from a financial perspective, it is never OK to keep a toxic person here at the company. We took action and fired them.”
  30. “Operations wasn’t his strong suit. So he willingly shifted roles. And now things are working so much more smoothly.”
  31. “We’re going to be using more Go and Scala moving forward. Luckily, our teams are fast studies. The transition shouldn’t be tough, and we’re ok with making that investment.”
  32. “Customer Success has such good insights on our customers. I’m happy to be able to draw on that knowledge when considering new features.”
  33. “Multiple teams can work on that product and deploy on their own schedules.”
  34. “It’s reassuring to do larger scale retrospectives, and to have the larger global blockers removed.”
  35. “There’s enough time in the week to do some unstructured innovation work. It doesn’t need to be company oriented, either.”
  36. “It’s nice not to have to put up your guard when C-level people come by.”
  37. “Our compliance environment is tough, but we have taken a “compliance as code” approach. I’m so much more confident this way. And the teams don’t get bogged down as much. We automate as much as possible.”
  38. “It was hard to kill the project that late in the game, we all agreed it it was in the best interest of our customers and internal teams.”
  39. “Luckily there is great test coverage in that area of the codebase. It shouldn’t be hard to do an incremental refactor. I was worried for a second that we’d need to do a parallel rewrite.”
  40. “Please. Enjoy your paternity leave. Don’t worry about us. We’ll be OK for the next eight weeks.”
  41. “Localization shouldn’t be a big lift. We’ll get on it in a couple weeks.”
  42. “Thanks for asking! Let’s take a look at the card wall, and I’ll talk you through the work.”
  43. “It’s safe for us to augment this project with contractors. They can be effective AND not screw anything up.”
  44. “It’s a relief to be able to make a data-informed decision on this.”
  45. “The interns have arrived! One of my favorite times of the year is working with interns on their intern projects. Sure, we hire some. But it also help the senior folks hone their teaching and mentoring skills.”
  46. “I used the company card to order lunch. Our expense reports run automatically.”
  47. “We spent the day visiting customers with the whole team. It was awesome to see everyone connect with our users.”
  48. “Adding measurement to that area of the product was super simple. Even for a non-technical person. Good thing we didn’t need to bug our developers.”
  49. “You’re free to shift around between teams, which is nice when you are looking for a new challenge. There’s nothing worse than feeling stale.”
  50. “Shit happens. But when a production issue comes up we have enough slack to actually get to the bottom of it. Putting out fires is OK. Solving the problem (so it never comes back) is satisfying.”
  51. “Potential new hires can join us for two weeks to do real work. It is good for us and them.”
  52. “The CEO “ask me anything” was refreshing.”
  53. “The team (developers and UX) can pretty much handle the effort on their own. With the help of their part-time agile coach, they’ve shifted off Scrum, don’t need a manager, and leave the PM to focus on bringing in outside context.”
  54. “Sometimes you just need an individual challenge. Once you’ve been here for a year or two, we allow developers to work on an individual project to really push their limits. And then they return refreshed to a team.”
  55. “We caught the threat very early. What a relief. We all got to bed at a reasonable time that night.”
  56. “The pattern library has made it super easy to build quick prototypes. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel. Instead of using Slack or InVision, our UXDs can just assemble working interfaces.”
  57. “We can take a new grad and get them up to speed quickly. They stay, too! It is rewarding to help someone get situated in their career.”
  58. “Having time set aside to attend conferences as a team has really helped us hone our chops.”
  59. “We always had a hunch this might work. To get a working prototype out there in front of customers so quickly — warts and all — was such an asset. Otherwise we would have had to make a big project out of it.”
  60. “The best part is knowing if the work we’re doing is actually have an impact. It is great for retention.”


# Problems! Problems? Problems.

All companies have problems (they signal opportunities)

### Problems! Problems? Problems.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MHZ5BFR4VgUCBPCj9DIVGQ.png)

<https://xkcd.com/1739/>

  1. All companies have problems (they signal opportunities)
  2. Some problems are more important than other problems
  3. Trying to solve too many problems at once is problematic
  4. But, importantly, ignoring a problem will impact your team
  5. Those impacted will want to understand why you are causing them anxiety, uncertainty, lowered career satisfaction, and lowered career opportunities
  6. Saying “be patient, it just isn’t as important as [the more important option], here is why, and this is how we’ll measure progress” is VERY difficult to do. It requires transparency and psychological safety.
  7. So we concoct vague and middling statements and/or try to fix the problem in a half-assed manner. It becomes “Medium Priority”. This is repeated with multiple problems. It becomes difficult to understand relative priority
  8. No one wants to admit that something isn’t important (right now). Meanwhile, those impacted start to reject the blatant coherence issues. Do they care? Why not? They must have malicious intent!
  9. The middling, poorly resourced efforts to fix the Medium Priority problem loose steam. This casts doubt on those impacted (and the people who manage them). Which triggers a confrontational, protective stance.
  10. Which then causes more problems

**The lesson for leaders: **Explain the why. Focus. Show humility. Don’t lie to yourself and others. Respect that your decisions have impact. Engage your people in solving the most important problems impacting the business.


# The Dumb Google Kid

Here is the problem.

* * *

### The Dumb Google Kid

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TQK5mjuWU9QjEu6wrg0E9w.png)

Here is the problem.

[By linking together various unsubstantiated and vague
statements](http://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-
diversity-screed-1797564320), the Google employee sounds reasonable. His piece
says everything and nothing. It jumps between diversity, biology, internal
Google politics, national politics, gender, and business (and more). To the
uninformed, his motives appear both pure and obtuse.

It is _dangerous_ because the lazy reader can ascribe whatever bias they want
to the piece. Every reader will find something “smart” sounding in there. But
on the whole — when you stitch the parts together — it is ineffective and rife
with logical fallacies. It’s just not great (or good) writing. It isn’t crisp
and direct. Assuming he had an objective… he likely didn’t/won’t achieve that
objective, unless that goal was to destabilize his employer.

I’m not even judging his viewpoint. He did, and wrote, a dumb thing. There are
other people who have shared his opinions, but have framed the issue far more
eloquently.

Maybe he is smart, and this was a lapse. Maybe — as he mentions — men have a
habit of doing risky/stupid shit like publishing poorly written 10 page
screeds to their company intranets. Maybe he thought, deep down, that he was
helping his company by regurgitating 4+ traditions of rebuttal to diversity in
tech.

It will hurt our economy. On Monday morning, tech companies (not just Google)
will have to spend/lose millions of dollars to unwind the laziness in this
person’s delivery and thinking. Why? It will embolden people who haven’t
thoroughly researched the issue. Companies will lose people. Lots of meetings
will happen.

And … damn Google, you need to figure out how to talk about diversity
internally. Authoritarian? Thought police?

This hit me when I tried to parse the various statements in the piece. My
first instinct was to start researching and disproving. But then I realized
that would do no good. Instead I tried to play the part of the naive Google
fanboy. And that’s where this gets scary (because I’ve already seen how this
people are responding). To the lazy/uninformed reader this is “common sense”.

Let’s look at the effect…

The entries follow this format:

> What the Google employee wrote

What the lazy reader will process (I method acted)

* * *

> I value diversity and inclusion

Phew. We all love diversity

> we need to look at population level differences in distributions

That sounds smart!

> If we can’t have an honest discussion

We all like honesty

> our culture of shaming and misrepresentation is disrespectful

Shaming sucks. We need to respect each other!

> and the possibility of being fired

Fire someone for speaking their mind? Fuck!

> shaming into silence is the antithesis of psychological safety

Shaming again. And shutting people up? Damn

> This silencing has created an ideological echo chamber

I’ve heard about this echo chamber

> may in part explain

Oh cool. He’s not making a definitive statement

> People generally have good intentions

Yes they do! An optimist!

> open and honest discussion with those who disagree can highlight our blind
spots and help us grow

Growing. Everyone wants to grow. Let’s lifehack

> discussion about these biases is being silenced by the dominant ideology

Damn that dominant ideology. Thought-police

> that desperately needs to be told at Google

I can feel his desperation

> the overwhelming majority of the social sciences, media, and Google lean
left

Well, we all know about the Media. Must be true

> Neither side is 100% correct

Now that’s pragmatic

> both viewpoints are necessary for a functioning society

Hmmm. Makes sense. Like Ying &amp; Yang

> Only facts and reason can shed light on these biases

Thank goodness. Something fact based

> Google’s left bias has created a politically correct monoculture

Wowzer. Mono what? PC? How compelling

> by shaming dissenters into silence

More shame. Dissent is good, right?

> This silence removes any checks against encroaching extremist and
authoritarian policies

I’m getting scared. Authoritarian, … but

> the extreme stance

Everyone is SO extreme these days

> the authoritarian element that’s required to actually discriminate to create
equal representation

Here come the thought police again

> Of course, men and women experience bias, tech, and the workplace
differently

Of course!

> but it’s far from the whole story

Mystery … there’s more! Exciting!

> On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways

Well, I mean, women have breasts … right?

> I’m not saying that all men differ from women in the following ways

See, he’s reasonable

> I’m simply stating

Yeah … he’s modest. He’s simply stating

> Many of these differences are small

How small?

> and there’s significant overlap

How much?

> Women, on average, have more

On average? How much more?

> These two differences in part explain

I see, they partly explain

> More men may like coding

Yeah. They may. That’s a good assumption

> This leads to women generally

Generally?

> Note that these are just average differences

See, he’s smart and measured

> We need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism

Damn straight! I mean there’s a chance, right?

> without resorting to discrimination

Discrimination = bad

> Competitiveness and self reliance can be valuable traits

Of course they can. Look at the Patriots

> we shouldn’t necessarily disadvantage those that have them

Not necessarily. That makes sense

> Women on average

Average?

> men may disproportionately want to be in them

They may. He’s right.

> we should be optimizing for Google

Exactly! Why sacrifice company profits?

> I strongly believe in gender and racial diversity

See! He believes in diversity

> Google has created several discriminatory practices

Ooooh. I love dirt on the company that didn’t hire me

> Hiring practices which can effectively lower the bar

Effectively? Can? How effectively?

> both the morally and economically correct thing to do, but without evidence

Yeah. Without evidence! WTF?

> Thankfully, climate scientists and evolutionary biologists generally aren’t
on the right

My man! He’s a scientist! He’s not a nutjob

> humans are generally biased towards protecting females

No one messes with my girl (or my mom)

> the Left’s affinity for those it sees as weak

Snowflakes

> when a man complains about a gender issue issue [sic] affecting men, he’s
labelled as a misogynist and whiner[10]

This totally happens. Right?

> political correctness[11], which constrains discourse

We need to be less PC to have real discussions

Snowflakes. And authoritiarians

> that use violence and shaming to advance their cause

Violence? OK. Now shit is getting real

> the violent leftists protests

I saw the videos from Berkeley. Scary

> the frequent shaming in TGIF and in our culture

I feel bad for this guy. Shaming again?

> I’m not saying that diversity is bad

See! Diversity is good!

> we have an intolerance for ideas and evidence that don’t fit a certain
ideology

Intolerance is bad

> not saying that we should restrict people to certain gender role

See! He’s thinks you can be whatever you want

> treat people as individuals

Exactly! Because we’re all special

> not as just another member of their group (tribalism)

Tribalism is bad. Very bad

> we stop thinking about it in terms of costs and benefits

Yeah! At the end of the day it is about costs/benefits

> Viewpoint diversity is arguably the most important type of diversity

See! He believes in diversity. And he has facts!

> that feel like they need to stay in the closet to avoid open hostility

Those poor conservative guys. WTF is happening?

> We should empower those with different ideologies to be able to express
themselves

Because that is what America is about!

> Alienating conservatives is both non-inclusive and generally bad business

Bad business? Ooooh, that is compelling

> tend to be higher in conscientiousness

See! That isn’t reported as much

> breaking down Googlegeist scores by political orientation and personality

That sounds smart!

> Have an open and honest discussion

Openness. Honesty. I’m really like this guy

> are highly politicized which further alienates non-progressives

Exactly. You wouldn’t want to alienate us further

> We should focus on psychological safety

How touching

> Having representative viewpoints is important for those designing and
testing our products

He knows about UX as well!

> While I strongly support trying to understand how and why people think the
way they do

He’s curious

> Our focus on microaggressions

Hahaha. Microagressions

> sensitivity increases both our tendency to take offense and our self
censorship

Snowflakes

> Speaking up without the fear of being harshly judged is central to
psychological safety

Damn straight! Don’t judge the guy

> Microaggression training incorrectly and dangerously equates speech with
violence

Big words. Like the NRA threatening violence?

> not all differences are socially constructed

No. Not all are. Indisputable

> the political bias of the presentation is clear from the factual
inaccuracies and the examples shown

Damn biased politics

> I can’t speak about other offices or countries

Oh how smart of him. He gets it

> Of course, I may be biased

See, he even accepts his biases

> a classical liberal

OMG. You’re kidding me. He has balls!

> Communism promised

You have me by the heart strings. Communism?

> transitioned from class warfare to gender and race politics

You mean like labor unions?

> Ironically, IQ tests were initially championed by the Left

Oh, that’s a good one!


# 11 Ways I Visualize Product Development Work

…sharing some drawings and notes from a whiteboard training today.

### 11 Ways I Visualize Product Development Work

…sharing some drawings and notes from a whiteboard training today.

Excuse spelling… its been a long day in the trenches!

The topic was **useful artifacts and visualizations (for PMs, product
development teams, etc.)**

* * *

As a PM you are always shifting context.

  * **Timeframe**. From today until two years from now
  * **Audience**. From developers to CEOs
  * **Scope**. From big picture strategy to tactical details
  * **Level of Certainty**. From vague guesses to hard facts
  * **Activity.** Making decisions, understanding status, providing necessary context, researching, facilitating meetings, [and about 100 other things]

Whenever you’re thinking high level, someone will bring you down to earth and
ask you to get into the weeds. Whenever you’re in the weeds, someone will
complain that you’re not being high level enough. It’s the burden we bear.
Just when you think you’ve figured things out, you’ll encounter a person who
needs to see your roadmap, or backlog, or “sprint backlog”, or “project”, or
“plan” in a whole new way.

So…changing delivery based on context is important. You could argue that it is
the biggest challenge facing PMs. It is a design problem!

I’d like to share a couple that work for me. There are more, but these are
some of my go-tos.

**_Note: Very importantly. These drawings are very, very purposefully rough. Don’t read too much into the words I use. I’m not in love with the word Epic, for example._**

* * *

#### **1\. One page roadmap**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9d0uE4GWH1cJh0e1xtnAQA.png)

Good for…

  * Connecting work to humans and their needs
  * Detailed idea of what is happening now
  * Sense of what is happening next (but more high level)
  * Clearly saying that some stuff will happen “later”
  * Great backdrop for chatting about the now, and the next couple quarters

#### **2\. Benefits map**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OMmcUo6yvnFNbjXfTVLKBg.png)

Good for…

  * Mapping your work to expected outcomes and benefits
  * Facilitating discussions about causation and correlation
  * Understanding the Why behind your current work
  * Metrics brainstorming (“how will we measure the outcome”)

#### [**3\. User story map**](http://jpattonassociates.com/user-story-
mapping/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GL1x-mT6a5vBx3tyea514Q.png)

Good for…

  * As a reminder to deliver horizontal slices across the problem space
  * To facilitate release planning, prioritization, and scoping
  * To keep the user journey/workflow/goal front stage
  * To see how the experience will evolve over time
  * PS: In my dream world, someone would make a user story map that could also be re-visualized as a kanban board. I think they’re probably the best all around tool for triggering conversations

#### **4\. Epic board**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WHj4v1SauVqgJk6Er6DRvg.png)

Good for…

  * Going a level above user stories
  * Prioritization discussions
  * Coarse-level backlog grooming

#### **5\. Timeline**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*m1Ku4kURXuHm3-yC0v1hNg.png)

Good for…

  * Seeing a linear progression of planned work
  * Communicating to people who think in terms of time/calendars
  * See how a particular value stream will evolve over time
  * **Warning:** I prefer not to see actual dates in the timeline. One trick is to obscure the timeline with a large “this month”, and smaller subsequent months … perhaps even keeping 6–12 months as a single block

#### **6\. “Standup” Board**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VLZ4vVuYGkdKo18W9vwT5A.png)

Good for…

  * A centerpiece for day-to-day stand-ups
  * What is being worked on right now?
  * Resolving blockers and dependencies
  * Knowing what is in PR review, staging, prod, etc.

#### **7\. Mind map with horizons**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*a8hK2zyp0NhvSNJWuwjVCQ.png)

Good for…

  * Understanding planning horizons. Mountains rarely move, and rocks can be thrown over cliffs
  * Connecting work items to the central beliefs/assumptions of the organization
  * Reinforcing that tactics/experiments may change, but the Why remains

#### **8\. Combined Epic/Story board**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KNTHOfcpltXg21PILzCvPA.png)

Good for…

  * Attempting to reiterate the goal. Why are we writing these stories?
  * Situations where you are “moving a metric”, and that the team will continue until you hit that metric
  * Trying to merge the “bigger picture” with day-to-day activities

#### **9\. Big visual checklist**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0YkIcM-1FbPaLEQjmQ9xGQ.png)

Good for…

  * A sense of accomplishment (“checking things off list”)
  * Planning and brainstorming
  * Sometimes, success is truly about ripping through stories (not often, in my book)

#### [10\. Impact map](https://uxpressia.com/blog/build-impact-map-4-easy-
steps).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GdBDuQ3ojrloUVoeVEe2Mg.png)

Good for…

  * Similar to the benefits map
  * Importantly, includes the Who
  * Can be a better option when words like “Outcome” and “Intervention” scare people away

#### **11\. Experiment timeline**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SYaU_7wVBAy730ROVhJgug.png)

Good for…

  * Showing how work is mapping to our efforts to move a metric
  * Showing the forecast (and the baseline)
  * Plotting our progress
  * Importantly, this is not velocity of work or a burn-down


# The Agile Police

Seriously. Sometimes I need to step out of the Agile echo chamber.

### The Agile Police

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kKuWsS9z82xTGJkhkOB4eA.png)

Gratuitous clip art so that Medium has a preview image.

Seriously. Sometimes I need to step out of the Agile echo chamber.

We (me included) go and on about extending agility to the the “whole
organization”, but do a terrible job at communicating to non-developers. And
then, to top it off, we blame “waterfall thinking outside of teams” on why
[some effort] failed to produce meaningful results. Kind of circular, huh?

We talk about Agile (and defend Agile) in ways that we would instantly
recognize as unproductive and destined to fail if we observed those behaviors
on teams and organizations. In fact, it smacks of the behavior we constantly
deride in toxic senior leaders, managers, etc.

Granted, these are (mostly) conversations between the already converted.
Echoes in the echo chamber. But people “from the outside” notice and learn
from these conversations. They see quibbling and aggressiveness. It’s bad PR.
And bad service design.

We are (and embarrassingly I am, at times) conveying ….

> You’re not Agile. It smells bad. You just don’t get it. Your antiquated
business practices are incompatible with an agile approach. You’re too far
gone. No Agile team works that way. You’re abusing [some term]. You’re abusing
[some practice]. You don’t trust anyone. SAFe can’t save you! Back in the day
we didn’t need this stinking process. You are petty. You are a bean counter.
Why can’t you evolve?

I do think it is important to communicate an “authentic” Agile message… one
distinct from the message of the Agile Industrial Complex. And I do believe
strongly that new ideas are possible, and support efforts like [Joshua
Kerievsky](https://medium.com/u/28229c304ac9)’s Modern Agile thing. But, we
need to consider the onboarding and UX of our message. Because it will —
almost by definition — be a little flakier and less concrete than the 50 page
SAFe RFPs.

Anyway. My resolution is to be more empathetic, and to appreciate just how
counter-intuitive some of our “ways” must appear to smart people without a
background in organizations that made it work.

Show more. Listen more. Tell less. Police less.

### Sample Product Development Flow

Sharing a sample product development flow (the working pattern for my current
team).

Something I’ve learned over the years…

**You have to TRY!**

Your team needs to _own its words and working agreements._ I’ve seen certified
Scrum Masters (and Product Managers, Engineering Managers, and Developers) use
the words, but not understand the first principles at play. Trying to paint-
by-numbers is dangerous (in my honest opinion). So is assuming that you need
to do every meeting — and every bit of process — to complete work.

### 10 Tips For Taming Slack Overload

#### Sharing a couple quick tips for taming
[Slack](https://medium.com/u/26d90a99f605) overload…

Slack is an awesome tool. But it isn’t magic (yet). I very much appreciate
their mission:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pzcEdTmvF8_a-djMvqfusw.png)

But sometimes I could swear it is making my life more complicated, adding
cognitive load, and making me less product. Not Slack itself … but our use of
the tool.

Slack represents the communication channels in your org in all their gory
complexity. You need to garden channels and their purposes frequently,
otherwise the whole thing explodes. Which is something I actually like about
Slack…it forces you to confront your expectations with team mates and make
your working agreements explicit (but malleable).

Whenever I hear someone say “I hate Slack”, what I’m actually hearing is “I
hate how our nebulous communication channels and working agreements manifest
in Slack”. With that, I share some tips from battling
[Slack](https://medium.com/u/26d90a99f605) entropy.

* * *

1 — Keep the topic (and style/type) of messages relevant to the purpose of the
channel.

2 — When creating channels think of the messages that will fill the channel.
Ideally, a channel should have messages with a similar profile across these
six dimensions:

  * How actionable are the messages? Are they questions/requests, or more general in nature (FYI, announcements)?
  * How quickly do the messages need to be addressed?
  * How important are the messages?
  * How narrow or broad is the audience for these messages?
  * How long do you expect exchanges resulting from these messages to last
  * How similar are these messages from a topic perspective?

_NOTE: This doesn’t mean every channel should be super-specific. It just means
that super-general channels aren’t the best place for super-specific
conversations._

_NOTE: Urgent doesn’t always mean important. “Hey, we’re meeting for lunch in
the lobby” needs to be read and acted on quickly. It isn’t as important as a
major issue in production._

3 — Review your channels regularly. Have they drifted / evolved?

4 — Distinguish between channels that should be 1) “read” by all members (e.g.
announcements, where everyone is expected to read all the messages) and 2)
channels used to get answers, quickly collaborate, etc. (where you can scan
for mentions, and mostly ignore everything else).

  * Post to announcement channels sparsely. Limit discussion on these channels
  * Set working agreements for specific channels like “we address questions there in __ minutes” or “everyone monitors that for questions” or “everyone reads every one of these posts”. Put that in the purpose of the channel.

5 — For regular (more specific) topics, create new perpetual channels.
Examples might include coordinating deployments, reviewing PRs, etc.

6 — Having “lots of channels” is not a bad thing, as long as there are not big
purpose overlaps.

  * Slack has tons of features to make managing channels easier
  * See sidebar options (to hide up to date channels), and notification keywords
  * Use keyboard shortcuts (my favorite is Command K to quickly access channels by name)
  * **In short, taming lots of channels is easier than taming obtuse threads and channels**

7 — In every request/question, remember to clarify your desired next step.
What do you need from people? Who can help?

  * Consider the creative use of :symbols: (e.g. checkbox for a to-do, or :eyes: for must read items). It makes scanning easier
  * Keep in mind that complex problems may require face-to-face (or video conferencing) interaction
  * Imagine someone arriving late in the game. Will they have all the context?
  * Consider doing a summary post to clarity the thread

8 — You should probably have an “@” in your message.

  * If you need the attention of specific people, remember to “@” them. If you are replying to a specific person “@” them
  * “@here” is used to get the immediate attention of people who are available, and might be able to help you. “@here” is basically like asking everyone the question.
  * @here **IS NOT **a great way to indicate that something is important
  * If you don’t have an “@” mention in your message, then either the channel is announcement based, or perhaps it is exclusively for general questions. Remember… do the members of the channel expect to have to read every single message?

9 — Create new channels for adhoc discussions. Threads were a good idea, but
they tend to cause more confusion than they solve (as currently designed).
Channels &gt; threads. They have super powers (and aren’t annoying). Follow
these guidelines:

  * add a prefix … d=discussion, i= issue to resolve
  * add a specific suffix (e.g. d_jira1394)
  * reference that discussion in general channel (“we will be talking about _____ in ______”)
  * have a “purpose:”. Indicate the outcome that will trigger the closing of the channel
  * close the channel once you have reached the outcome
  * Use the star feature to keep active adhoc channels on your sidebar (see the settings that include starred channels on your sidebar)

10 — If a specific conversation is involving a lot of back and forth (and is
devolving away from the purpose of the channel) … it should be in an adhoc
channel (see above) or a thread. Don’t let it pollute the current channel

What has worked for you? How do you make Slack work for you and your team?


# Good (But Hard) Questions — Episode 1

Why?

* * *

### Good (But Hard) Questions — Episode 1

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*L23Ug4upCBkUitSWbSyGtw.png)

  1. If culture is how we act, what is the most destructive behavior we tolerate? Why?
  2. Do we believe _better_ is possible? Is better necessary?
  3. What and when do we celebrate? What does that say about us?
  4. Where do we accept mediocrity, and where do we demand excellence?
  5. Do we have shared understanding on what we’d like to improve, and what we are willing to sacrifice _in order to_ improve?
  6. What would need to happen for us to make the difficult decisions?
  7. What is a statement we hear frequently when receiving feedback, but that we flat-out reject?
  8. Where are we receiving late feedback (that is too late to be actionable)? Why was it delayed?
  9. What obvious solutions do we dismiss? Why?
  10. Are the right people talking?
  11. Are our doors really open? Should they be?
  12. Which voices should we be amplifying, but aren’t?
  13. Change is often a battle of different change agendas. Who is battling to own/control how we change, and why? Are there overlaps?
  14. Where are we seeing hints of a possible future? Is it a good future?
  15. Why do people stay? Why do people leave? What can we learn from that?
  16. What _can’t_ we fix, _even if_ it causes pain to our people?
  17. What are we doing “just because”? Why?
  18. How do decisions really get made here?
  19. What does the unofficial org chart look like?
  20. Where are we attacking a symptom instead of the root cause? What effect does that have?
  21. A year from now, what will we still be talking about?
  22. Where must trust and safety be repaired?
  23. What can’t we see because we are too immersed in the system?
  24. If a “fresh set of eyes” joined us, what would they see that we can’t see?
  25. Who internally exemplifies the behavior we’d like to model our culture around? What do they do?
  26. In what ways do we encourage local behavior that is effective, but not in alignment with our global goals/needs?
  27. When are we more than the sum of our parts? When are we less than the sum of our parts (we bring each other down)?
  28. What are our most intractable problems? Why have we failed to make a dent in these issues? Why are they so stubborn?
  29. Do we trust our immediate peers? Do we have confidence in their abilities?
  30. Scale almost always causes entropy and an increase in complexity. How are we taming these forces?
  31. Where is the good we must amplify?
  32. Where are our strengths also our weaknesses?
  33. What do our individual contributors see that we don’t see?
  34. What do we see that is difficult (or impossible) to communicate to our individual contributors?
  35. Where are the areas of frequent confusion and poor shared understanding?
  36. What (or who) is the elephant in the room? How have we contributed to _keeping_ the elephant in the room?
  37. What is trying to emerge? Are we rejecting it? Encouraging it?


# Limit PIP (Promises In Progress)

I riffed recently on the idea of PIP (promises in progress).

### Limit PIP (Promises In Progress)

I riffed recently on the idea of PIP (promises in progress).

> [](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/898586986289668097)

The idea is growing on me. First, because it explains how some organizations
go downhill. And second, it helped me reflect on how and why I throw off
promises in my day to day work (and sometimes don’t keep those promises).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*G5LTJdpH8d7hLHxJ_YqaOQ.png)

<https://louisandmelcomics.wordpress.com/tag/cartoon/>

Imagine you have a note taking robot at your disposal. The robot records every
new promise made by people in your company — explicit or implicit, emotional
or functional or social, aspirational or realistic. Everything! Gifted with an
unlimited power supply (and storage), it moves on to survey for existing
promises, expectations, and commitments. The robot does this every day.

How long is the list? How many items get added every day? How many things get
ignored? Who has dashed hopes? Maybe no one cares? Maybe they do.

During a day at work recently, I tried to be that robot. I recorded every hint
of a promise made during the three hours of meetings that day. The list was
massive, and only a tiny percentage of the promises were captured somewhere
(outside of my list). Most of the officially recognized promises lacked real
clarity, next steps, and shared understanding. The implicit ones were all over
the place… who knows how people interpreted them. Even when there seemed to be
agreement, I couldn’t really tell.

A CEO once told me that he expected “motivated” people to “load themselves up
with too much to do, and routinely drop balls, but don’t screw up the
important tasks.” According to their view of work (and life), unless someone
is maxed out, they aren’t trying hard enough. Now multiply this across the
organization. What happened? Predictably, people struggled with debilitating
stress. But they were also hurt because other teammates (including leaders)
had broken their promises to them, often unintentionally. The situation slowly
spiraled out of control.

Every person there wanted to please and wanted to make things work. The decay
starts when — in our effort to keep some promises — we let other promises
slide. We mean well, but just can’t deliver on all fronts. Most of the time
it’s OK. I mean hell, everyone is so busy! But the cracks in trust,
psychological safety, and respect begin to form.

Maybe we start to drift on something fundamental — like a promise to ship
high-quality products, do right by customers, hire the best, or respect our
co-workers. But the increments of drift are small. They happen one iteration,
one vanity feature, one hire, and one frustrated snide remark at a time. And
all the while we are generating new well-meaning and hopeful promises. How
many meetings end with a couple of good ideas, and some offers to “check that
out and follow-up”? How many all-hands conclude with a small group deciding to
take on a problem outside of their day-to-day?

In [Drift into Failure: From Hunting Broken Components to Understanding
Complex Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Drift-into-Failure-Components-
Understanding/dp/1409422216), Sydney Dekker describes how drift works:

> Drift occurs in small steps. This can be seen as decrementalism, where
continuous organizational and operational adaptation around goal conflicts and
uncertainty produces small, step-wise normalizations of what was previously
judged as deviant or seen as violating some safety constraint. Each decrement
is only a small deviation from the previously accepted norm, and continued
operational success is taken as a guarantee that the small adaptations are
safe, and will not harm future safety.

I have observed this dynamic with broken promises (what Dekker would probably
call “goal conflicts”). As mentioned above, many of these promises are never
made concrete or explicit.

David Allen (the Getting Things Done guru) calls these things “open loops,”
“incompletes,” or “stuff.” His method recommends getting these things “out of
your head and into a system” so that you can focus on getting things done. But
anyone who has managed a product backlog (or set of action items for a complex
project, or software development team) knows how quickly this can get out of
control. You quickly hit a point of acute cognitive overload. There’s no way
you can keep it all together, and still get any work done.

In any busy environment, you’ll find people at their absolute limit.

Something has to give. So while functioning at a high level, we also let
things slide. Which then brings about Dekker’s “step-wise normalizations.”
When I talk to people who are frustrated by their work environment, they
frequently refer to what I now call broken promises:

  * Someone has betrayed their trust or has stopped showing respect
  * People act in ways that are not coherent with stated values
  * The extra resources never arrived
  * Another team failed to do their side of the bargain
  * Their teammates didn’t offer to help in a bind
  * The company transgressed on its commitment to craft and quality
  * Promotions feel unfair and not equally applied
  * Their team never iterated on the MVP, as promised
  * The challenging projects never arrive
  * Success theater is rewarded over hard work
  * The company has stopped caring about innovation

To top it off, they frequently don’t notice their broken promises.

The terrifying thing here is that to turn the tide you need to both 1) start
delivering on your promises, and 2) do so while trust is lacking and you need
people’s help. When you need trust the most, it is missing. That’s fricking
hard, especially when the person might be blaming individuals and situations
that are suffering under the same state of overload. The irony is that all of
the hard, cognitively taxing work in the current situation has become
normalized, whereas the hard work required for change is acute and
distasteful. It is easier to remain in the status quo.

But remember when the company knocked [some effort] out of the park? It all
seemed to change then, right?

Most software product developers have experienced a “swarm” or “surge” or
“final push” on a high priority initiative. The team rallies to get something
high priority done. Later at the bar (because, you know, you celebrate these
types of things…it’s actually rewarded), the stereotypical executive says
something like this:

> Don’t you see what we can do when we put our mind to it! Why can’t all
efforts be like this! We should do this all the time!

To which the maxed out (and buzzed) individual contributors reply:

> Of course it worked …. because we focused on something. Are you willing to
let us focus in the future? Or do we need to keep all of the other promises
we’ve kept.

A project manager ambles along with their white wine and says something like:

> Well, if we only had a better system for tracking all of our deliverables,
and for estimating better, we’d be able to handle all of this. We just need a
better process. Then we can split story points across all of our tasks, and
hold daily dependency and risk-mitigation check-ins.

What happens next? Does anything change? No, the drift continues. Something
gives (probably quality, or keeping your best team members). Schedules
eventually slip because quality has slipped, and you’ve lost your best team
members. An environment of low trust percolates, and only the fittest (most
adaptable in low trust environments) survive.

I’ve written a good deal about Kanban and the value of WIP (work in progress)
constraints. But I realized recently that “the work” is only a small
percentage of the promises we keep “at work”. As we add complexity to our
products and organizations and relationships, we do so by creating a web of
promises and commitments, ranging from explicit and actional to “open loops,”
“incompletes,” and “stuff.” Promises are, in effect, dependencies. We can
break them — and break the dependency — but that will have a ripple effect
elsewhere.

To counteract this drift, I’d like to advance the idea of limiting PIP
(promises in progress), and reducing the size of your promise overhead to what
is manageable and humane. Optimize for promise flow efficiency.

Why use a loaded word like Promise? It feels kind of contracty. It feels like
a manager asking for _predictability_, and “doing what you said you were going
to do”. That’s not what I’m thinking about. Though that might be a byproduct.

I feel that trust is built and grown by frequently keeping our promises.
Research says that delivering frequently on small promises beats out large
promises delivered infrequently. I am NOT just referring to our promises to
finish projects or check off action items (which might indeed be the least
important promises we make). I include things like the promises in your
culture deck, the promise to keep reasonable work hours, the promise of
psychological safety, the promise to mentor co-workers, and the promise to
engage people with challenging, but meaningful work.

To succeed at keeping our promises, we need to be incredibly disciplined about
communicating and building shared understanding. One person’s “great idea you
must do immediately” is another person’s “thing I might want to try
eventually.” One person’s “they are going to help me advance in my career” is
another person’s “we’ll chat about career stuff occasionally.” So you need
that discipline.

Make fewer promises! Keep more promises. Deliver on promises. Respect the
cognitive overhead of active promises. Prioritize. And make the promise that
matters most: to trust and respect the people you work with.

Software product development is hard.

Gratuitous, free-to-use photograph of something kind of difficult looking (so
Medium has an image)

Doing the hard work takes trust and safety. Without trust and safety,
individuals and companies go into self-preservation mode. In these conditions
we replace trust with process, and collaboration with control.

All companies have problems. The _best _companies prioritize the most
threatening problems and deal with them. New ones pop up, and they keep
dealing with them. Complexity creeps up, and they tame it. Everyone has faith
that “the important things will get worked out”. Promises (especially the
promises for support and respect) are kept. These companies hold entropy at
bay, because if you fall too far behind, you’ll never dig yourself out of the
hole.

To quote the great Greg Lemond:

> “It never gets easier, you just go faster.

A lot of continuous improvement is just making it _possible_ to do the hard
work (the effective work) and face challenges when they arise.

Because …

  * Learning new skills is hard
  * Confronting trust issues on your team is hard
  * Pairing and mobbing is hard
  * Admitting you’re wrong is hard

  * Recruiting users/customers for interviews is hard
  * Firing a toxic “high performer” is hard
  * Coaching teams is hard
  * Building shared understanding is hard

Continuous Improvement

### Continuous Improvement Vs. Continuous Suckage

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2mk0UbudCoHIdhf-Cr32Gw.png)

### Continuous Improvement

  1. A facilitator helps the team run a good retrospective (and learn how to run their own retrospectives)
  2. Underscore spirit of blameless retro. Establish safety. Provide coaching prior to retro if needed. Team able to “get real”
  3. Accentuate the good. What’s working? What should we amplify?
  4. Review output of prior retro. Team bubbles up new internal _and external_ issues impacting their performance (ideally supported with qualitative and quantitative data).
  5. Team also reflects on success of continuous improvement efforts
  6. Team prioritizes issues to fix and brainstorms possible interventions
  7. Team secures help for resolving external blockers (and establishes way to track these blockers)
  8. Team tries limited number of interventions
  9. Repeat…rapidly
  10. If certain issues persist, agree to escalate issues to a trusted leader for help and support

### **Continuous Suckage**

  1. Manager facilitates retro without prior experience
  2. Team afraid to “rat out” co-workers and/or threaten their individual job prospects
  3. Punt on dealing with interpersonal issues. Doesn’t “get real”
  4. New processes created to fill trust void and “prove who is slacking”. Manager opts to deal with individuals directly, and not whole team. Manager dictates process
  5. Turns into blame session
  6. Team gets tired of bringing up chronic issues (especially external issues, that never get addressed) or brings them up and gets chastised for not being team players
  7. Lack of accountability for continuous improvement efforts. High “change in progress”
  8. External communication owned by manager, who attempts to preserve optics. Lack of coherence
  9. Repeat. Long delivery cycles masks actual progress
  10. If issues persist, manager and team develop alternate narratives to protect their self interests

### All Companies Have Problems (Some Are Healthy, Some Are Lucky)

#### **A toxic individual occupies your company**.

The healthy organization will increase local blood flow and send in cells from
the immune system to attack and destroy the bacteria.

#### **A team is wounded**.

In a healthy organization a clot will form, then inflammation, then new tissue
growth, and finally “maturation and remodeling”.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tWz26tw6dKfBVuK80SMwCQ.png)

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing>

#### **The organization is temporarily off-balance**.

Various systems coordinate a response:

> Balance is the result of a number of body systems working together: the eyes
(visual system), ears (vestibular system) and the body’s sense of where it is
in space (proprioception) ideally need to be intact.
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_balance))

You get the idea.

In the face of challenges and opportunities, the healthy organization can
sense, respond, repair, rebuild, regulate, learn, strengthen, and defend.

We often single out individuals and “problem teams”. Why can’t they figure it
out? Why aren’t the improving? Why can’t the be as awesome as Team X? Maybe
they are incompetent? Maybe we need a re-org? It’s all about trying to fix the
specific person, team, or project or making sure **_that exact thing_** never
happens again. And this can drag out forever in a game of endless
Whack-a-mole. Managers and leaders seem to thrive on this game.

We don’t spend enough time asking _why_ the organism (the organization) is
allowing the damage to persist. In many cases it simply isn’t a priority,
despite what people say. There are _too many problems_, and not enough energy
to repair those problems.

> This problem has been going on for YEARS!

Translation: We have let this problem go on for years.

Or perhaps the system is incapable of coordinating, communicating, and
executing a response because of some sort of underlying disease, deficiency,
blockage, split-focus, or imbalance.

> By the time we get the committee together to address the problem, it has
changed in nature!

All companies have problems. It’s just that some companies fix their problems
faster and with less energy, and side-effects. They don’t let those issues
accumulate and become chronic. It doesn’t mean that everything is incremental.
Sometimes you _have _to do the big re-org. But the system bounces back quickly
(and typically stronger).

I think that is how I’d describe a healthy organism… and a healthy
organization.

### Extra Strength 5-hour AGILE

It’ll get you through the day.

Today I want to discuss 5hr Agile, aka Quick Fix Agile, aka We Need To Go
Faster Right Now Agile.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qxylXoKJB997NJ6gg2ozRA.png)

Here’s what concerns me.

We owe it to companies (our companies if we’re on the inside) to be honest
about the investment required to fundamentally change things. Installing [some
tool/method] is never enough. You won’t go from a four (on a scale of 1–10) to
a nine without some _serious work. _The turnaround will take years, not
months. And you’ll probably need to do some restructuring and hiring/firing.

If your company is doing OK, and you’re not willing to really commit … you’d
probably do better to save the money and disruption and preserve the status
quo. We’ve all read about the [accelerated death rates of public
companies](http://www.businessinsider.com/us-companies-are-dying-faster-than-
ever-2015-8), so maybe you’re fighting an uphill battle anyway. A half-hearted
foray into Lean/Agile won’t really change things much (see A below).

It’s like going to the gym once a week. You might as well save your knees.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*O4SldrWDlmoN_UudnlJAtg.jpeg)

If you’ve worked in a company doing “change-light” you know just how
frustrating it is. Front-line teams scurry to adopt the new way, and
management and leadership just remains the same. You lose your best people
because the change isn’t effective. “Let’s experiment” doesn’t cut it.

To make this work you’re going to need to…

  * Hire people who are comfortable working in the “new” way
  * Pay people who are not interested in working in the “new” way to leave
  * Ingrain continuous improvement into the DNA of the organization
  * Shift legacy mindsets, focusing especially on leadership and upper management
  * Slow down, limit work in progress, lower utilization rates
  * Make craft and quality a top priority
  * Make safety a prerequisite (see [Modern Agile](http://modernagile.org/))
  * Hire coaches and facilitators
  * Bring individual contributors closer to customers/users
  * Dedicate teams to outcomes/benefits (vs. solely to “shipping projects”)
  * Discontinue the use of proxy metrics (e.g. “velocity”) wherever possible
  * Remove layers of management (or retrain for new roles)
  * Change the management culture, expectations, and mandate
  * Combine certain departments (e.g. Operations and Engineering)
  * Embed UX, Data Science, and QA on product development teams
  * Reshape the role of QA across the organization and eliminate handoffs
  * Address dependencies (may involve hiring)
  * Change how you fund/resource initiatives and teams
  * Change how you architect and deploy your products/services
  * Visualize work on the portfolio/program/team level and address bottlenecks
  * Be more open and transparent
  * And more …

Not trivial, huh?

We dedicate tons of money to installing Agile practices that don’t rock the
boat. I’d argue that rocking the boat is exactly what you need to do.

### Fixing Quarterly Planning

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xCZX9amQWhhH_-zbI45rpA.png)

> I absolutely hate quarterly planning. It feels so counterproductive and
disruptive!

This post is about making quarterly planning more effective. You may have an
awesome quarterly planning approach. If so… You’re A Winner! For many PMs —
especially at bigger companies — the process is fraught with pain and
frustration.

#### It’s a non-subtle form of masochism: a 91.25 day sprint including 28 days
of planning, that doesn’t “work”.

Why?

Quarterly planning is disruptive when it introduces _too much new information
_at once: too many new projects, too many new dependencies, and too many
shifting priorities. There’s simply no way you can build adequate shared
understanding. Tweaking the planning quarterly is simply too slow (and too
disruptive) for a rapidly growing company. Without shared understanding,
you’ll never get optimal results. But we get caught up in the drama and
excitement and just perpetuate the problem.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FGfZZoNAhYAGGkMph1RkNg.png)

Equally disruptive is that we tend to synchronize _execution_ cadence with the
_planning and prioritization_ cadence. Somehow, all projects start to take
one, two, three, or four quarters. This worsens the quarterly “hit” (due to
harmonic oscillation), and impacts decision making. The shit goes down… at the
start and end of every quarter.

Common symptoms of a unhealthy quarterly planning process include:

  * Low completion rates (teams can’t meet their often artificial “commitments”)
  * Longer than normal lead times
  * Rework, or work items completely miss window of opportunity
  * Last minute dependency management (shared teams are overloaded)
  * Items in progress need to be “punted” to the next quarter
  * Teams rush to get their projects “in the system” for the next quarter
  * Silver bullet projects materialize
  * Network effects (snowball effect) as one shared team is delayed
  * Planning is rushed. People aren’t on the same page
  * Invisible work

> But isn’t this how you _have_ to do it? We want less process, not more! It
sucks, but there’s no other way! How can we move quickly unless we set stretch
goals!?

This isn’t how it has to be.

#### A Quick Scrum Diversion

Let’s check out a fixed-length sprint (Scrum) analogy. For a sprint to be
considered “successful”, you finish _all _of the _committed items. _You don’t
get _credit _for items left in progress. At the end of the sprint, you deliver
a potentially shippable increment (there are no multi-phase or artificially
split stories). The smart team figures out its _sprint velocity _by looking at
prior sprints, and sets a reasonable goal. And at the end of the sprint
there’s a retrospective and demo, and the whole process repeats.

Note the critical point here: the team bases velocity on actual data, and
embarks on a sustainable approach. You don’t beat yourself up!

This all takes incredible discipline and repetition. An organization that has
trouble “making its quarterly commitments”, does so for the exact reasons a
scrum team has trouble making its sprint commitments…albeit on **a much
grander scale**. These reasons typically include unplanned work, rework,
artificially splitting stories, multi-tasking, high utilization, handoffs,
dependencies, non-shippable work, external blockers, changing requirements,
overoptimism, etc.

It’s the usual suspects… but addressed every 91 days on, again, **a much
grander scale**.

On a scrum team you reflect and adapt. Typical fixes include taking on less
work, better story decomposition and grooming, fixing the source of production
issues, dedicated QA and UX, and more active dependency management.

Interestingly (and counterintuitively), Agile stalwart [Ron
Jeffries](https://medium.com/u/a45b68b1ab11) recommends (I’m paraphrasing)
“shortening the sprint, down to a day if necessary.” Can the team reliably
plan and deliver SOMETHING during the increment, even if it is a day? His
approach** starts with success and builds from there**. This is very different
from the idea of loading up a sprint (or quarter), doing your best, shooting
high, and just punting along the work that doesn’t get done.

> Ah! I see … we need to total up story points across 60 teams, do careful
estimation, and “fill up” the quarter just like we fill up a sprint! Right?

Nope. Scrum-don’t-play-that. But we’re getting close.

And this sort of gets to the crux of the problem. Consider how hard it is for
an individual team to crack this nut. Now increase the complexity non-linearly
across the whole organization. **There’s no possible way that a big-batch
planning approach across this many teams will EVER produce predictability.**
The system just can’t calibrate itself because 1) the calibrating and
inspect/adapt happens too infrequently, and 2) there are too many moving
parts.

### A Solution…

On a high level, the solution is to:

  1. Decouple planning, prioritization, and execution. Use just-in-time and cadenced meetings appropriately
  2. Adopt a pull-based approach instead of a push-based approach
  3. Make the next rolling 6–12 months of work visible, and always current

What do I mean?

Consider this Kanban board:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*KTuj4J7BxIEOR3Ln.)

  * Longer term prioritization occurs in A
  * Planning and coordination occurs in B
  * Dependency management is maintained through C
  * Last minute prioritization occurs in D. At this point it is committed. It’s going to happen
  * Checking in on execution happens in E
  * We review long term benefits delivered in F

This is a PULL system with WIP constraints. When Card 1 moves to Delivered,
work on Card 2 starts, and Card 3 is moved from Planning to Committed
(assuming it really is committed).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*YbFMZgqpJSACIgl5.)

Pull-based system. To move work “ahead”, a downstream item must move ahead

The important thing here from a quarterly planning standpoint is that you’ve
reduced the “big bang” nature of the exercise. By visualizing the upstream
part of the process — the prioritized backlog, planning, and commitment steps
— you’ll have far less “resetting” to do each quarter. If you do this right,
you’ll always have a year’s worth of work up there. Of course things will
change … you’ll pull things from planning, or shuffle priorities for committed
items, but it’s clear what is going on.

Executives often incorrectly assume that this approach will trigger anarchy.
The push-back goes as follows:

> _Us executives are so busy! The business works on a quarterly cadence, so we
need to set up a ton of meetings to review the quarter and give our blessing.
How can this ever work? Our calendar’s are full!_

_Side Note: Consider whether executive availability is the actual bottleneck_

The quarterly planning process becomes a way for senior people to exert
influence, get “face time”, horse-trade, and politic for their top priorities.
They kind of like it. They love the drama.

So this is where working agreements come in. For example (just riffing, I
wouldn’t do all this), you could decide that:

  * Directors meet monthly to review items in the **Planning** column
  * VPs review all items **In Progress** monthly
  * Quarterly, conduct a 60 person Kaizen event using board. Review all items
  * Any VP or above can expedite an item into the **Planning** column
  * Items that are L or XL need C-level approval to move into the **Committed** column
  * Any **Committed** items that has dependencies needs to be signed off on by all participating teams
  * An item stuck in **In Progress** for more than 180 days triggers an immediate COO facilitated meeting
  * Etc.

I’m more of a distributed decision making kind of person, but you can be as
command-and-control as you want here. Executives can be as involved as they
want to be. Some activities are:

  1. **Triggered **(e.g. backlog replenishment, when card count falls below X) and other activities are…
  2. **Cadenced** (e.g. monthly review of blocked In Progress items)

The key is to make the working agreements explicit and make the work visible.

How is this different than normal quarterly planning. Normal quarterly
planning is a PUSH based system, not a continuous PULL based system. Normal
quarterly planning is like the running of the bulls.

**Subway is a PULL based system**. Note how the sandwich-making is _never overloaded_. The line might grow slightly, but Subway gets the job done.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GOsNNK0LiwjztvavJ8yTAg.png)

A quarterly planning process can occur ON TOP OF a continuous flow-based,
pull-based system. We imagine a big calendar cut into four blocks and
mistakenly believe that “predictability” in this context involves dropping
work — the execution — into those blocks. Instead, think about regularly
scheduled (or just in time, pull based) meetings that keep watch over a flow
of work.

You go from this:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*c3a_Bg0U2TKeNlZ93fZAPQ.png)

To this ….

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*T5G3HFUee06POx8IesZ69w.png)

What you often learn is that the development teams were never the bottleneck.
Rather, it was shifting priorities, silver-bullets, and too much work in
progress that brought the operation to a grinding halt. Sure there were issues
with delivery, but the process itself obscured those issues. It made it
difficult to swarm resources on addressing those problems.

And now you can fix that. If you are unfamiliar with Kanban, [Amazon is your
friend](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Ddigital-
text&field-keywords=kanban).

* * *

> But when will things be done? That isn’t possible unless you put it in a
calendar.

That’s for another post, but the basic answer is that by limiting work in
progress and focusing on flow, you’ll be better able — using actual data for
different classes of work — to predict when something will be done. And do so
with far better confidence than a big-batch, wipe-the-slate-clean quarterly
planning process. This approach might not work well if you make your money
delivering singular, unique custom projects, but should be possible in a
modern SaaS company.


# Limit, Visualize, and Improve

I’ve been thinking lately about what it means to be disciplined in product
development work. How do we do the right thing, even when doing…

* * *

### Limit, Visualize, and Improve

I’ve been thinking lately about what it means to be _disciplined_ in product
development work. How do we do the _right _thing, even when doing the right
thing is hard, inconvenient, and counterintuitive to outsiders?

(Almost daily) I urge teams to take responsibility for their working
agreements, “process”, continuous improvement, and principles. No this is NOT
code or a design. But it is the best way, in my opinion, to advocate for
craft, sustainability, and not cutting corners. I am often asked to just “set
it up”. But I explain that you have to internalize and live these principles.
You can’t outsource it.

  1. Pull (don’t push) and limit work-in-progress
  2. Visualize things as they are
  3. Improve continuously

Stepping back further, there’s an almost zen-like quality to all this. It’s a
never-ending puzzle to solve. And some might argue (OK, I might argue) that it
is kind of fun.

* * *

### 1\. Pull (don’t push) and limit work-in-progress

Busyness is a drug. It’s heroic and pragmatic…a form of occupational theater.
Instead, embrace the challenge of focus and flow. This is the hard, and
disciplined work.

In a **WIP constrained system,** no individual or team is overloaded. You’re
at your optimal level of utilization. You work hard _and _smart.

In a **pull based system**, starting something MUST involve finishing
something else.

Together these create flow, and an opportunity to inspect and adapt.

### 2\. Visualize things as they are

What is actually happening? How are we working?

Visualize ideas, work, decisions, information, flow, allocation, blockers,
wins, losses, team energy, and experiments. Visualize everything. Get it out
of your head. Show don’t tell. Clarify working agreements.

We use whatever else it takes … to make the invisible things visible. And when
reality changes, we make that change visual. Always.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*A8N1I7p-SViOHf8s7d3fMQ.jpeg)

### 3\. Improve continuously

By limiting work-in-progress and visualizing everything (and measuring), we
can have the right conversations. The bottleneck emerges. And we chase it.

Have a conversation “at the board”. Where should we focus? What should we
amplify, and what should we dampen? Invite the elephant in the room out for
coffee. Make it safe.

Problems are opportunities, and everybody has ’em. Sense and seize those
opportunities.

_As a companion to this post (and to understand one of my key inspirations), I
recommend reading _[_The Principles of the Kanban Method by David
Anderson_](http://www.djaa.com/principles-kanban-method-0)_. I especially love
the principle “Start with what you do now.”_


# Change With No Change

Have you ever had this conversation with a friend (or your inner-self)?

### Change With No Change

Have you ever had this conversation with a friend (or your inner-self)?

How is work?

> There have been a ton of changes …

Has anything changed?

> No.

The odd thing is that **nothing actually changes**, but meanwhile **everything
is changing**!

**Nothing actually changes.** Poorly behaving (and performing) executives keep their jobs. Underfunded teams remain underfunded teams. There are no new investments in tooling, the deployment pipeline, testing environments, configuration management, etc. The CEO still jams silver bullets through the system. Incentive structures, titles, constraints, longtime exec feuds, how decisions are made, hiring practices, bad behavior, and toxic partnerships… all stay — the — same.

**But everything changes: **a re-org every month, shuffling teams, consultants, a “new strategy”, introducing copycat practices ([insert method X], lots of sticky notes, rotating managers, outsourcing, vague communications about culture, and a newfound myopic focus on a “do or die project” with a return to “business as usual” in a month or so.

It’s like changing your outfit every day to impress someone, but forgetting to
brush your teeth. Or buying a “3 Easy Installments of $99.00” exercise gizmo,
and not actually exercising.

You need something to actually CHANGE on a deep and lasting level:

  * Changes in external environment (e.g. competitive landscape)
  * Introduce new sources of information into the system
  * Change how information moves through the system
  * Change a behavior. Introduce a new behavior. Amplify/dampen a behavior. Learn and apply a new behavior
  * Automate an activity
  * Use new tools. Or use existing tools in different ways
  * Change code, architecture, design, process, patterns …”how things work”
  * Change how you allocate your focus, time, energy, and money
  * Add new sources of energy
  * Change how actors participate in the system (e.g. decision making, incentives, collaboration)
  * Change the actors in the system
  * Change “structure” (actor proximity, pattern of incentives, power flow, information flow,resource flow, actor relationships)
  * Change how you assess/frame progress

You get the idea.

Re-orgs may move people around, but they often fail to change how the actors
participate in the system. Adopting “Agile” may change how projects are
delivered, but it doesn’t impact which projects get prioritized. You pledge to
be customer-centric, but receive no new data regarding your customers.

Nothing angers and alienates employees more than a series of surface-
adjustments without an attempt to dig deeper. Experimenting with a clear goal
in mind (while engaging your team in the experiment) is a good thing.
Experimenting ON YOUR TEAM is not a good thing.

Or maybe even going up a level … change is what you might see as a RESULT of
you trying to intervene. The interventions themselves are not the changes …
the interventions are tactics. If the tactics produce no change…well, they’ve
failed.


# Stories and Epics

Nested hierarchies, boundaries, independence, and value…

* * *

### Stories and Epics

#### Nested hierarchies, boundaries, independence, and value…

#### Stories and Epics (and Independent Value)

  * **Story** = a story that is _small enough_ to fit into a sprint
  * **Epic** = a story that is _too big_ to fit into a sprint

In Scrum, Epics get broken down into Stories (because everything needs to fit
into a sprint). Stories should be valuable and independent ([see
INVEST](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/invest/)). And with that we
arrive at an apparent contradiction: if the Story rolls up to an Epic, is the
Story truly independent? And is the Story _independently valuable_? [Maybe,
but the value is
locked](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2014/march/stories-
versus-themes-versus-epics):

> While the stories that comprise an epic may be completed independently,
their **business value **isn’t realized until the entire epic is complete.

Hmmm. OK. So Story 1 below is _not_ independently valuable from a “business”
perspective (though may be extremely valuable from a learning standpoint,
which is certainly valuable to the business). Story 4 _is_ independently
valuable from a business perspective.

#### Potentially Releasable

If you’ve done Scrum training, you may have gotten stuck on reconciling the
use of Epics with the[ definition of a Sprint](https://www.scrum.org/resources
/what-is-a-sprint-in-scrum):

> A time-box of one month or less during which a “Done”, useable, and
**potentially releasable** product Increment is created.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WCOADvOAsH3L6cbHKPW6yQ.png)

The tricky phrase is “potentially releasable”. How can we have a _potentially
releasable product increment_ if some Stories are assigned to Epics, and Epics
— by definition — are too big to fit into a Sprint?

There’s an answer for this puzzle too! [Ken
Rubin](https://medium.com/u/e8471ec71422)(author of [Essential
Scrum](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Scrum-Practical-Addison-Wesley-
Signature/dp/0137043295)) contributed [this nugget to Google
Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scrumalliance/R55_NL1XSZQ):

> To be clear, “potentially shippable” does not mean that what got built must
actually be shipped. **Shipping is a business decision, which is frequently
influenced by things such as “Do we have enough features or enough of a
customer workflow to justify a customer deployment?” or “Can our customers
absorb another change given that we just gave them a release two weeks ago?”**

> Potentially shippable is better thought of as a state of confidence that
what got built in the sprint is actually done, meaning that **there isn’t
materially important undone work** (such as important testing or integration
and so on) that needs to be completed before we can ship the results from the
sprint, if shipping is our business desire.”

In [New Framework — the Increment,](http://ronjeffries.com/articles/017-08ff
/new-framework-increment/) [Ron Jeffries](https://medium.com/u/a45b68b1ab11)
defines The Increment (which matches up with Ken Rubin’s description):

> At regular intervals, preferably every week or two, the developers provide
an integrated, running, tested version of the software, the “Increment”,
containing all the features and capabilities **which have been completed so
far in the project**. The Increment must be in usable condition and must meet
all the agreed standards of completeness and correctness.

Summary: Some amount of value has been delivered (even if that value is
dependent on 1) other items being completed, 2) a function of the learning and
feedback that is now possible, and/or 3) the sheer act of pulling “something”
together that can be deployed). And in theory the work can be released.

#### Story Map

We decide it will be valuable to start selling subscription plans for our
Widget Service. Here’s how Epics, Releases, Increments, and Stories might look
using a User Story Map ([see here for more info](http://jpattonassociates.com
/user-story-mapping/)):

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Opg7f3O-QukvSRxNBtqq_g.png)

Note how these fit together:

  * We create a horizontal flow based on the user journey
  * We use **Stories** to focus our efforts on discreet bits of user-impacting functionality (feedback on these stories can be instantaneous and continuous)
  * We use **Increments** to regularly **inspect and adapt**
  * We use **Releases** to coordinate the decision to get something new in front of our users
  * We use **Epics** as a container for business value (or at least an assumption around business value)

#### Incremental Inspect/Adapt

Grasping the value of The Increment, the team decides to do a weekly review.
In a bout of experimentation, AcmeTeam drops their user story estimates, and
strives instead to make user stories as “small as possible, but no smaller”.
It’s like Scrum, but without worrying about a story point commitment/sprint
planning. Grafted on to a Kanban board it looks a bit like this:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aJetFdolRut-dhLDYyUs9A.png)

Not pretty (I prefer the Story Map), but still helpful.

Every Thursday the team commits to reviewing “the features and capabilities
**which have been completed so far in the project” (see Demo/Review).**
Depending on the week, this demo should cover 2–4 Stories. _Something _is done
and something is demoed. Now, it may not be the nice and neat Week 1 end-to-
end increment as described in the story-map, but it is _something_. Instead of
waiting until the end of next week — until it is _all done_ — the team gets
meaningful feedback.

> But, the demo will only make sense if four stories are demoed together!

Perhaps. Maybe the trick, then, is to schedule that demo the day those four
stories are done?

#### So What?

Where am I going with all this? Consider that our original definition of an
Epic was Sprint-constrained. But let’s remove Sprints from the equation.

At the end of the day, the central questions are:

  1. Can we break the problem down into **smaller, discreet problems**?
  2. What **boundaries** need to exist for the team to do its work? As PM, the boundary I might care about is end-to-end customer value. For a developer writing tests, something much more narrow is appropriate.
  3. How can we preserve the **relationships** (both hierarchal and adjacent)
  4. How do we make sure to **align the work with user outcomes/benefits**
  5. How do we **inspect and adapt** based on our progress?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6Wo2UheqK8Idyx7cO4bv6A.png)

Less experienced teams tend to get tripped up trying to define Epics, User
Stories, Task, and Sub Tasks. The reality is that software product development
is typically one big nested hierarchy, and a super messy one at that.
Additional tools — like maps, canvasses, designs, wireframes, logic diagrams —
are needed to hold the mental model together.

Managers foist all kinds of meaning on to “cards” — as requirements, for
scheduling, for accountability, to assign stuff to people, as units to measure
velocity —while losing their essential connectedness (and squeezing out
flexibility and customization for the task at hand).

You could probably do away with the words User Story and Epic altogether, and
use these instead:

  * Mountain
  * Hill
  * Boulder
  * Rock
  * Stone
  * Pebble
  * Grain

I’m only partly joking.

I’ll finish with a table that explains why it is so hard to settle on
“standard” definitions for how we describe our work. Our work is all over the
map below. Shared Understanding is hard. Great teams figure out how to keep
their mental model accurate.

### Stop Sprinting. Start Thinking.

OK. Your team has a choice…

  1. Here’s a prioritized list of stuff we need to tackle. Break down the work, **_and figure out what you can finish in the next two weeks_.** Let’s meet up in two weeks and reflect on where we are at.
  2. Here’s a prioritized list of stuff we need to tackle. Break down the work, **_pull from the top, and do your best._** Let’s meet up in two weeks and reflect on where we are at.

#### **Push-back to #2 typically involves variations of the following:**

  1. In #1 the team will be motivated to make their sprint commitment.
  2. It is nice to have something to shoot for. #1 gives you that.
  3. Developers need to learn how to deliver on their promises. #1.
  4. #1 shows that the developers can deliver predictably.
  5. How can we possibly forecast this project without doing #1?
  6. With #1 we’d deliver a cohesive thing for feedback.

#### I would argue that #2 can deliver software products equally well.

  1. You want your team to do their best. Delivering a pre-determined set of stories is not a great measure of doing your best. For example, you might hit a big glob of refactoring. It’s hard. With #1 you’ll miss your commitment, but be_ doing your best_.
  2. #2 does not preclude having goals. But it does give you the flexibility to decouple goals of different types: feedback/learning cycles, delivery cycles, etc.
  3. Many teams are “basically doing #2, but with estimates and a sprint goal… we don’t treat the stories as a commitment”. Hmmm. Ok.
  4. There’s an easy way to consistently deliver on promises (especially in a low trust environment)… simply under-commit. We don’t want that.
  5. Predictability, almost by definition, requires time to pass. There’s no reason why #2 can’t demonstrate a predictable flow of done work over time.
  6. The ability to forecast is highly influenced by factors unrelated to the time it takes to actually “do” the work (e.g. batch size, work in progress, hand-offs, tooling, environment consistency, reviews, multi-tasking, utilization rates, etc.) Both #1 and #2 can address these factors, **but #2 does so with less process overhead and abstraction.**

#### So What?

**My bias is clear. I like #2. However …**

**Here’s the important part. #1 and #2 are not all that different in terms of output/impact. Seriously, take a 30,000ft view. Are they?**

I can picture a **_healthy team_** pursuing both with the exact same effect.
Or for #1 to look more like #2 over time, and visa versa. If a team is
empowered to continuously improve (and has the scope of influence to remove
external blockers, and has psychological safety), they’ll find what is right
for them.

The problem, in my mind, is that #1 — and all the rituals behind it (story
point estimation, sprint “commitments”, burn-down/up charts, etc.)— are so
_easily abused_. Let’s face it: they ARE being abused, ALL the time. The goal
_is not_ to DO SCRUM™ and dance all the little dances. Rather, it is to
embrace continuous improvement and empirical process control (transparency,
inspection, and adaptation).

**There is nothing stopping your team reflecting on some cadence.**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*P_f_F9-gIEfQYYSi4JSvGQ.png)

**There is nothing stopping your team from setting meaningful goals.**

So my advice is to stop sprinting, and to start thinking (even if you end up
thoughtfully sprinting). Know the Why behind the various rituals. And make it
safe to experiment and learn.
