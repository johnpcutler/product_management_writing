### 8 Trends Shaping Modern Product Management

A brief post to list eight trends that are shaping modern product management.
This is based on my personal observations. Your observations may vary.

  1. **Rise of UX and “consumerification” of the enterprise**. Even for B2B the UX bar is set extremely high. “Just winging it” is not an option. Gone are the days when a PM can do double duty as an interaction designer, UX Researcher, information architect, and visual designer. Design thinking is being mentioned hand-in-hand with DevOps, organizational design, service design, and Agile itself.
  2. **Multiple touch-points.** You’re not just working on a desktop web browser. A typical product will have multiple touch-points including mobile, tablets, and even connected devices (“things”). Products integrate services from large and complex ecosystems. It’s a lot to process.
  3. **Lean Startup and LeanUX**. A focus on validated learning vs. big batches based on unvalidated assumptions. Product development is cast as an incremental learning process vs. a feature delivery process. Authors like [Jeff Gothelf](https://medium.com/u/94a2a063be85) and [Josh Seiden](https://medium.com/u/7f786c230ca9) (authors of [Lean UX: Applying Lean Principles to Improve User Experience](http://www.jeffgothelf.com/blog/lean-ux-book/#sthash.k2bQrJcw.dpbs)) stress a focus on “outcomes over features”. One of the most notable Lean Startup artifacts is the “MVP”. In its earliest incantation this was actually meant to be a Minimally Viable Product **Experiment. **It’s not truly viable to sell or market, but rather designed to elicit learnings and guide what will eventually be viable to users.
  4. **Increased customer/user community management demands. **Customers have countless touch-points through which to interact with your company. Consider the rise of companies like [Intercom](https://medium.com/u/7ca8972daf76) and others. While incredibly valuable, this can add a significant burden for already overextended product managers. An outward facing role is a necessity. But can a single person juggle that with internal facing demands?
  5. **Continuous delivery. **Teams are delivering high quality code more quickly and in smaller batches. Heavy release train management is less common. This is a double-edged sword. On one hand it limits batch size (and onerous release planning) which is almost always positive. On the other hand it increases demands on teams for rapid tactical product ownership and coordination.
  6. **Kanban and Post-Scrum Agile. **To support continuous delivery, teams are adopting new approaches (e.g. [Kanban Method](http://www.djaa.com/principles-kanban-method-0)) that challenge the traditional cadences of Scrum which in turn challenge traditional PO roles within Scrum. Accepting stories becomes near continuous. Grooming is ad-hoc based on demand. This presents a scheduling nightmares for the busy PM and further necessities a level of dedication and availability to the team.
  7. **Availability of data (both qualitative and quantitative) and ease of instrumentation. **Teams are swimming in data and new tools allow easy feature instrumentation. A Google PM ad lists the following qualification: “demonstrated ability to dive into quantitative and qualitative data and derive data-driven solutions.” Basic statistics, experiment design, ethnography, and general research methodologies are now essential product manager skills. It is becoming increasingly clear that to some extent we’re all guessing (sometimes educated guesses, but guesses nonetheless). The data side presents immense opportunities to build quickly, measure, and learn.
  8. **Expanded definitions of Agility. **There is a new focus on “whole organization” Agility vs. traditional Business/Team silos. Siloed teams require a “glue” role — aka Product Manager — to manage disparate stakeholders. Increasingly these barriers are falling to the wayside. In their place are autonomous business units with all the resources necessary for ideation, delivery, marketing, and revenue generation. The distance from the team to other stakeholders is shorter.

Below is an amazing infographic by Roman Pichler [available
here](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/romans-product-management-framework).
In pink I’ve indicated where the trends above impact traditional product
manager responsibilities. UX has firm influence in the “User Experience and
Product Backlog” sector. Lean Startup and LeanUX overlap “Strategy and Market
Research”. Continuous Delivery impacts roadmap creation and “key events” (aka
release planning / product lifecycle management). And data impacts multiple
areas.

So what does this all mean for product managers? I’ll save that for another
post. Please comment if you have anything to add.

### The System Thinking Change Agent Survival Guide

For my first post on Medium I wanted to cut straight to a topic that is rather
personal. It’s personal in the sense that I represent the personality type I’m
about to describe. It’s something I’ve come to peace with over the years but
the road has not been easy.

For the purpose of this post I’ll call the archetype **STCA (**Systems
Thinking Change Agent). It’s weird, I know, but it’ll have to do and I’ll
explain more below. I was tempted to call it just a Change Agent —the post
definitely has a change agent angle — but that wouldn’t fully describe the
personality.

For some perspective, when I was in 2nd grade I played the part of the
“Eternal Question” in our blockbuster play _Vernacular Island_. My costume was
a big question mark taped to a headband.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*OrSJKFXvexqC3Mx8-TOTVg.png)

The Eternal Question

### The Traits

So what does a STCA look like? How would you pick him/her out of a crowd? If
you’re a STCA you …

  * are intense, reasonably intelligent, and move and think quickly
  * are a systems thinker. [Systems thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking) “concerns an understanding of a system by examining the linkages and interactions between the elements that compose the entirety of the system”. For you, thinking this way is unavoidable
  * care deeply about people and don’t like to see them frustrated, thwarted, tense, stressed, or manipulated. This impacts you on a visceral level, you internalize it, and you take on these struggles as your own
  * have a growth mindset, and assume a growth mindset in others. [A growth mindset is](http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2015/11/16/growth-mindset-clearing-up-some-common-confusions/) “the belief that qualities can change and that we can develop our intelligence and abilities.” You assume (often incorrectly) that people are open to change, receptive to constructive feedback, and able to follow your logical reasoning and change direction as quickly as you
  * are passionate about the truth and discovering root cause (and various techniques to do this). Cognitive dissonance is unsettling and motivates you
  * are trusting in the basic good in people (you have faith that people can “come around” eventually)
  * are social and vocal and feel comfortable voicing what you are feeling/thinking. You’re an advocate
  * a natural problem solver with a lot of persistence, but lacking a certain level of political savviness

### Allergy Test

A good test for STCA-ism is whether you have a allergic reaction to any of the
following statements. Say them aloud, and see if you get hives or your heart
rate increases:

  * “Sometimes things are just political” or “Just because…”
  * “You’re over-thinking this”
  * “I’m not sure we can trust this information with those people …”
  * (A fellow coworker) “I gave up on trying to change that a long time ago”

Did any of these quotes trigger anything? If so, maybe you have some shades of
STCA-ism.

### The Pitfalls

As a STCA, sooner or later you’ll stumble into the following pitfalls. I know
because at some point or another I’ve been there. With the best of intentions
you go with your gut, lay it on the line, and things don’t end up working for
whatever reason.

**You’ll mistake people listening to you for people supporting you. **Most people are eager to hear new ideas and fresh perspectives… to a point. They might even thank you for “challenging [their] thinking”. But this doesn’t necessarily equal support or a willingness to act on that feedback. At a certain point it becomes “too much” and the mood shifts from openness to rejection and annoyance. **Solution:** Don’t assume listening correlates with support. And don’t assume — especially with email — that the lack of response equates to tacit understanding.

**You’ll quickly find allies but you’ll overestimate the number of people who really care.** Being vocal tends to attract likeminded people. Assuming that this sample is representative (at least in terms of how much they care) can be a costly mistake. Odds are that you’ve probably made contact with the minority of people who both notice and care enough about the issue. That doesn’t mean there aren’t others sympathetic to your effort (there most certainly are) but you can’t expect people to take too many risks. **Solution:** Don’t count on reinforcements until after you’ve reached the tipping point.

**You’ll assume others care as much as you do (and care about the same things).** “Care” is a loaded word. We’re conditioned to equate care with virtue, and may even consider ourselves virtuous for caring about or advocating for something. But people are wired in different ways. I know plenty of people who care deeply about certain aspects of work (e.g. the money, the facilities, the brand of coffee) but could care less about things like customers, culture, priorities, or ways of working. This doesn’t mean they wont express some passing interest in those topics, but rather that when the chips are down they’ll pass. **Solution:** Don’t use your level of concern or values as the benchmark. If anything, underestimate interest and intent.

**You’ll misunderstand “how things actually work”. **Like most systems,** t**he deeper story for an organization is rarely evident on first blush, and certainly defies value statement platitudes and the recruiting sales pitch. It can’t be fully understood by looking at an org chart, and can be difficult to triangulate by talking to a handful of people. Who really calls the shots? What do people really care about? What happens to people who question the status quo? What is the “real” culture? **Solution: **Use your systems thinking hat! Make a concerted effort to [map organizational dynamics](http://blog.strategyzer.com/posts/2015/10/13/the-culture-map-a-systematic-intentional-tool-for-designing-great-company-culture). Carefully observe to understand the culture as expressed through actions. Be honest about what the status quo optimizes for and whether that is conducive to your proposed change.

**You’ll think you’re the only one to notice the problem.** It’s easy to assume that the problem is obscured and if people could SEE the problem they’d be open to fixing the problem. More likely, the problem is clear and known to a more people than you’d think. Some are playing the long game (see below). Some people don’t really care enough to cause a fuss. Some people have alternative interpretations and/or political motivations. Don’t talk yourself into the “problem evangelist” role. It’s a losing game. **Solution:** Test for how other people perceive the problem. Test for their current tactics and approach. Then find a way to test whether you can enlist support.

**You’ll misunderstand why other people are not speaking out.** Your fellow change agents all may have similar motivations, but you may find yourself being the most vocal representative. Why? They know something you don’t know or sense something you don’t sense. It’s important to understand and respect where they’re coming from. They may have tried getting into the ring at some earlier point and were knocked out. Accept that this puts you in a somewhat precarious “kill the messenger” position. **Solution:** Empathy and understanding. Seek to understand their resistance to being more vocal. Try to distribute the pressure for change among more people.

**Your motives will be misunderstood. **Push beyond a certain point and you’ll be easily branded as a “too negative” or “only talking about problems”. Don’t be so quick to discount this feedback as you’d likely do the same thing if the tables were turned. Recognize that you’ve likely amped up the intensity level as you try to push through resistance. You’re responding to resistance, they’re responding to intensity, and so it goes. **Solution: **Do whatever possible to avoid the downward spiral. Be especially descriptive about your motives (building trust, continuous improvement, positive change, etc.)

**You’ll get caught playing the short game.** Some people play the short game and go down in a blaze of glory (or with luck into a lightning victory). Others methodically play the long game, chipping away at structures, forming alliances, and forging change. If you play the short game then you have to understand the risks involved (an organism attacked rejects threats). This may be fine — life is too short to continue doing something that brings you down — but realize what you’re getting into. And don’t judge the “long gamers”. It’s an individual decision. **Solution:** Decide in advance whether you are willing to play the price for playing the short game. It’s a gamble. To quote Kenny Rogers:

> You’ve got to know when to hold ‘em  
> Know when to fold ‘em  
> Know when to walk away  
> Know when to run

**You’ll overestimate the power of bottom-up change. **Bottom-up change is extremely difficult. [At a certain point you hit the glass ceiling of established systems and structures.](http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/index.php?title=Larman%27s_Laws_of_Organizational_Behavior) After any period of time those structures become rigid, self-perpetuating, and extremely difficult to “nudge”. Even Herculean individual efforts fail here. So be prepared. Consider the long game. **Solution: **Be honest with yourself about the feasibility of bottom-up change. Work tirelessly to influence someone with the power to enact far reaching change. Consider the long-game.

**You’ll assume that people have the same change vision.** Even in cultures that stress continuous improvement it is common for individuals and groups to jockey for ownership of change efforts. On the surface you may see openness to change. But if you peel away the layers you’ll find competing visions for change. Realize that people may agree that change is required, but be split on tactics. In my experience this is the norm. The problem typically isn’t the problem, but rather the competition for who solves it (and how). **Solution: **Map the various efforts to address the problem. Understand who shares your perspective. Understand where there is tension.

### Now What?

I’m the last person to suggest that you become someone who you aren’t. The
first thing to realize is that your experience will be highly org/culture
specific. This is absolute key to understand. For most STCAs there is no
reigning us in. It’s an ingrained mindset. Finding the right culture and
environment is key.

Much of what you read online about change is written from the perspective of
consultants and managers. This is top-down and outside-in change and not
bottom-up change. But resistance is resistance, and it will always be a
factor. The reality is that from this vantage point you’ll do no good winning
even the majority of hearts, unless they care very, very deeply about the
cause. The only path to success — and remember that SOME people are able to be
successful — is through a disciplined tightrope walk. Without that, you may
even succeed in terms of getting the ball rolling, but you’ll have a miserable
time of it.

The hardest thing for STCAs to come to grips with is that politics, influence,
and maneuvering are requirements for change in most orgs (short of an all out
revolt, or mass exodus). You don’t have to be disingenuous, but you will have
to work the people angle.

Assume that everyone is “on the same side”, but don’t assume deep trust from
the outset. Probe, test, observe, map, and ask questions. Understand the
resistance on a deep level before confronting it. Spend time with people who
don’t share your mindset. Slow down to speed up.

  * Develop a clear vision and boil it down to its essence
  * “Be the change” in whatever way possible. Lead with results
  * Learn how to have [crucial conversations](http://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Edition/dp/1469266822)
  * Patience and persistence
  * Develop strong relationships, even with those you disagree with

That’s about it for now. Do you have any other tips? Did this resonate on any
level? Let me know in the comments below.

### 7 Tips For Better Prototypes

I love developing prototypes. I love the challenge of teasing out insights
with a[super low-fidelity
prototype](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/10/06/the-skeptics-guide-to-
low-fidelity-prototyping/). Most of all I like keeping prototypes squarely
focused on reducing risk, and making sure the process benefits the customer.

Too often I feel like the prototyping process becomes a blocker unto itself.
Competing goals muddy the waters, confirmation bias rules the roost, and
feature creep turns a throwaway prototype into a big undertaking.

Below are a couple thoughts on how to keep the prototyping process free from
bias, and focused squarely on the needs of your customers.

### 1\. Decide On A Driver

Is the prototype designed to elicit meaningful feedback? We build prototypes
because we lack decision-making information. A shotgun approach makes it
difficult to filter the signal from the noise. Consider instead building
multiple prototypes that individually address key areas of uncertainty. Decide
on a driver. Is your goal to experiment with different technical approaches?
Are you validating usability, adoptability, or business value? Prototypes
don’t multi-task well. “All of the above” is not a great answer. Stick to a
single driver, and at most a “nice to have” side benefit.

### 2\. Defeat Confirmation Bias

Ask how the data you intend to gather will ultimately change your behavior.
Most people assume they’ll “just know” when they’ve nailed a feature. Right
off the bat that thought process is setting in motion a strong confirmation
bias. As I’ve mentioned in previous posts, there is a big difference between
exploratory testing (where you’re looking for unexpected failures and
successes) and validation tests that are designed to validate a system is
working correctly.

Can you move the needle with a single, low-lift enhancement? That would be a
good one to try first because an affirmative response would be surprising, and
therefore valuable. Also, consider having someone with less skin in the game
lead the validation efforts with users. You might already be too close to your
solution.

### 3\. Throwaway Prototype?

Are you willing to throw away your prototype and start over? Make it clear if
you’re building a [throwaway prototype](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-
prototype-pitfall/) meant to be discarded, or an [evolutionary
prototype](http://www.exforsys.com/career-center/project-management-life-cycle
/the-evolutionary-prototyping-model.html) meant to be refined and rebuilt into
the final solution. The middle ground is not a great place to be. A throwaway
prototype lets you work quickly and focus on the big, risky unknowns. An
evolutionary prototype focuses on better understood features and delays
decisions on less clearly understood features. If you are juggling unknowns
AND knowns in a single feature, then consider running two prototyping tracks
in parallel.

### 4\. Simplicity

Don’t prototype a more complex feature, when a simpler feature might achieve
the same effect. Why? Even cheap complex features can have an adverse effect
on the user experience and make future iterations more difficult.

### 5\. Small and Timeboxed

Keep the team small and [timebox](http://www.techwell.com/2014/01/use-
timeboxing-boost-your-efficiency) your efforts. The value of prototyping is
that you discover information quickly and cheaply. All too often this turns
into a prototyping death march, where vague feedback triggers a never-ending
escalation of complexity, minor iterations, and increasingly vague and
misleading feedback. Don’t go there! Cut it short. Don’t expand the scope
because you lack clear feedback. If anything, remove variables. Stick to
discreet questions and areas of uncertainty.

A small expeditionary force keeps you lean, and defeats analysis paralysis. A
timebox keeps you focused, and forces you to paint with a limited palette.

### 6\. Tweaking vs. Prototyping

Differentiate optimization/tweaking from prototyping. Are you 90% of the way
there? Then by all means release your feature and tweak. Are there large,
lingering areas of uncertainty? Then continue to prototype. The team should
have a solid sense of turning the corner before releasing code to a broad
user-base. The larger sample size will help when it comes to optimizing and
detecting small differences. But processing broad feedback at scale can be
difficult. And why wait that long to root out problems that can be more easily
and cheaply caught earlier in the process? Broad strokes first. Fine print
last.

### 7\. Have A Plan

Don’t pressure teams into prototyping for the wrong reasons. I’ve caught
myself in the past using the “fail fast / learn” mantra to justify cranking
out poorly planned prototypes. The reality was that I wanted something sexy to
show customers, and that I didn’t really have a plan for testing my
assumptions. Don’t let this happen. Have a plan. Engage with your team to
uncover what is blocking data-driven decision making, and together plan the
prototype. If you are making the executive decision to “just start building”,
then at least be transparent about that.

Let me know what you think in the comments below! Happy prototyping!

### Inside My Kindle: 100 Books For PMs, UX, Entrepreneurs, Systems Thinkers,
Design Thinkers, and Other Crazies (Like Me)

I’m a product development nut. And I’m a book junkie. I love this stuff. I
recently moved to Raleigh, NC (from always blissful Santa Barbara, CA) to work
at [Pendo.io](http://www.pendo.io/), a startup focused on helping product
managers build awesome products. You can find me on Twitter at
[@johncutlefish](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish).

It occurred to me today that my Kindle collection was starting to get pretty
large. Poking around Amazon I realized that you can actually get a list of all
your purchased books. It isn’t a perfect list (the titles are cut off), but it
gives you enough information to find the book. The kicker was getting an email
from a friend asking for some book recommendations. So I decided to share the
current state of the book list with her (and you).

This covers the topics that interest me: _leadership, UX, startups, cognitive
bias, product management, Agile, management, complexity theory, marketing,
design thinking, system thinking, data, analytics, hypothesis-driven
development, product development, self-improvement, communication,
organization design, lean, kanban, collaboration, and generally figuring out
ways groups of people can continuously improve and build useful stuff_.

I’ve read each of these books. I’m a big believer that there is never a magic
bullet. None of these books presents the definitive “way”. Where there is a
“why” (and inspiration, and rigor, and an open mind), there are a host of
tools that can help get you there. Choose wisely.

# Dr. Obvious, Startup Validation, and Failure

“Validating” your startup is a big buzz word lately. Heck, all you need is
five minutes and a napkin. I think the term is misused.

* * *

### Dr. Obvious, Startup Validation, and Failure

“Validating” your startup is a big buzz word lately. Heck, [all you need is
five minutes and a napkin](http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/validate-your-
startup-idea-in-5-minutes-or-less.html). I think the term is misused.

**Validation **is doing tests for which you are trying to confirm some piece of information. **Exploratory** tests involve doing tests for which you gain value with both failures and successes. The difference is absolutely critical for startups. Simply validating commonly known information does little to produce privileged information. The real winners discover that twist: the UI that drives adoption, the untapped enterprise market, or the untested viral growth strategy. Why waste valuable resources on proving the known?

You are approaching validation (or what I prefer to call exploration)
correctly if you get negative responses (failures) about 50% of the time. In
the exploratory stage the most valuable learnings come with unexpected
failures and unexpected successes.

Why? In _The Principles of Product Development Flow: Second Generation Lean
Product Development_, Donald G. Reinertsen shows the following graph to
demonstrate that the average information generated by such a test is a
function of its failure rate:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*XRVALKugCEUqoy4O.jpg)

This should look familiar to engineers as the theoretical basis behind the
binary search algorithm, but for the rest of us Reinertsen explains:

> The equation in Figure 4–6 shows that the information content of a test
comes from the degree of surprise associated with each possible result. Any
unexpected success has high information content, as does any unexpected
failure. Unfortunately, most companies do a far better job of communicating
their successes than their failures. They carefully document successes, but
fail to document failures. This can cause them to repeat the same failures.
Repeating the same failures is waste, because it generates no new information.
Only new failures generate information.

The takeaway? At first, do more exploring and less validating. You are
attempting to purchase information, and to maximize the value of that
information you must design tests that fail as often as they succeed.

**Easy Test:** “Hand entering those receipts must be pretty painful huh?”

**Hard Test:** “Will you sign a year long contract for $22,000 if I can solve that problem for you?”

If every interview confirms your core assumption(s), then you are likely
asking the wrong questions, or you are simply eliciting “known” information
that is shared broadly and not particularly valuable. Like drug companies you
are looking to perform tests that have unexpected results driving asymmetric
payoff functions — not simply validating what is known, or failing for
failure’s sake.

For example, almost everyone finds taxes, losing weight, balancing your
checkbook, and home buying painful. This is why there are such large
industries around solving those problems. A company like
[Mint](https://www.mint.com/) didn’t need to validate that home budgeting was
difficult. Rather, it needed to validate that you could disrupt with
automation, bank relationships, take advantage of new bank APIs, and that
there was a critical tipping point in terms of willingness to share financial
data.

Some problems / pains are incredibly clear and poignant — they’ve been around
for a long time — but the solution is elusive because you’ve got an
“integration” problem. For example, take the music business. Everyone knew it
was broken. Countless startups tried to address the problem. But it was Apple
who side-stepped the integration / coordination problem.

Additionally, very few validation efforts take sufficient measures to avoid
“leading the witness”. The [confirmation
bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) is in full effect, and
we likely only hear what we want to hear. We are literally “validating”
ourselves vs. figuring how where there is an angle for a business.

Most pain is known. The trick is timing, understanding sea changes in terms of
user habits, unraveling integration issues to force disruption, and developing
faster/cheaper ways to do things. Write some scripts, stop leading the
witness, and make sure your interviews are challenging your assumptions as
often as they are confirming your assumptions.

### Life, Death, Continuous Improvement, and Continuous Disruption

I’ve been thinking about (and hearing about) continuous improvement a lot
lately. This past weekend I had the pleasure of attending my first [Agile Open
event in Berkeley, CA](http://agileopencalifornia.com/northern_ca.html). The
experience was rewarding on multiple levels. Within a couple hours I had
become part of an instant community of fellow Agile-nerds. Together we
spontaneously created a 30 session 2-day
[unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference). And the supportive
community helped me tackle topics I have been struggling with lately.

The following covers some new thoughts on continuous improvement inspired by
Agile Open. New friends [Rob
Carstons](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAAADF654BEZ7kgRiR-
xxVME4TBa2_XgL4sA4&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=rCbS&locale=en_US&trk=tyah&trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2CclickedEntityId%3A12970910%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1444631892156%2Ctas%3AROB%20CAR),
and Chris Young really helped me germinate a vague idea into something more
solid.

As Pablo Picasso once said, “every act of creation is at first an act of
destruction.” Continuous improvement exists against a backdrop of atrophy,
entropy, decay, adaptation, expansion, growth, evolution, and disruption.

Consider mitosis and apoptosis. With mitosis, cells divide and growth occurs.
When a tissue or organ reaches the right size, the process slows. With injury
(necrosis) or periods of growth, the process accelerates. Apoptosis, on the
other hand, describes healthy cell suicide. The Greek word apoptosis refers to
the “dropping off” of petals and leaves from plants and trees. When a tadpole
becomes a frog it loses its tail. Billions of cells die in our intestines
every hour. The human hand begins as a solid blob until the cells separating
our fingers undergo apoptosis. And insufficient apoptosis results in
uncontrolled cell proliferation (such as with cancer).

Continuous improvement is not a simple act of addition, and neither is growth.

At least from the perspective of shareholders, growth is key in the current
tech landscape. [A 2007 McKinsey research report titled Grow Fast or Die
Slow](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/grow_fast_or_die_slow)describes
the advantages afforded to high-growth companies:

  * They offer a 5x return to shareholders compared to medium-growth companies
  * The fastest growers (&gt;60% when they reached $100 million in revenues) were 8x more likely to reach $1 billion in revenues than those growing less than 20%
  * They succeed despite margin or cost structure

This ecosystem is extremely volatile and out of equilibrium, with rapid
technological change, cultural shifts, and cutthroat competition for
resources. Growth is the goal; it has big advantages like greater
capitalization, market share, mind share, and access to resources. But like
the human cells above, the entrepreneurial muscles and tissues we create and
grow exact a high metabolic overhead. Information flow is reduced. We spend
more to manage dependencies and integration. We must eat and digest more
resources to survive.

It’s not just about growth either: all players in the ecosystem are facing
eventual disruption and extinction (see Joseph Schumpeter’s concept of
[creative destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction)).
Every day of growth and existence involves a potential parallel path of decay
and atrophy. In this context, continuous improvement isn’t merely about
keeping our skills up to snuff, or honing the rough edges of our Agile rituals
and practices. It’s about survival. The dynamics of adaptation and evolution
are the same, but the pace is massively accelerated.

Let me present the basic model we developed and played around with at Agile
Open.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*EZrEwRg_8zTn0KaC.png)

How does this work? Let’s start out with the basics:

  1. In **Steady State** we are not improving, but we may be using newly improved capacities
  2. With **Disruption** we experience a change in the equilibrium. We experience a stressor from an internal or external source
  3. The first response is **Pain**
  4. Pain reveals information. And we **Learn**
  5. Learning leads to potential **Improvements**
  6. We reach a local optima and move to a **Steady State**

We have four primary loops with three not-so-ideal end states:

  1. **Disruption** and **Pain** predominate when we first encounter the stressor. If the stressor is large, then it leads to Death. The disruption and pain was too great
  2. If we are in **Pain**, we may continue to **Learn**. But if we can’t translate that into Improvements then we will eventually reach Death. We are stuck in a downward spiral not being able to apply our learning.
  3. When we combine **Learning** with **Improvement **we have a virtuous cycle that lets us translate disruption driven information into improvements. Eventually we’ll reach a local optima
  4. Finally, in the **Steady State loop** we can simply “ride it out” for some period of time. Without further disruption we risk descending into a cycle of complacency, and finally Death.

This cycle is experienced on the individual, team, product, organization,
industry, cultural, and multi-cultural level. Some examples:

**Individual. **We first exist in the womb, a decently safe steady-state. Birth is a form of painful disruption. We learn and adapt. Hit plateaus. And continue through the cycle. If we suffer a grave injury then we are disrupted and stuck in the pain cycle, and may die. If we get stuck in a steady-state, then we struggle with a form of atrophy and death. We work to improve our work environment until a certain point where things plateau. And if things stay there we get restless and then disrupt ourselves and find a new job.

**Organization**. After a period of smooth sailing our industry is disrupted due to an important cultural shift. If the disruption is too harsh, we die. If we live, we learn and adapt, and improve.

**Teams.** Team formation is a form of disruption. Hopefully we push through to a period of learning. We get diminishing returns from our improvement efforts. Cruise a bit. And then disrupt ourselves.

**Products. **Products are initially disruptive. We go through a period of optimization (learn / improve), and then move to maintenance mode. It is at this point that we either disrupt ourselves with a new offering, or let the competition do that for us.

In a single culture (and organization) you can have multiple parties moving at
different speeds through this loop. Consider the example of the tenured
engineer who starts getting bored due to fewer challenges, more rules, and
less flexibility. They have achieved steady state. While the company is happy
with the steady state, they are unaware that it is leading to complacency. Our
engineer starts to get an itchy trigger finger. Either they will disrupt
themselves and leave the company, or the company will respond.

Or the organization with leadership that can see the impending threat but has
trouble inspiring a sense of urgency. Or the sector within the larger global
landscape that is on the forefront of disrupting the incumbents.

With this model in mind, we can take a broader view of continuous improvement.
Let us discuss the key levers an Agile Coach could use to impact flow through
this cycle:

  * Assess the states of individuals, teams, the organization, industry, and broader culture (if working internationally). Where are they in the cycle? Do they realize where they are?
  * Preserve the safety of Steady State when it is helpful and when it help consolidate gains
  * Move people out of steady state to Disruption at the right time
  * Sense Pain quickly, soften pain of disruption, and shift quickly to Learning
  * Facilitate the Learn/Improvement cycle
  * Realize when a local optima has been reached for local improvement and push ahead

So let’s get back to continuous improvement. Gary Hamel refers to flexibility
as “planned adaptation” for the “expected” and agility as “unplanned
adaptation” to the “unexpected”. Flexibility, therefore, requires the ability
to see the future which is rather difficult. Agility assumes an unknown
future.

In the [Quest for Resilience](https://hbr.org/2003/09/the-quest-for-
resilience) Hamel writes:

> Strategic resilience is about having the capacity to change before the case
for change becomes desperately obvious. An accelerating pace of change demands
an accelerating pace of strategic evolution, which can be achieved only if a
company cares as much about resilience as it does about optimization

He continues:

> The goal is a company where revolutionary change happens in lightning-quick,
evolutionary steps — with no calamitous surprises, no convulsive
reorganizations, no colossal write-offs, and no indiscriminate, across-the-
board layoffs. In a truly resilient organization, there is plenty of
excitement, but there is no trauma.

Hamel’s version of resilience is similar to Nassim Taleb’s “antifragility”.
Antifragile systems are not merely robust — able to withstand threats — but
actually thrive in volatile environments.

With all this in mind, I want to propose a broader vision for continuous
improvement that extends beyond surfacing and fixing sprint impediments and
eeking the final 10% of craft competence out of a team. It’s the part of the
puzzle that many companies miss when they buy into an Agile transformation
only to be stymied with the next seismic shift in their industry.

Continuous improvement is the response to the drumbeat of atrophy and carrying
dead weight. And it works hand in hand with continuous disruption. Basic
process improvement and optimization relies on a repeatable future. Continuous
improvement addresses a deeper need.

The goal of continuous improvement is to, at a minimum, grow today while
remaining as Agile as you were yesterday. And even better: to increase that
Agility during growth. This is not optimization. This is resilience.

In a sense that is what Agile Open was to me personally. A bit of disruption
(a friend recommended that I attend and take the plunge), some initial pain
understanding the format and getting comfortable, learning, improvement,
reflection in the form of this post, and now I’m off to the steady-state
(bed). Cheers!

What comes to mind first …. **love the problem and sense the impact.**

People focus myopically on craft and perfection when there is not obvious
evidence for the impact of their work. And you can’t really blame them.
Sensing impact feels good. It makes you feel better about the corners you
might have cut — that delta between perfect and what works. But when you lack
that sense of impact it is easy to focus on what you can control (craft, and
“doing it right”).

I’ve heard it from engineers, product, and UX alike for years. “At the end of
the day I can just dig into the architecture”. “When all else fails I can
focus on design patterns.” “Just ship it”. From that angle, you can say that
the role of the product manager is to help the team fall in LOVE with a
customer/user/business (hopefully all three) problem AND then do whatever
possible to guide the team towards a sense of real IMPACT (not success
theater, not made up metrics, not “on to the next thing”, but something that
passes intellectual and emotional muster.)

> help the team fall in LOVE with a customer/user/business (hopefully all
three) problem AND then do whatever possible to guide the team towards a sense
of real IMPACT.

This can be through “hard” skills (qual data, quant data, customer interviews,
experiment design, competitive analysis, good story writing, analysis,
decision making frameworks, plain old experience) and also through “soft”
skills like communication, motivation, leadership, empathy, focus, time
management, clarity, etc.

So **LOVE THE PROBLEM and SENSE OF IMPACT.** If you just do the former, you’ll
have a sad team.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*uoHuvdHS5MgiTz7D3Y-wGQ.jpeg)

DailyMailUK

They’ll love the problem, but have no sense they’re solving it. If you only do
the latter, and they **don’t **love the problem, and only see KPIs, then that
wont make a difference either.** It is LOVE and IMPACT**. Cheesy, I know. In
both of these cases it is easy to go back to craft. As professionals mature,
this becomes harder and harder. Simply shipping, or the perfect architecture,
or the perfect pattern become tired goals. As you develop professionally, so
does the desire for a real sense of validated impact.

Finding that balance requires creative problem solving, even if the “official”
problem solving isn’t in the PMs court. Problem definition requires problem
solving. And they also take speaking the language of the other parties
involved. You have to be (at a minimum) quad lingual (customer, engineering,
UX, and business).

IMO, one cop out is the “healthy tension” concept. In that model, you’ll have
the various silos fight it out and the solution will magically end up settling
somewhere in the mundane middle. No risks taken. No real fulfillment from the
team on a job well done. It is really a battle of the guesses. This is a
“spray and pray” model. You’re relying on the battle and tension to somehow
yield the best path forward. This doesn’t feel healthy to me, and doesn’t
compete with a motivated team (Love), moving with a sense of Impact.

At my previous job I was asked what would motivate me after a day of work as a
PM (I was a UX Researcher at the time). And here was my answer … which pretty
much sums up my post above:

> _I would leave the engineers I work with _**_incredibly psyched about what
they were working on, able to see the potential impact, comfortable with the
risks, and confident with the direction we were taking together_**_. They’d
have “flow”, and so would I. I’d connect them to the data and insights that
would help them understand, on a deep level, the problem our customers were up
against, as well as the business objective. Importantly, I’d “do” things …
there would be tickets in Pivotal for their requests, and they’d always feel I
was pulling my weight. This could be very practical and mundane stuff but I
wouldn’t mind: designing a survey, processing feedback, arranging calls with
customers, doing competitive analysis, data analysis, doing lo-fi usability
tests with a customer and iterating rapidly, etc. During that day I would have
taken something very gnarly and diffuse, and helped boil it down into 3 clean
bullets that somehow had a unifying effect on the project. Go from complex to
actionable._

Of course, this all goes with your “day job” of knowing your customers/users
better than they understand themselves, and really tapping into their story
and job. But such is the life of a PM!


# Sticky Love — Choosing Between Physical Boards and Online Tools

I say both.

### Sticky Love — Choosing Between Physical Boards and Online Tools

#### I say both.

**tl;dr: Consider using both. Leverage online tools for what they do best.**

The [physical board vs. online tool
debate](http://pm.stackexchange.com/questions/8711/what-is-better-a-physical-
scrum-board-or-an-online-board) has been a staple of my career for 5–8 years
now. It changes form occasionally, and with each year there are new twists,
but for the most part it has remained exactly the same. I’d put it up there
with debates on wikis, ticketing systems, roadmap tools, and [chat
clients](http://bunnyinc.com/blog/communication-tools-bunny-inc-hipchat-
sqwiggle-google-sites-lost-us-slack-yammer-confluence).

So instead of repeating myself with each new instance of the debate, I’m just
going to get my opinion out in one post. Below I’ve described some of the key
advantages of physical boards and online tools. And then I go on to describe
my preferred portfolio of three physical and non-physical tools. I’d love to
hear your experiences in the post comments. What has worked for you?

Do physical boards scale? Sure. But I’m not a fan of scaling Agile (see
[Jurgen Appelo](https://medium.com/u/79df0d151f0e) and [No. Agile Does Not
Scale](https://medium.com/@jurgenappelo/no-agile-does-not-scale-
98df99da3ff3#.mv642sbw5) ). More than 100 people trying to work on the same
product and mission should descale and focus on more defined and individual
impactful goals IMO.

OK, let’s get started. By the way I had a seriously hard time deciding between
using “online”, “digital”, “virtual”, “electronic”, or “software” for non-
physical tools. So I settled on the imperfect “online”.

### Physical Boards are great for:

  * Changing workflow on the fly to meet new challenges
  * Supporting and promoting continuous improvement
  * Supporting complex workflows that are difficult / inflexible to model with tools
  * Creative customization (mission, magnets, blocker flags, etc.)
  * Improving team collaboration, communication, and interaction (for collocated teams). See Tom Wujec’s [TED Talks](https://medium.com/u/628458d920a9) on visual problem solving:

  * Include [items for UX](http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/80914/where-do-you-put-your-ux-and-ui-stories-in-your-agile-framework) (and other non-engineers) that are awkward to include in an online system
  * Team standups. The large canvas keeps the [focus on the work](http://brodzinski.com/2011/12/effective-standups.html) (also see [this post](https://medium.com/@alexander.byndyu/standups-in-kanban-style-b80b54dc1c33#.y0phv5ul5) from [Alexander Byndyu](https://medium.com/u/3e72dfc4914d) )
  * Adding upstream and downstream stages without clouding an online tool. When you deliver a feature is it truly “done”?
  * Taking [screen breaks](http://www.inc.com/neil-patel/when-how-and-how-often-to-take-a-break.html) to improve focus, creativity, and energy levels
  * Easy work decomposition (“let’s just create another card”)
  * Discovering tool requirements before purchasing a tool
  * Preventing measurement dysfunction. Not all metrics from online tools are applicable in all situations, and many are abused
  * Boards can accommodate theme, epic, and story level views simultaneously which aids in mentally connecting epics and their stories

### Online Tools are great for:

  * Asynchronous collaboration like comments, attachments, and notes
  * Integrations to third party tools (source control, devops, Slack, etc.)
  * Remote collaboration and being [inclusive to remote team members](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/243795)
  * Home and travel access for co-located teams
  * More established and stable workflows
  * Teams that can afford [extra large monitors for standups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH-pczZY8MU&feature=player_embedded)
  * Intra-company collaboration across functional teams (e.g. support, success, c-suite)
  * Automatically capturing metrics and generating reports (assuming these actually drive value for you)’
  * Work decomposition (“I’ll just type up a new card, and we wont have 200 cards up on that whiteboard”)
  * Encouraging edits to existing cards
  * Handling lots of cards / tickets

Online Kanban Board (source: <http://leankit.com/blog/2013/12/seeing-big-
picture/>)

(see also [here](http://blog.nwcadence.com/kanban-boards-physical-or-
virtual/), [here](http://www.agileweboperations.com/kanban-boards-physical-or-
electronic), [here](http://toolsforagile.com/blog/archives/762/5-reasons-why-
physical-boards-are-better-than-electronic-boards), and
[here](http://jacoporomei.com/news/virtual-physical-the-best-of-two-worlds-
for-our-kanban-board/)) for more Physical vs. Online posts

My favorite approach is something that combines the advantages of both.
Mirroring the boards feels like overkill. It really isn’t necessary for day to
day operations. But the advanced collaboration and integration capabilities of
online tools are essential.

The problem with online tools is that they so quickly become unusable and
bloated with repeated customizations. What starts with three stages becomes
five stages. Projects multiply. Views multiply. The backlog has 500 items, and
half of the authors have left the company. And most people come to eventually
hate the tool (I’ve had teams hate Jira, Rally, Fogbuz, Pivotal, Bugzilla,
etc.) [You always end up hating the digital
tool](https://twitter.com/henrikkniberg/status/256055433045880832) …

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*n2M-r4OYkMu8g6lbuiYhmw.png)

Not sure what he thinks now …

With that in mind, my favorite combination is something like:

  1. A **physical board** to promote continuous improvement and collaboration along with a [**stamp**](http://www.amazon.com/Traditional-Digit-Rubber-Number-RN018/dp/B001A42CME) to number the tickets on the physical board. Multiple teams might want to incorporate a [portfolio Kanban board](http://brodzinski.com/2012/05/project-portfolio-kanban-better-board.html).
  2. A **ticketing system** with MINIMAL customization (three ticket stages, and assigning ticket to a team member), used primarily for the third party integrations and asynchronous collaboration. I like [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira). But a ton of products will do the job here
  3. A **note-taking app** ([Evernote](https://evernote.com/?var=3)) or loose Kanban board ([Trello](https://trello.com/)) for collecting, tagging, and organizing customer feedback, notes, research, etc.

Why? Each does what it does well:

  1. **Physical Board:** Continuous improvement, effective standups, and radiating information
  2. **Online Ticketing:** Asynchronous collaboration and integrations
  3. **Online Note-Taking / Loose Kanban:** Search, organization, tagging, exploring connections (see this [wonderful video from Mailchimp’s Aaron Walter describing how they use Evernote](https://vimeo.com/89520398))

I’d throw in a good chat client (Slack maybe?), because used well it actually
reduces the number of costly distractions.

The pitfall of most tools is that they try to do too many things well. This is
the bane of most online tools after 6–12 months of use and customization.

Together these systems take advantage of each tool’s strength while avoiding
the weaknesses. A common trap with tools is that we tend to notice the
deficiencies because they slap us in the face (“I have to walk over there and
WRITE on that INDEX CARD!” or “What do you mean this doesn’t integration with
Salesforce”) while the advantages are more subtle. Our expectation is that
everything should be easy without acknowledging that most optimizations in one
direction (e.g. information showing up in multiple systems) involve a
sacrifice in another direction (e.g. sacrificing flexibility, and creativity).

The [note-taking app is an important componen](http://alistapart.com/article
/connected-ux)t because both physical boards and online ticketing systems
break down when you add 600 item backlogs. Neither are a good repository for
ideas and lack the rapid search / access of Evernote or loose organization and
workflow of Trello. Google Docs and Sheets work, but they become unwieldy with
any amount of scale.

Some tips / guidelines:

  * Again, minimal customization of the ticketing tool. Think of this as the ticket repository
  * Always feel free to customize the physical board. That’s why you’re going to the trouble!
  * The stamp is clutch for keeping track of things. An alternative would be printing simple QR codes or barcodes that could integrate with the ticketing system (using a mobile app, for example)
  * Consider taking a photo of the Kanban board periodically (1x or 2x per day) for your remote team members. Or better yet [rig up a time lapse photo](http://www.all-things-photography.com/time-lapse-photography/)
  * Open up the note-taking tool as broadly as possible across the organization. You want everyone to feel comfortable contributing
  * Consider a second physical board for roadmap / portfolio planning

That’s about it. What do you think? What has worked for you and your team?

# 104 Questions For Product Development Teams

hate me and call me crazy.

### 104 Questions For Product Development Teams

**Please bookmark this post. Don’t try to read it all in one sitting. You will hate me and call me crazy.**

It will not go well with your coffee. You will get distracted, and if you are
a product manager it will likely trigger some anxiety. I could have written
this in 10 posts, but I figured it would be easier to keep it all in one
place.

After bookmarking the post, please do the following:

**1.** Email it to a trusted co-worker with one of these subject lines:

  * “What goes on in a product manager’s brain …. “
  * “Before we start the next project … “
  * “This is why I need a vacation … “
  * “Answering these questions can make our engineers happy … “

**2.** Read the introduction, and then browse ten (10) questions to get the gist. Then return to it when you’re in a bind, need to reality check your situation, or want some ideas on how to give your team more clarity.

### Introduction

Let’s get started. To quote [one of my favorite posts on the role of product
management](https://medium.com/@joshelman/a-product-managers-job-
63c09a43d0ec), the product manager’s job is to:

> Help your team (and company) ship the right product to your users

Simple right? Hardly. I like to think that product helps the team (both the
immediate “doers” and the broader team) achieve a state of Flow for the
benefit of your company and users. [Wikipedia defines Flows
as](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29):

> … the [mental state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_state) of operation
in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of
energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the
activity.

Apathy, boredom, and anxiety are Flow anti-patterns. Clear goals, tight
feedback loops, and the absence of blockers are Flow state prerequisites.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*h332lIEr3yb8sR3R.jpg)

And they also happen to fit squarely in a product manager’s job description.
In short, help the team focus all of its energy on driving value directly to
the users/customers. Do “everything else”. And do so in situations that are
often ambiguous and constantly changing. Servant leadership (without the
authority) at its best.

Below I have documented 104 questions (@250 if you count the questions inside
the questions) that I ask myself during an average day, week, month, and year.
They revolve mostly around the internal facing role of product and promoting
Flow. For some of these questions, it is my responsibility to have the answer.
The team deserves no less. For others, I guide the team towards self-
discovery. Either way, the focus is on clarity, and a clear path forward.

### Team and Situation

What must I know about the team and situation before we really get started?

  1. How experienced is the engineering team? How familiar is the team with the problem domain? How motivated is the team to address this problem?
  2. Can we co-locate the team? If not, does the team have a strong track record of working remote, and are they committed to overcoming remote challenges?
  3. Is the team comfortable with ambiguity?
  4. Does the team want to be involved in the more strategic aspects of the effort? If so, what is their background in assumption/hypothesis driven development?
  5. Is the team comfortable interacting directly with end-users and customers?
  6. Is the team empowered to solve the problem autonomously? Is there typically a lot of healthy debate and push-back? Or is the team eager for someone else to make the difficult decisions?
  7. Does the team possess a good mix of viewpoints, backgrounds, and communication styles? Or do some team members exert a disproportionate influence?
  8. What is the history of the team? Are they coming off a positive experience with high momentum, or a negative experience with no momentum?
  9. What is the history behind this effort? How has that history shaped current perceptions? Is this viewed as an “about time” project, or a “why the hell?” project? Have other teams failed? Why? If building on top of an old feature, why was the feature left in the current state? How will it impact the bottom line? Where is the product in the product lifecycle?
  10. Who are the major stakeholders? How do the stakeholders view the problem? Have they already become emotionally attached to potential solutions? Am I already biased? What is the general consensus on the risks involved? Are there any agendas at play? If so, what is our plan to navigate individual agendas?

### Goal And Vision

What is the big picture? Where are we going?

  1. Are the business goals clear and actionable? Are goals framed as target outcomes?
  2. How is our work tied to the goals of the business, and how will we measure our impact?
  3. How is our work tied to the goals of our users/customers, and how will we measure that impact?
  4. Have we communicated those goals with a compelling vision? Does the vision inspire and focus our work? Can it be explained in a tweet? What is our “true north” ? Is the team engaged?
  5. As we discover new information, have we refined the goal appropriately?

### Problem

What problem are we trying to solve?

  1. Does the team have a shared understanding of the problem we are solving? Are we speaking the same language? Does the team have a shared understanding of the problem’s root cause?
  2. Do we understand who we are solving the problem for? What are their needs? In their words, how do they describe those needs? Have we sufficiently researched our customer goals and pain points, including speaking directly with a minimum of ten customers (ideally with the team)?
  3. How are customers solving the problem right now, keeping in mind that our biggest competition is often the status quo?
  4. How much time and resources do we have to solve the problem? Are we running out of either? Do we share a similar sense of urgency? Do we share a high level idea of what we’ll be doing in the next week, weeks, month, and beyond?
  5. How will we rightsize our solution to the problem at hand? At what point will the investment of more time and energy have a limited return?
  6. If we are releasing a feature for an existing product, have we identified the feature as a basic must-have “table stakes” feature, a performance feature, or a differentiator? Have we validated this understanding, or are we operating with limited information?
  7. Who are the team’s go-to subject matter experts (SMEs)? Are they available?
  8. Have we injected the necessary awareness of the market, competition, market, and legal issues into our understanding of the problem? If not, what is the next step to gather that data?
  9. Was the team involved in defining the problem? Do they feel vested and engaged? How can we help them become more vested and engaged?
  10. Would some reframing of our goals and/or KPIs allow us to more effectively understand the problem from the perspective of the business? If this is impossible, is the team OK with the ambiguity? Is this a leap of faith, or a hesitant nosedive?
  11. What would happen if we simply did nothing? Is that an option? Is there a possibility that the problem will solve itself, or the metrics will move without our intervention?
  12. Have we framed the problem in terms of desired outcomes as opposed to possible solutions/features?
  13. Have we leveraged all of our available sources of data to understand the problem, current workarounds, customer behavior, and competitive options?

### Assumptions and Hypotheses

What are our knowns and unknowns?

  1. What are our operating assumptions? Have we validated these assumptions? Does the team understand and share these assumptions? How will we test our untested assumptions?
  2. How do these assumptions stack up in terms of risk? Who bears the possible burden of that risk? Which assumptions must we accept as givens, and which assumptions are open to testing and validation?
  3. What are the constraints to our solution? For example, do we need to use an existing technology framework? Do we have to complete the feature in time for an annual convention?
  4. What parts of the solution are negotiable? For example, could we reduce the breadth of features to release more quickly?
  5. Have we discussed our individual biases? How do these biases impact our view of the problem, and our attachment to our proposed solution?
  6. What is the current, single greatest threat to the project’s success? How will we defend against that threat?
  7. Assuming that “not delivering the intended value to the customer” is our worst case scenario, what steps can we take to make sure that does not happen?
  8. What is our biggest gap in knowledge at the moment? What do we need to learn now? What can we learn later? How can we learn quickly and cheaply? Can we restate these gaps as a series of well-articulated questions?
  9. What piece of information/data impacting our work would we gladly buy if it was immediately available? Is it available? If not, how might we “purchase” that information by committing our resources?
  10. What is the current working hypothesis in terms of a solution? Is there consensus among team members regarding our working hypothesis?
  11. Was the team involved in generating the list of key assumptions, questions, and solution hypotheses? Do they feel vested and engaged? Did the whole team have an opportunity to state key assumptions impacting their area of expertise?
  12. Could some of our questions be resolved by simply having clearer goals?
  13. We likely will need to function amidst some level of ambiguity. Are we potentially overreacting to, or under-reacting to the perceived level of ambiguity?
  14. Have we agreed on a process to track and iterate on our assumptions, risks, and questions?

### Prioritization, Sequence, Delivery

How do we do the most important thing next?

  1. Does the team have a shared understanding of our current priorities, and our near-term prioritization and sequencing of work? Are we in agreement that this is the best plan of action?
  2. Is the sequence of how we intend to release our solution optimized for information gathering? Will it be possible to gather meaningful data given the scope of the incremental releases?
  3. Have we effectively mitigated the risk of confirmation bias / tunnel vision for our solution?
  4. What key decisions will we need to make soon? How will we make these decisions? Are we about to make any irreversible decisions, and if so, do we agree on the potential risks involved?
  5. Is there consensus around which decisions can be deferred?
  6. How will we decide which features are truly essential?
  7. Is the team comfortable with the rough sizing (estimation) of prioritized items?
  8. How will we decide that we’re done? If that seems a long ways off, what are some short term definitions of done? Are these goals specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, and time constrained?
  9. Are we currently on a good trajectory to deliver the best solution possible given our current constraints?
  10. Have we collectively agreed on when we’ll reconvene to reassess our progress?
  11. To what extent are edge cases and newfound dependencies influencing prioritization? Is there a way to decouple our solution from these issues?
  12. Have we acknowledged any technical debt we might introduce into the system? What is our plan for working down any debt caused by our solution?
  13. Do we have a shared understanding of the target fidelity for the next iteration?
  14. How large is our current inventory of untested and unimplemented ideas? How much rework would be required if all of our current inventory was found to be off-target?
  15. How might potential disruption to customers guide our prioritization? Will the feature require training and “unlearning” old habits? Must we validate how we intend to launch the feature?
  16. Was the team involved in prioritizing work and developing the guidelines around how work was sequenced? If their involvement was minimal, are they ok with that?
  17. Does the sequence of work and current prioritization scheme pass rational muster with the team? Could the team repeat the prioritization and sequencing exercise and arrive at the same results? Is it a system that could be used in the future?

### Users/Customers

How do we keep the solution relevant to customers?

  1. Does the team have a working user/customer persona hypothesis? Is the persona visible?
  2. What is the current customer attitude towards the problem? Is this something that users have been expecting for years? Or will the solution come as a welcome surprise?
  3. How are we engaging our customers as we formulate and build a solution? How are we building empathy for their situation and goals? When and how, exactly, will we next share some aspect of our solution with customers?
  4. When was the last time the team interacted with a “real live” customer? What did we learn? How can we learn more when this opportunity next presents itself?
  5. Are we investing our time such that we are maximizing value to our customers? How would an average customer respond if they were to participate in our last meeting or last discussion? Would they call our work valuable? Is our work being described and framed in terms of its utility and value to customers?
  6. At what point will we expose our solution to customers using their data, in their context, and with their day-to-day organic workflows?
  7. Once released to users, how will we gather feedback such that it is actionable and timely? Do we intend to act on this feedback? Will our customers expect us to act on their feedback immediately?
  8. Are our usability testing methods matched with the phase of the solution? Are they generating statistically significant data appropriate for the phase goal? Are we using a good mix of qualitative and quantitative methods?
  9. How will we measure what our customers do in addition to what they say?
  10. What challenges might we face when gathering customer feedback? How can we address these challenges?
  11. Are we leveraging all available channels to gather customer feedback?
  12. How will we make customers aware of this feature? Is this a feature with limited appeal to our customer base? How will we measure adoption as distinct from usability or feature/need fit? Is driving adoption of the feature in scope, and if so, what is the plan to drive adoption?

### Dependencies

How do we manage dependencies?

  1. Will our solution disrupt our customers in the short term? How will this be managed, and what data will we need to feel confident in our management strategy?
  2. Are we communicating effectively to stakeholders outside of our team (sales, support, other teams, users, etc.)?
  3. Are there legal /privacy implications?
  4. Will our solution touch other parts of the product? Are we at risk of negatively impacting the user experience elsewhere?
  5. How and when are we playing “three dimensional chess” as we seek to resolve dependencies? Are we discounting the simplest path forward?

### How We Work

How does the team stay efficient and healthy?

  1. Do we have clear agendas for the next week’s worth of meetings? Do any meetings need to be repurposed to meet current challenges? Can any meetings be canceled?
  2. Are meetings managed for maximum utility? Who documents the decisions and action items resulting from meetings? Are they conducted in conducive settings, with the right tools and participants?
  3. Is the product owner available at all times?
  4. Do we have a clear idea of individual responsibilities? When there are overlaps, have we discussed potential conflicts?
  5. Does our team have the requisite information to make most decisions regarding the solution autonomously? Or, are we losing cycles due to ambiguous goals?
  6. Are we limiting the amount of extraneous and “noisy” data? Does the team feel protected from any competing agendas and politics?
  7. Are we calling things by the same name? Have we developed a common vocabulary to discuss our solution, the problem, and our assumptions?
  8. Do we have momentum? Is that sense of momentum and progress shared by all members of the team? Can the team focus on doing instead of strategizing? Is everyone inspired? Is anyone unclear about what their week looks like? Is momentum building or waning? How can we recover from a recent drop in momentum?
  9. Is anyone on the team blocked? What can be done to remove those blockers? Is our process suffering from any bottlenecks? What can be done to remove those bottlenecks?
  10. Is the team suitably buffered from distractions and disruption?
  11. Does the team feel focused and productive? Are we having fun?
  12. Is the work suitably decomposed so as to limit work in progress? Does the team share a solid definition of done?
  13. Has the team formalized its hand-offs, stages, and agreed upon process?
  14. Have factions formed within the team and, if so, are these factions healthy? Do different points of view drive value to the customer, or should we work to reduce personal bias? Can we harness these differences for good? Can any back-channels be made public?
  15. Is the team collaborating and communicating in an effective manner? Are tools being used consistently?
  16. Can I provide adequate information to other stakeholders regarding the status and focus of the effort? If a rough schedule is required, is that available? Are we maintaining a burndown chart? How does my work fit into the overall roadmap?
  17. Are all sources of information — including ticketing tools, wikis, documents — up to date? Do stakeholders have necessary access? Can extraneous information be removed for clarity?
  18. Are our emails clear, actionable, and scannable?

### Off The Rails?

What happens when things go off the rails?

  1. What does my gut say?
  2. Am I the blocker? If so, how can I change that?
  3. Is there animosity on the team? How can we dispel that immediately?
  4. Am I doing my absolute best to build a shared understanding for all aspects of the project? Am I doing so without dragging the team “through the mud” ?
  5. Beyond presenting data and sound reasoning, am I providing inspiration?
  6. Are we actually shipping?
  7. Can I see the forest through the trees? Can the team?
  8. Are my actions creating an environment of trust and ownership? If I am second guessing the team, can I find a productive way to express my concerns?
  9. What does the team need right now? Did the team crack at least one joke today? Lighten up! Time for beers.
  10. Am I taking care of myself? Eating well? Sleeping well. It all counts?

### Conclusion

Did anyone make it this far? Really? Please comment.

### Good Process, Bad Process

To most people the word “process” might as well be a four-letter word.

At some point in our career, most of us have encountered a misguided attempt
at “big bang” [business process re-
engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_reengineering). Or
a mind-numbing, soul-sapping[TPS-style approval
process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy3rjQGc6lA) (approved in
triplicate!) Or the introduction of the latest hot development approach.

But I see process in a different light. When I think about process I think
about things like the creative process, the learning process, transparent and
collaborative problem solving, information processing, and evolution and
mutation. My thoughts drift to [design
thinking](http://designthinking.ideo.com/), [surfboard
shapers,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wKfwcqD3Og) and [bespoke
tailors](http://www.anderson-sheppard.co.uk/). I just don’t share the visceral
reaction.

In this post I would like to address two common assumptions:

  1. That process is by definition rigid and inflexible
  2. That process is by definition “top down” and overly dogmatic

I’ll start by giving a couple examples of process at work.

Checklists sound awfully controlling. But, by using a checklist surgical teams
can [”significantly lower the number of deaths and
complications”](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/health/20surgery.html?_r=2&ref=health)
regardless of the type of surgery.

> But even a small change, like having surgical team members take a moment to
say who they are and what they do before scalpel touches skin, can have
important consequences later on should one of them develop a concern during
the operation. Earlier studies have shown that communication problems are
fairly common in operating rooms, with junior members of the team sometimes
hesitant to speak up.

While a staff psychologist with the Israeli military, [Daniel Kahneman (Think,
Fast and Slow)](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-
Kahneman/dp/0374533555) describes how his team disrupted the common practice
of assessing new recruits. Instead of relying on intuition and a comprehensive
assessment,[Kahneman introduced a new process consisting of a simple 5 point
quantitative survey](http://www.businessinsider.com/daniel-kahneman-on-hiring-
decisions-2013-1#ixzz3l6otUHal).

> What he came up with was so controversial it almost caused a mutiny.
Kahneman asked interviewers to put aside personal judgments and limit
interviews to a series of factual questions meant to generate a score on six
separate personality traits. A few months later, it became clear that
Kahneman’s systematic approach was a vast improvement over gut decisions. It
was so effective that the army would use his exact method for decades to come.

At Henry Poole [“each new client is a fresh and unique canvas to
us”.](https://henrypoole.com/history-of-henry-poole-tailor-of-savile-row/the-
story/) Their “cutters” use a time honored bespoke process to craft custom
tailored suits.

> With each piece of clothing being made personally by our tailors on the
premises on Savile Row, London, the theme remains consistent: individuality
expressed through craftsmanship and style.

Improv groups use a basic process [to guide the scene while keeping things
“unusual” and interesting](http://www.pantheater.com/articles-rules-of-improv-
part-i-improv-comedy.html).

> Characters need to go on journeys, be altered by revelations, experience the
ramifications of their choices and be moved by emotional moments. We go to the
theater to see the unusual days characters have, not the everyday moments of
stasis and stagnation.

The scientific method (as described by [this
teacher](http://teacher.nsrl.rochester.edu/phy_labs/appendixe/appendixe.html))
“is the process by which scientists, collectively and over time, endeavor to
construct an accurate (that is, reliable, consistent and non-arbitrary)
representation of the world”.

Alistair Cockburn describes the “heart of agile” in four simple words:
collaborate, deliver, reflect, and improve. Which is remarkably similar to the
[learning process](https://teaching.unsw.edu.au/understanding-learning-
processes), and the [Deming Circle
(PDCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*IU7FzFvFIufSAPPL.png)

Four processes form the [“basic
mechanisms”](http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_16) of
evolutionary change: mutation, migration, genetic drift, and natural
selection.

The creative process invites experimentation, and iteration. In describing the
making of Bitches Brew (Miles Davis), [Author Paul Tingen quotes drummer Jack
DeJohnette](http://jazztimes.com/articles/20243-miles-davis-and-the-making-of-
bitches-brew-sorcerer-s-brew):

> This was the beautiful thing about it. He’d do a take, and stop, and then
get an idea from what had just gone before, and elaborate on it, or say to the
keyboards ‘play this sound.’ One thing fed the other. It was a process, a kind
of spiral, a circular situation. The recording of Bitches Brew was a stream of
creative musical energy. One thing was flowing into the next, and we were
stopping and starting all the time, maybe to write a sketch out, and then go
back to recording. The creative process was being documented on tape, with
Miles directing the ensemble like a conductor an orchestra.

The point I’m making with these examples is that process itself is not the
problem. Trying to demonize the concept of a series of steps towards an
outcome is like calling breathing an anti-pattern. Calling it by some other
name: craft, practice, “way of working”, method, and ritual is more palatable
for the process phobe, but we often are discussing the exact same concept.

Thinking on the examples above, a good process …

  1. Represents the current tactic with full knowledge that the tactic may change
  2. Attempts to eliminate individual biases and groupthink
  3. Allows us to reflect on what is and isn’t working using both qualitative and quantitative data
  4. Allows for iteration
  5. Is explicit and transparent … everyone knows what we’re trying to accomplish, minimize, and maximize
  6. Encourages variability and conformance when it is most valuable
  7. Engages the participants and players in an inclusive fashion by harnessing them as sensors and actors
  8. Is repeatable relative to the diversity of inputs and desired outputs
  9. Does not usurp and try to control the collective intelligence of your team

I’d like to end by discussing discipline and process. [Alistair Cockburn has a
great YouTube video on disciplined
Agile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4QEASusC-c) which inspired this line
of thinking.

We often equate discipline and process with rigidity. It just sounds
inflexible. Cockburn claims that “lazy Agile” is surprisingly effective, but
that we can do better by exploring different methods, and processes. Yes this
discipline has more “process” (a couple more box and arrow diagrams), but it
is no less (and perhaps even more) “Agile”.

A disciplined approach can be extremely flexible (you don’t see MMA fighters
throwing up their hands due to the variability of their opponents). And the
disciplined team — just like the disciplined improv group — knows when to
break the rules and explore a new process.

The truly agile organization resists the temptation to oversimplify. Like
surgeons with their checklist it evolves processes to de-bias decisions and
applies discipline (the good kind) and process where it will have the most
leverage. This approach empowers all layers of the organization to experiment
with and evolve the current tactic while making the tactic transparent and
explicit. When modifying open source code we check out the “code” (the
process), iterate, and check back in improvements for testing. It is
egalitarian but disciplined.

In closing, I’d encourage readers to define and practice process (under the
guise of any word, really) in a way that generates results and introspection
for your team and organization.

### Product Ownership: 10 Core Principles

When you boil it down, what does it take to be a great product owner? It’s
easy (and tempting) to overcomplicate things. Often we focus on the “higher
level” aspects and theory of the function, and forget the basics. In my mind,
it all centers around your relationship with your team.

**10 Core Product Ownership Principles**

  1. **Build trust.** Without the trust of your team you have nothing.
  2. **Respect** your team, your customers, and your partners
  3. **Prove your worth**. You aren’t a status-checker along for the ride. You have a function (multiple functions actually). Do the work to build trust, build respect, and empower the team.
  4. **Outcomes over features. **Focus on delivering great outcomes to your customers. Nothing is more discouraging for a team than delivering great software that no one needs, or not knowing whether your work had impact.
  5. **Communicate efficiently**. Boil everything down to an actionable message. You are the noise and distraction filter. Synthesize ruthlessly so others don’t have to.
  6. **Build an action framework**. Provide the data, direction, and exposure necessary for autonomous decision making. Let the team take credit for their solution.
  7. **Decide and facilitate appropriately. **Sometimes the team needs a decider. Sometimes the team needs help making a decision. And sometimes you need to just get out of the way. Act accordingly.
  8. **Run great meetings.**
  9. **Focus on team needs**. How can you help your team today? What do they actually need? Focus there.
  10. **Have fun. **If you view product ownership as a battle between you and the team, then no one will have fun. Keep it light and positive.

That’s it. Not too complicated. But no one said it would be easy!

### Juggling Growth and Usability: A UX Debt Primer

The concept of technical debt is generally understood. But what happens when
we extend the concept to product design and user experience? Can an interface
accumulate debt? And what can we do about it?

### Technical Debt Primer

The now well known metaphor technical debt was coined by [Ward
Cunningham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham)to describe both the
intentional and unintentional accumulation of loose ends in software design.
Taking the metaphor too literally gets you in trouble (and can derail any
meeting, especially with engineers), but the general idea is that at some
point all organizations have to “pay off” the debt through a deliberate
allocation of resources, “write off” the debt by starting over, and/or suffer
the consequences.

Lucky companies play the balancing act to perfection, foregoing key decisions
until the last possible moment, while benefitting from current knowledge and
data. Unlucky companies eventually take a big hit, falling behind competitors
as they struggle to dig out. And negligent organizations inject debt
haphazardly, without any quantitative sense of the debt being accumulated or
the interest rate.

### Agile, XP, and Technical Debt

One thing that agile does very well is to iteratively address customer-focused
features. When paired with [extreme programming (XP)
practices](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html), such as test-driven
development and pair programming, agile does a decent job of hedging against
certain forms of technical debt, and striking that fine balance between speed,
quality, and cost. Evolved teams dedicate some percentage of resources to the
[gradual reduction of debt,](http://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2014/03/04/reversing-
your-organizations-technical-debt/?mod=wsjcio_hp_deloitte) and use sound
design principles (e.g. system decoupling, design patterns, etc.) to ease the
pain. So for technical debt, we have some models for success, albeit with a
lot of debate in the engineering community.

### UX Debt

The discussion becomes a bit more complicated when we discuss the concept of
UX debt. What happens when we accumulate baggage in our product design and
interface?

[Lean UX](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/07/lean-ux-getting-out-of-
the-deliverables-business/) practices have done a great deal towards
integrating design into the agile process, with a strong focus on cross-team
facilitation, less up-front design, and tighter collaboration between
engineers, designers, and other usability/design oriented disciplines (like
researchers, information architects, etc.)

But many designers will admit to a nagging worry. The thought that keeps them
up at night is whether the whole product experience is the best it can be, and
when will they need to pay off the debt incurred during rapid, feature-focused
design. If big upfront design is dead, then how do we create cohesive user
experiences in a flurry of discrete features?

### The Symptoms

UX debt can be recognized by some of the following symptoms:

  * The interface fails to gracefully absorb new features (tab overload, action overload). Remember Amazon prior to the [2011 redesign](http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/02/amazon-coms-big-redesign-is-arriving-soon/)?
  * Design patterns are highly specialized, linear, and task based (which isn’t surprising given the features were built based on user stories)
  * Customer blindness to new features. Interface does not encourage natural exploration of new features
  * Inconsistency with regards to interaction patterns, information architecture, and UI components. For new users [this causes significant cognitive load](http://www.clemson.edu/catlab/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/mendel-pak-2009.pdf)
  * Difficulty adapting interface for new screens, new applications, new integrations
  * Heavy coupling between the presentation layer and backend. “Re-skinning” the whole product, or similar components across product, is difficult or impossible
  * Addressing usability issues in “green field” type projects, while ignoring UX issues in core flows in the product. This typically suggests some technical limiters / blockers when it comes to refactoring the UX.

A key takeaway here is that accumulating design debt is not inherently bad.
There might be perfectly good reasons why your company exhibits these
symptoms, and chooses to focus elsewhere. Design is certainly not the only
discipline to be sacrificed in the quest for speed to market and growth (think
gathering data, tools to speed customer service, etc.). The trouble is that UX
debt is often poorly understood and misvalued. It just starts to “feel” wrong,
without any quantitative metrics to prove otherwise.

### Lack of Forcing Function

As with technical debt, the difficulty here is that there is rarely some “do
or die” moment that acts as a forcing function. Big tidal shifts like the rise
of mobile, or a violent loss of market share do happen, but most of the time
things don’t move that fast.

Like a sailboat picking up barnacles and kelp, the slowdown can be barely
perceptible, until impacts start to accrue exponentially (as is common with
highly dynamic systems like interfaces). Going from 8 mph to 7 mph takes a
while, but suddenly you’ve dropped from 7 mph to 4 mph, and you need to turn
into the wind, pull down the sails, and send someone overboard to address the
issue. And it is never easy: existing customers seldom welcome redesigns with
open arms, even if you are making the product more generally usable.

### Invisible

Another problem is that UX debt is often invisible (which is rather
counterintuitive considering it is the central touchpoint for the customer).
Engineers seldom use all the product features on a regular basis. And UX debt
just doesn’t hit home like failing systems and code modules. Customer support
staff, while often being expert users, adopt workarounds. Especially in B2B
products, there exists a general sense that users can be “trained” to adopt
suboptimal flows. And finally, and probably most importantly, humans have
trouble noticing slight changes. The product design literally changes under
our noses, until something big and serious happens. This often comes in the
form of a competitor who offers superior design and ease of use, while we’re
left struggling to keep up.

### Usability Testing

Usability testing in the context of agile development often focuses solely on
the feature in question. Tasks are developed, and the participant is asked to
proceed through a task while talking out loud. Like an architect building
extremely comfortable rooms with awkwardly placed doors and lights, it is
possible for flows to test well while remaining unusable and inconsistent
within the context of the whole product. The agile focus on tested usable
features delivered quickly is immensely valuable, but doesn’t inherently
address consistency and general usability.

### A Continuous Juggling Act (And Some Tips)

The juggling act never ends. The best strategy is one of quantification,
informed risk mitigation, and building awareness of the issue. The integration
of UX on agile teams is relatively new, and there simply might not be a full
appreciation for the risks involved. Cataloging missing features is old hat,
but understanding why the holistic design strategy matters is a relatively new
challenge. To get the discussion going, I’d like to present a few possible
strategies to make UX debt real, address it early, and build awareness across
the team:

  1. **Always test your product with people who fit your customer profile**, but who are not current customers. Do your best to avoid the[anchoring bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring) whereby the standard for excellence is the current product. Think of this as TDD (test driven development) for product design. Ask yourself how you can develop a repeatable process to assess whole-product usability by user role.
  2. **Establish usability benchmarks against commonly used products both in your domain and outside your domain**. And test your product against those benchmarks. Time to completion for tasks is informative only when relative to the time it would take the same user to complete a familiar task. In many domains with late adopters, it can be easy to trounce the competition from a usability perspective. But remember that your customers will evolve and establish new benchmarks. Mobile is a major catalyst in terms of turning late adopters into power users with high UX expectations.
  3. **Catalog components** in your software and categorize by pattern, application, visitor traffic, and whether they are on the critical path to key conversions. Many teams are unaware of just how many variations they have developed
  4. **Find a way to quantify your UX debt**. Options could include combining the results of benchmark tests (both customers and non-customers), customer feedback, and inline surveys. The emphasis here is getting buy in for your methodologies across the team, and making the accumulation (and pay off) of debt visible
  5. **Leverage pattern libraries and frameworks** for DRY UI development.
  6. **Assume that the interface will change**. Trends will develop. Technologies will develop. So how will you consistently offer the best user experience possible? Approach this challenge in partnership with your engineers, and adopt practices in systems design that will allow an [architecture to emerge](http://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2013/august/agile-architecture-emerges-or-does-it)
  7. **Discuss the risk with your team.** UX is a new addition to agile teams, and ways of working are still be ironed out. An exercise might involve a pre-mortem, whereby team members discuss how ignoring UX debt might derail the team at some future point.
  8. **Establish checkpoints and regular design reviews** to recognize when redesign or refactoring of the interface is required. Involve the whole team
  9. Dedicate some part of every sprint to working down UX related debt

# User Stories and Data

I frequently hear questions like …

* * *

### User Stories and Data

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*YI6YoTq9GexVQpoNxav-dA.png)

I frequently hear questions like …

**_“How do you know what to measure?”_**  
**_“How do you write data stories?”_**  
**_“Where do we even start?”_**

One approach is to write data-specific user stories. These stories often look
something like this:

**_Data stuff. See John_**

That’s not great. Though it is a placeholder for a conversation which is a
good user story pattern. I’ll give it that. One step up is to try something
like this:

**_As a product development team, we can measure the rate of successful adoption for the new widget maker so that we can optimize the experience for customers_**

This is decent. But something is missing. Where is the direct value to the
customer? And if you’re like most teams this type of story will be an
afterthought. Which makes perfect sense. User value ([and user
personas](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/personas-epics-user-stories/))
comes first.

I prefer to take another approach. Incorporate data into each and every story.

Think for a moment about the “T” in the [popular INVEST
acronym](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/invest.html) (a way to remember
and assess what makes a good User Story). User stories are supposed to be
Testable. We go to great ends to write unit, functional, and integration
tests. But how about testing our basic hypotheses? Or that the story is
meeting user expectations and driving the expected value?

User acceptance testing to the rescue! Well, sort of. Wouldn’t it be great if
everything worked as smoothly as this
[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4904096/whats-the-
difference-between-unit-functional-acceptance-and-integration-test) snippet:

> If the tests pass, it means the software should meet the customer’s
requirements and the stories can be considered complete. An acceptance test
suite is basically an executable specification written in a domain specific
language that describes the tests in the language used by the users of the
system.

Great. Fire up that domain specific language. When your executable
specification passes you’ve got a winning feature! Mark it complete! And keep
that velocity rolling. Cue my favorite user story from real 1st hand
experience:

**_As a product manager, I can see the [Feature Name] feature finished in two weeks, so that I can approve it_**

Joke? Almost. Keep in mind that the Scrum basically relies on a customer, or
customer proxy, to sit there and “approve” the feature. You’re done at the end
of the sprint when someone nods and says “yes”. And then the feature
disappears off into the ether. **Out of Sprint, out of mind! **Or at least
into the hands of business analysts.

But acceptance tests give a valuable hint. Let’s take a look at a [popular
acceptance test format](http://codesqueeze.com/the-easy-way-to-writing-good-
user-stories/):

> Given [context] And [some more context]… When [event] Then [outcome] And
[another outcome]…

Sure this format can be used for the low level aspects of a story. But take a
broader view. We’re making assumptions about:

  * **Context:** The problem context or situation
  * **Events:** Events taken to rectify the problem
  * **Outcomes: **What outcomes result from attempts to solve the problem

Consider this example from a great, new, product idea I just had:

> Example: **GIVEN** that people are perpetually in need of social
gratification,**AND THAT** they enjoy seeing news from their friends, **WHEN**
they encounter a “feed” of friend related news-snippets, **THEN** they will
spend hours online, and may even click on ads.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*t8aZUJuE-oRCvArH.gif)

Bingo! You have some clues for what to measure. You have context, events, and
outcomes. Now validate!

[Alexander Cowan puts it bes](http://www.alexandercowan.com/best-agile-user-
story/)t:

> It’s silly to hold your nose, take the plunge and hope you’re right. It’s
practical and effective to max out what you can know without spending a lot of
time and money, start with the simplest possible implementation of a new
feature, and then have an explicit plan to get a definitive result about its
relevance. This is how a lot of actual innovation happens- effective
experimentation (aka effective trial and error).

When I suggest this approach, the first question I typically hear is something
like:

> This is all good in theory, but Scrum says I need to mark the job complete
at the end of two weeks. And that we’ll ship it. There is no place for this
experiment! And we’ll never finish those stories if we actually add the
tracking.

To that I would ask whether it is better to do the 20% that matters, or the
80% that doesn’t. Which brings up my final point. Taking a more data-centric
approach is actually not about the tools, or even how you write stories. It is
about something more fundamental.

Do you have dedicated, cross-functional, problem focused, and outcome driven
teams? And do they actually control the destiny and shape of their work? Are
they allowed to fail sometimes? And are they incentivized for output and
utilization (being busy) or generating results?

Answer those questions and address any issues there (easier said than done),
and then find a way to work in the data stories. My preference is to place
them immediately in the user-centric stories or epics. Keep it lightweight,
and similar to acceptance tests. Add some baselines and targets. And then use
Kanban or another tool to pass the stories out from the sprint, and into a
measure/learn flow. You may be “done”, but the story isn’t “Done” until it has
achieved the desired intent.

### 10 Questions For Your (Product Role) Interviewer

It’s that nervous time of the product manager interview. You’re tired, need to
re-caffeinate, are worried you don’t have enough “domain experience”, and have
just had to calculate the number of[ airplane passengers currently airborne in
the United States](https://www.quora.com/How-many-people-are-in-the-air-
flying-at-any-given-time).

The dreaded question is coming … “do you have any questions for me?” Oh crap!

Let me try to flip the script for you. You are interviewing this company for
the opportunity to have you work there, and not the other way around. Product
Management is extremely org-specific. It’s the perfect example of
product/market fit (with you being the product). What works in one company
will leave you burnt out, ineffective, and maligned in the next. It is vital
that you find a place where you can thrive. So use this opportunity wisely.

During the hiring process there may be a lot of talk about empowerment,
ownership, and customer-centric thinking (sidenote, if you hear the one about
the mini-CEO just leave immediately). Are they putting lipstick on a pig and
rolling out a gravity challenged magic carpet? Or describing your next dream
job? Below I’ve listed 10 questions to ask when the interview tables are
turned. Be curious and respectful, and let’em rip.

  1. Knowing what you know at the moment, what weakness might I need to work on if I were to get this job? How would we go about structuring opportunities to improve on that weakness?
  2. If you were to hire a product manager internally from another department/group, what is your best bet at the department they would currently work for? Why?
  3. How would you rank the following in terms of your overall priorities: speed, rigor, quality, harmony, outcomes, and empathy ?
  4. Are there recurring sources of tension between functional groups in the organization? Are they healthy? If so, how do you make sure they stay healthy?
  5. How does your approach to product differ from that of your competitors? Who do you admire in your space (or another domain)? How are you differentiated?
  6. Has the product team established any core values? What are they? Could you tell me a story or two that would help me understand those values? How has the role of product management evolved here over the years?
  7. Let’s say I was to go out and ask one of your engineers about their relationship with the product team … what would they say? What would be their foremost gripe? How would they describe the value you deliver to them personally?
  8. If the 80/20 rule holds true (and it tends to), what is the 20% of my work that will generate 80% of the value? Where will I have the most leverage in my day-to-day work? How do you help the team focus on this area?
  9. In Geoffrey A. Moore’s [Crossing The Chasm](http://readwrite.com/2007/08/06/rethinking_crossing_the_chasm) he mentions a Technology Adoption Lifecycle comprised of three primary markets: **Early** (Innovators and Early Adoptions), **Mainstream** (Early Majority and Late Majority), and **Late** (Laggards). Where is the product and market currently? Where will we be in a year? How will the team and dynamics change as we make this transition?
  10. What is the most frequently misunderstood aspect of the product role internally? And how do you work to bridge that misunderstanding?

Choose wisely, or better yet just let the freak flag fly. There is no hiding
in product management. If you are passionate about what you do then don’t plan
on just flying below the radar. Don’t plan on things changing (they rarely
do). PMs are always above the radar and exist at the confluence of major
forces and pressures in the organization. So choose wisely!

Go forth and find the right match!

**Shameless Pitch:** When you’re there, consider giving [Pendo](http://www.pendo.io/) (my employer, and an all around swell place to work) a try to guide the team towards better collaborative decisions and improved user experiences. We’d get to work together and you could give blistering and honest feedback to make our product great.


# Hidden Costs of the Sales-Driven Roadmap

### Hidden Costs of the Sales-Driven Roadmap

_Exploring the cost side of the Sales Driven Roadmap_

> This deal is at risk until we can ____________

> Are you ranking these requests by the revenue opportunity?

> They won’t renew unless we _________

> Can we schedule a meeting to review the following RFP points?

As a product manager in the B2B space you’ll inevitably run into a situation
where sales is pressuring you to prioritize work to close a deal or retain a
customer. It’s a dance Sales, Product, and Customer Success repeats over and
over (picture a clumsy threeway waltz or polka). Cue the conference call
feedback, twenty page RFPs, and rushed impromptu cross-team standups.

It’s a challenge. You are customer focused. You have empathy. But somehow the
cost vs. reward feels off and you can’t prove it. Don’t give up so soon.
Consider the following …

#### Growth Driver

Before jumping into thinking about costs let’s get one thing out of the way.
At the end of the day you might not be too concerned about costs simply
because controlling costs isn’t the focus. The underlying assumption for most
growing businesses is that costs can eventually be controlled. Revenue and
growth is king (see [The Single Biggest Determinant Of Startup Valuations At
IPO](http://tomtunguz.com/2013-ipo-characteristics/)). You’ll read the impacts
below and say “that’s all good, but we need to hit a growth goal”. I respect
that. But I’d challenge you to consider instead the potential drags on
innovation and agility. These are blockers to growth and should be considered.
Keep reading …

#### Bias Petri Dish

It’s easy to rationalize the broad appeal of a feature request. We’d need to
do this eventually, right? Other customers and prospects will need this if
Acme needs this, right? There are a bunch of cognitive biases at play here
including the [availability
heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic), [base rate
fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy), [clustering
illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_illusion), [sunk cost
bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs), [confirmation
bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias), and [conjunction
fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy). These manifest as
follows:

  * _The prospect is representative of other prospects and customers_
  * _The prospect’s needs are not specif. They are general_
  * _The prospect request is equally valued by other customers and prospects_
  * _Meeting the prospect request will actually result in a satisfied customer_
  * _We’ve invested a lot of time and money in cultivating this prospect so …_
  * _This run of requests represents a trend_

We’ve all been victims to these biases in our personal and work lives. You
can’t escape. As a species these instincts have served us well for the most
part. However, the prospect request is straight out of an MIT behavioral
economics study. It hits so many pressure points that most of us are basically
screwed. It’s as if you combined the lottery, your love life, and probability
in a petri dish. What’s the point here? You’re not seeing things clearly and
your intuition is suspect.

#### Net Loss

Off the bat you’re at a net-loss if you invest $50,000 in engineering and
product resources to deliver a feature which will increase your revenue by
$100,000. Why? Isn’t that a profit? No. Not even close. The code will need to
be maintained and will add to the complexity of the overall codebase hindering
future velocity and innovation. Features need documentation, sales training,
marketing, and support. And we’re not even talking about the other costs
associated with that $100k of revenue (acquisition, on ramping, etc.) No one
“accounts” for these costs. They rarely exist on a balance sheet. But they’re
real and will bite you.

#### User Experience Impact

Imagine an aging hotel. Hallways disappear into nowhere. The light switches
are never in the right place. It takes ten minutes to get to the pool. The
Internet is spotty. Countless new additions create a sprawl that is difficult
to navigate.

Welcome to the world of most enterprise software. You can get by for a while …
heck, the “user” didn’t even cut the check … but you can never truly escape.
This costs is extremely difficult to quantify but we’ve all, at some point,
been on the receiving end of enterprise software that truly sucks usability-
wise. And when a disruptor pops up that shifts the script we’re all the more
willing to embrace the alternative.

#### Customer Need

The prospect has a list of requirements. Lists of requirements feel
comfortable. They’re relatively easy to write — heck, just add a couple points
for good measure. Someone owns this decision and by golly they’re going to own
it. As someone involved in buying tools I can say without doubt that the
requirements process is simply broken. It’s aspirational. Big and heavy RFPs
are a recipe for failed implementations and software detritus. They may close
deals, but they are not a leading indicator of long term adoption. In the heat
of the moment it’s tempting to treat the RFP as gospel and the byproduct of
careful research. It rarely is. The customer may rave about your
responsiveness at first, but they might not be any happier in a year.

From an Agile perspective this is a big “requirements upfront” anti-pattern:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*ovSub-mFzsrJzHrZTo7J-A.png)

Looks simple huh? ([Source](http://sunnibrown.com/2009/05/rfp-evaluation-
process-map))

As someone with UX Research experience I can say beyond a doubt that lists of
features rarely address true needs. They jump to the What before the Why.

#### **Value Proposition**

If one feature is the deciding factor between the buy or pass what does that
tell you about your business and product? Consider tools that solve a unique
pain incredibly well. We get frustrated as users. We have to invent
workarounds to make up for missing features. But we use it anyway because it
does something incredibly well. If you’re battling over RFP bullet points
consider the game you want to play. Are you battling over commodity features?

#### Opportunity Costs

This one is simple. By working on one thing you are by definition not working
on something else. What are you sacrificing to attend to the prospect request?
What could you build or explore given those resources? What is the value of
doing this now vs. two months from now?

#### Distractions &amp; Multitasking

External requests typically involve a lot of multitasking. There are endless
cycles back and forth between sales, product management, and engineering. It’s
hard to get the right people on the phone. You’re at the whim of conference
calls. Just when you think you’ve nailed down the request someone else pops up
and peppers your understanding like a gattling gun. Conservatively the team is
at 50% effectiveness and it seeps into their other responsibilities.

Product development teams also feel the pinch. Prospect requests are typically
run in parallel with existing roadmap driven work. It takes 3x the amount of
time to finish two parallel tracks. SImply put, your team runs slower.

#### Conclusion

Hopefully that gives you some food for thought. I currently work for
[Pendo.io](http://www.pendo.io/), an analytics tool with in-app guide and
messaging functionality. One of the unique selling propositions of Pendo is
that we record user activity retroactive to install. In the rush to crank out
customer requests it can be prohibitive to add metrics and measure uptake. Our
customers use this feature to reality check their intuition. Sure, the deal
closed, but did anyone end up using it? Did it impact customer satisfaction
(measurable with our in-app surveys and funnels)? The cost to answer these
questions is low which in turn improves your team’s intuition in the face of
bias. Until the costs are real, the debate will always swing towards Sales and
the immediate prospect request.

Hope this has been helpful. Follow me on Twitter at

going.


# The Way Of The Product Whatchamacallit

Behold the Product Whatchamacallit! The who? Who knows? The Internet sure
doesn’t.

* * *

### The Way Of The Product Whatchamacallit

Behold the **Product Whatchamacallit!** The who? Who knows? The Internet sure
doesn’t.

What does it do? Does it have a tail? Does it [own or
manage](http://blog.aha.io/index.php/the-product-manager-vs-product-owner/)?
Mini-CEO or minion? Who knows!? The Internet sure doesn’t. Maybe this dolphin
does. Nope.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*l7OCGXPxzzJcWXYGJt4aiA.png)

Ever feel like a smart dolphin utterly confused by Product Management?

But I’ll tell you about a recipe. It’s simply, simply simple!

#### **Ingredient #1**

Find a bunch of motivated hackers, builders, crafters,
[makers](http://www.wired.com/2013/04/makermovement/), designers of all
stripes (coders are designers, also), inventors, and visionaries. Trust them,
they’ve got a lot in common. Don’t separate them into departments. Departments
are for Sears and Macy’s.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*Cp_BQY4pvuxL87NfT4LbEg.png)

Together We Make Stuff. And Trust The Other People Know Their Shit

#### **Ingredient #2**

Start talking to humans together, observe their problems, and ponder how to
solve those problems. Build a bit. Test your assumptions, tweak, and repeat.
Sell it. And talk to those salesamajigs. They’ve got feelings too.

#### **Mind **Your Business

At this point hopefully you are all still “the business”. The product is
everyone’s business, not some distant group of people who sit in a frosty
windowed conference room dreaming up the work you’ll do for the next year (and
claim you’re still empowered to solve the problem). Fight for this for as long
as humanly possible. Decentralize. Look skeptically across the room when
someone says that you (codeword engineering and UX) just need to “execute on
the roadmap” and then doles out projects.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*gJzNUvyYbJdl23kxh5590g.png)

The Sorcerer And The Magic ProjectMap

#### **The Product Whatchamacallit**

So you are still **The Business**. It’s **Your Business To Mind**. Your
[Product To Mind](http://www.mindtheproduct.com/). Phew. Even then, there will
probably be some need for a Product Whatchamacallit, but the role will be much
more helpful and tangible. She’ll be a person the team would hire if they
controlled the budget (not such a crazy idea, actually). Because that person
will DO helpful stuff and earn their keep, not just lubricate the three creaky
gears of your org.

If you happen to be that lucky person -- and trust me this isn’t the standard
“recipe for burnout, can’t wait till I’m in biz dev or strategy” role -- then
read on. Embrace the Whatchamacallit Way.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*YdTYpziOt-ne-H28INCZzQ.png)

Maybe? Could it be?

### The **Way Of The Product Whatchamacallit**

  * Show empathy **NOT** indifference
  * Ask why and who **NOT** how and what
  * Serve teams **NOT** agendas
  * Be guided by principles **NOT** plans
  * Be a team-member **NOT** a team-driver
  * Focus on challenges and needs **NOT** titles
  * Treat teammates like creative makers **NOT** resources
  * Provide context and data **NOT** solutions and platitudes
  * Have suggestions and opinions **NOT** demands and fiats
  * Be curious and open **NOT** dismissive and stubborn
  * Harness diversity **NOT** conformity
  * Embrace simplicity **NOT** oversimplification
  * Deliver outcomes and impact **NOT** features and output
  * Build less **NOT** more
  * Be transparent **NOT** opaque or manipulative
  * Be accessible **NOT** elusive or overbearing

Together we deliver valuable outcomes and delight the humans who use and pay
for our product, and the business and team will benefit. We’ll feel good about
our work, and customers will come up to us in airports when we wear our shwag
t-shirts and thank us.

Go forth Whatchamacallit ! They’ll tell you “it’s not that simple”! Ask Why
five times and see where you get …

### This PM Hack Saved Me 1 Hour A Day (and helped me connect with more
customers)

_How I saved an hour every day, stopped wasting my team and customers’ time,
and gathered valuable insights and feedback from our customers._

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*KiQcA8JAMWnAV31b.)

**Image by **[**petradr**](https://unsplash.com/petradr)

As a product manager (with strong UX tendencies) I start to get very anxious
if I’m not talking to customers daily. I don’t discriminate between
qualitative and quantitative data. It’s all valuable. Spend too much time
looking at charts, graphs, and tables, and you’re liable to to lose sight of
the “Why” and the story.

Enter the product manager’s arch nemesis: time management. Scheduling calls is
a hassle for all parties. It’s terrible UX and I hate wasting customer time.
Building a research panel / customer panel with survey data is all well and
good, but it often fails to sift the signal from the noise. You often chat
with customers [who don’t actually use the feature or don’t fit the
profile](http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/07/recruiting-better-
research-participants.php). Or worse yet you just focus on the “vocal
minority” instead of the [silent majority](https://www.box.com/blog/building-
products-vocal-minority-or-silent-majority/).

Enter in-app targeting and online booking tools. At
[Pendo](http://www.pendo.io/) we love to [dog-food our own
product](https://beatrixapp.com/blog/6-months-of-dogfooding-our-
software.html). Our guide targeting functionality allows fine-grained
targeting based on activity, feature usage, and external data (from Salesforce
and other integrations).

Below I’ll walk you through the ingredients for a recent real-world use case.
My goal was to set up meetings with customers to discuss their “[jobs to be
done](https://medium.com/the-job-to-be-done)” for our guides functionality.
What decisions do they make daily? How can we help them do their job more
effectively?

### Ingredient 1#: An In-App Guide

In this example I used the standard Pendo lightbox
[template](https://pendo.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/2245494) with a
simple call to action. Keep the copy light and appreciative. “Schedule It!” is
a good CTA because it conveys the ability to complete the task without human
assistance. I prefer this approach to email because it reaches the customer
in-context when they are more receptive to the guide copy and request for
feedback.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*wFtBcCDbEcqnPPOj.)

### Ingredient #2: Targeting

I targeted this guide to frequent users of our guide detail page (guide
details page viewed &gt; 5 times). This is case where casting a wide net is
NOT ideal. You want to screen your interviewees, and limit the disruption to
visitors who don’t match your screening criteria.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*ac-puspG3KKhjjzj.)

### Ingredient #3:A online booking app.

I suggest [YouCanBookMe](https://youcanbook.me/). Some important features are:
setting a recurring lunch break, specifying work hours, appointment lead time
(min and max), etc. This will make your life easier. The YCBM free version
allows a single booking profile, but still manages to add appointments to my
calendar. From a customer standpoint, the experience is pretty intuitive. They
click on the button in the guide and see this:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*KyEhoG_XcqKl_NZJ.)

### Outcome

Out of 50 of our customers who saw this guide, 10 booked appointments. A 20%
response rate for research requests — qualified real world users, no less — is
pretty awesome. Consider an email campaign with 30% open rates and 30%
response rates and we’re talking a ~2x improvement with no hassle. I didn’t
need to send a survey to a panel. I didn’t litter people’s email inboxes and
play email tag. And this all occurred on the “customer’s terms” and at their
convenience. Our sessions were more productive and focused without the typical
scramble around booking. Best of all, the data was more actionable for the
team.

Give it a try! My philosophy is to talk to customers daily. You need to
reality check your assumptions daily and, to [quote Steve
Blank](http://www.inc.com/steve-blank/key-to-success-getting-out-of-
building.html), “get out of the (virtual) building”. When you cut the
scheduling insanity, this suddenly becomes MUCH easier.


# As Product Managers We’re Asking Ourselves The Wrong Set Of Questions

Stop trying to define product management. It’s a fool’s game.

* * *

### As Product Managers We’re Asking Ourselves The Wrong Set Of Questions

_Stop trying to define product management. It’s a fool’s game._

_Stop defining yourself by what you aren’t. What do you care about? How do you
want to work with the people around you?_

When reading articles about product management you frequently encounter words
like “[chameleon](https://blog.intercom.io/the-product-manager-chameleon/)”,
“[whitespace](https://medium.com/@danielfschmidt/a-map-of-white-space-for-
product-managers-17d65c397749)”, and
“[glue](http://onproductmanagement.net/2009/06/22/why-do-we-undermine-
ourselves/)”. “It’s complicated!” Product Management is described by what it
isn’t (e.g. [project management](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-de-haaff
/the-product-manager-vs-pr_b_8040402.html), [scrum
master](http://blog.aha.io/index.php/the-product-manager-vs-the-scrum-
master/)) or by how it is expressed in the context of a domain or methodology
(e.g. in [Agile](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/), in
[B2B](http://www.mindtheproduct.com/2014/06/product-management-b2b/), in
[SaaS](http://pragmaticmarketing.com/resources/saas-product-management), in
Lean Startup).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*2ordkKcC7Vqb17nx60_coA.png)

… surfing the Google in search for answers

I’ve been in teams that — after a year — still couldn’t describe the value the
PM/PO brought to the table. The answer was to keep regurgitating the same
posts and books …. as if to say “see, we DO something! I’m valuable because
Intercom or Marty Cagan said so!”

In 2015 I attended three conferences where the best presenter jokes were PM/PO
jokes, and the audience of UXers and Engineers ate it up.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*m9YMgBo9_5syWPhYqgjkyw.png)

In my view we’re asking the wrong question. We’re replacing a tough discussion
of values and principles — as a whole team, not just as product managers —
with discussions about titles, job descriptions, the org chart, and handoffs.
The best perspectives on product development [have nothing to do with defining
and boxing a title](https://medium.com/@stewart/we-dont-sell-saddles-here-
4c59524d650d#.w2rffmxtb). [Stewart Butterfield](https://medium.com/@stewart)
doesn’t mention the word “manager” once but you walk away from reading that
knowing he gives a damn.

It’s gotten to the point that I don’t recommend product management to hungry,
entrepreneurial, and creative young people. I advocate for the various hats
occasionally worn by PMs, but caution against the “title”. **I suggest User
Experience or Engineering. **There’s a community of practice and a less
weighty chip on the shoulder.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*WzG_M_41ku68_uSZEPjTLg.png)

Consider what a young associate product manager wrote me the other day:

> My boss is the VP of Product. She has needs and pushes me. Then the team.
wants to do a good job. I feel them. So do I, but I have all this other crap
to consider. I want to be customer-centric but Sales keeps pushing product.
I’m pushing back all day. I deflect shit. The team kinda resents me. They
don’t see 80% of the shit I deal with. It is this juggling act. I am a
juggling act … I don’t even know what “product” means anymore …

That pains me as a lover of building great products. My bet … she’ll leave the
industry in 6 years. Tops.

As Product Managers we insist on describing what we aren’t or what we connect
(how/what) instead of what we value (the “why”). Values are lofty, but we fail
to take a stand.

That extends to how we want to be with our fellow product development
teammates. And with that, I offer my personal values and principles as they
pertain to working with teams. **Your values / principles will vary (**these
appeared first in my post [The Way Of The Product
Whatchamacallit](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/the-way-of-the-product-
whatchamacallit-9929a78d6694#.ln3zzv6sf) )

  * Show empathy **NOT** indifference
  * Ask why and who **NOT** how and what
  * Serve teams **NOT** agendas
  * Be guided by principles **NOT** plans
  * Be a team-member **NOT** a team-driver
  * Focus on challenges and needs **NOT** titles
  * Treat teammates like creative makers **NOT** resources
  * Provide context and data **NOT** solutions and platitudes
  * Have suggestions and opinions **NOT** demands and fiats
  * Be curious and open **NOT** dismissive and stubborn
  * Harness diversity **NOT** conformity
  * Embrace simplicity **NOT** oversimplification
  * Deliver outcomes and impact **NOT** features and output
  * Build less **NOT** more
  * Be transparent **NOT** opaque or manipulative
  * Be accessible **NOT** elusive or overbearing

What are your values as they pertain to collaboration? What do you care about
personally? Beyond what you aren’t … what are you? Start there. And then worry
about the bullets in your job description and the platitudes of “customer
first”, “connective tissue”, and “balancing acts”.

### 50 Interview Questions For B2B SaaS Customer Research

_A no-nonsense list of of questions for B2B SaaS Customer Research_

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*iDQbRKoEiCmtCjRbM93D9A.png)

This is an audio cassette

I’m going to jump straight in …. I’ve got a lot of customer interviews coming
up in the next week ([I blame in-app
scheduling](http://blog.pendo.io/2016/01/22/this-product-manager-hack-saved-
me-one-hour-a-day-and-helped-me-connect-with-more-customers/)) and figured
that it was a good time to put some pen to paper. First some context:

#### **Interview Goals**

  * Know customers and their “[jobs to be done](http://www.christenseninstitute.org/key-concepts/jobs-to-be-done/)”
  * Focus on problems vs. solutions

#### **Remind customers that …**

  * They can’t hurt your feelings
  * Your job isn’t to sell them, market to them, or take their feature requests
  * There are no right, wrong, or stupid answers
  * You’re happy to address support questions after the interview

#### **Interview Tips:**

  * Use words/phrases like “show me”, “tell me that story”, “what’s a real world example of that”, “why”, “who”, “how come”, “tell me more”, “how do you do that right now”, “sketch that” etc.
  * Be comfortable with awkward silences
  * Talk less as a rule. Let the customer do the talking.
  * Be aware of nonverbal cues, and “leading”. Take a deep breath and smile. Repeat words to yourself to stay in the zone like “curious”, “observant”, “patient”, “open”, “non-judgmental”, and “respectful”. Write these down as reminders
  * Use an audio recorder so as not to distract the customer. Or have a notetaker

Notes from a recent meeting …

Commence!

### The Questions

Important: In these questions **Acme** is your product or brand. “You” is the
customer.

  1. If you weren’t working as a/n **[customer title]** what would you be doing?
  2. If you had one work-related superpower what would it be? How would it work? Every superhero has a weakness. What’s your weakness?
  3. If **Acme** was a brand of car, what would it be? Why?
  4. What is the least understood aspect of your job? Why?
  5. What is your unofficial job title?
  6. If you’re comfortable chatting about non-work things … what hats do you wear outside of work?
  7. Draw me the informal, real-world org chart of your department. How are things really connected? How does **it really get done?
  8. Describe your personal aspirations for your career. What are you looking for in terms of career development? What’s the next big hurdle? What strengths will you leverage?
  9. You have a magic ball. Money is no object. You can pick three metrics to put up on big monitors all over your team’s workspace. What are those numbers?
  10. Some things have a tangible value associated with them. Other things are intangible. What is an example of an extremely valuable — but completely intangible — aspect of your job I should understand?
  11. Describe a piece of software that gets out of the way and lets you get your work done. Now describe something that just manages to get IN your way all the time. What is the differentiator? Where does **Acme** fit in?
  12. You’ve had a tough day. You pick a song that characterizes how you feel. What song do you pick? After feeling sorry for yourself you crank up a song to move forward. What song do you pick?
  13. What “sixth-senses” do you have? How did you learn that intuition?
  14. When was the last time — outside of software vendors, but at work — that you experienced incredible customer service from a vendor? Why?
  15. A workaround is when you can’t initially get something done with the tools available, but you improvise and make things work. Describe a workaround from your work in the last month? How did you figure that out? Can you think of an **Acme** example?
  16. What is the most important lesson you’ve learned from working with YOUR customers? Any nuggets of wisdom there? How have you applied that to your day-to-day work?
  17. We all wear different hats during the day. You might be the “The Practical One” and then shift to “The Innovator” or “The Facilitator”. Imagine that you’re three different people, and that you juggle those three different personas each day. What would those hats be called? How do you act when you wear that hat? What is important to you?
  18. Most movies have that montage scene about 2/3rds of the way through when everything starts moving. It occurs immediately before the final obstacle materializes. Let’s say that movie is about your work and this organization. Tell me the story there. Walk me through the feel-good montage, and end with the big obstacle.
  19. Imagine a dream day here. Everything goes right and works smoothly. You’re in a state of flow and have a big smile on your face. Walk me through that. What is the biggest leap of faith in that description?
  20. Complete this sentence … “I hope **Acme** doesn’t screw up and ________________” . How could we become something that you hate? Where would we go wrong?
  21. How is your job performance measured formally and informally?
  22. No need to provide the details, but what are the last three big decisions you’ve had to make here? How did you go about making those decisions?
  23. What’s the last innocent — but damaging and disappointing — mistake that someone made while using **Acme**? Tell me the story there. What was the impact?
  24. Have you ever had a SFW work-related nightmare? What happened? Is it a recurring dream?
  25. Everyone has blindspots. In your opinion what is **Acme’s** blindspot when it comes to understanding you and the job you need to get done?
  26. Who do you interact with most frequently on a day-to-day basis? What are you collaborating on? What is the output?
  27. There is a major budget cut and software must go. You’re down to the bare essentials. You have to rank the importance of **Acme** between 1: Absolutely Essential and 10: Absolutely The First To Go … where are we at? Why? Who is ahead us and behind us?
  28. Describe a conversation where **Acme** came up “at the watercooler” … one positive, and one negative. What was the story?
  29. It’s Sunday and you have that sinking fear about work that’s keeping you from relaxing. What are you worrying about?
  30. What is the meat and potatoes (or veggies and seitan) of your business?
  31. You have a new employee at the company. You’re giving them the lay of the land, describing the tools they’ll use, and how they’ll use them. You have to describe **Acme**. How do you describe us to the newcomer?
  32. How would you rank the following in terms of your personality and work style. Do you prioritize: 1) Efficiency, 2) Creativity, 3) Accountability, 4) Flexibility, 5) Resilience , or 6) Influence? Why?
  33. For most jobs there is the “theoretical” way something gets done … it is nice and neat and tidy. And then the “real world” way it gets done. Can you draw me a flowchart of both? How does the real world differ?
  34. If you could automate one part of your job (and keep your job) what part would that be? What would you do with the extra time?
  35. It is twenty years ago. Replace **Acme** with a person who got this work done. What would that person’s title be? What is their job description?
  36. I’ve got ten cards here describing different things you can do with our product. Without saying anything — it’s best if we don’t talk, and remember you can’t hurt my feelings — I’d like you to draw a frowny face, smiley face, or a deadpan face on each card describing how you feel when you use that feature. And then I’d like you to sort them in terms of how important they are to your day-to-day job.
  37. Think about the other software tools you use. Fill in the blanks. Compared to ________ **Acme** is doing a great job, but compared to __________ **Acm**e has a lot to learn.
  38. **Acme** is a restaurant. What is it like eating there? What do we do well? Where do we fall flat? What is your best/worst dish?
  39. I’d like you to take a quick stab at writing the new **Acme** marketing tagline. It is short and snappy. It cuts to the chase. What is it?
  40. Times are tight and we are all busy. If you had more budget for your department, and more time to focus, what would you spend that money and time on?
  41. Imagine you’re at a meeting discussing our product. People are relaxed and speaking candidly. We’ve done a good job and have met your needs. Complete this sentence … “**Acme** has paid for itself many times over by ___________________ “.
  42. Have you ever used a piece of software that left you feeling that the developers didn’t actually try the feature? What’s that area of **Acme**? Where are we clueless? What’s a train wreck?
  43. Trust is earned. How can we earn your trust? How can we lose your trust?
  44. It’s one year from now. You’re responsible for creating a report card to decide whether to renew your contract with us. What’s on that report card? And where do we sit right now? Let’s draw it out …
  45. When was the last time you celebrated as a team because of something work related? Why?
  46. For most jobs you can let a lot of stuff slide in the short term. But there is something that simply MUST happen. If you don’t deliver in that regard you’re screwed. What is that “one thing”?
  47. This is your moment to shine. You are presenting to the whole company. You’re about to show the magic slide … the slide that rocks everyone’s world, secures your raise, and turns you into a rockstar. Can you draw it for me? What would it say? What are the three bullets?
  48. We’ve all witnessed purchasing fails over the years … that one software tool that got everyone super excited but then failed to deliver. Without naming names, could you briefly describe the “promise” (what you hoped the purchase would achieve), and then the reality when the rubber hit the road?
  49. How would you disrupt your own business if you could? You get to start over and tear it all apart. Where are things going?
  50. Describe an intractable problem from your work world … something that no amount of work, research, meetings, and discussion — formal and otherwise — can seem to fix. What is the sticking point?

I’m good with that … if the team needs/wants that. Would they pay the PM to do
that if they owned the budget? Done right — with trust, empathy, and buy-in —
this can be an incredibly valuable “hat” worn by somebody. Does it need to be
the same person all the time? Does that person need the title? That’s
something establishing your team values can uncover IMHO.

### Persona(s) Non Grata

#### _Saving the persona from itself, from selfish UX, and other tips_

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*PYLd6uR47EKj0uaWYRT3yA.png)

An engineer once described a persona exercise as “theater camp”. I thought
about that for a while and realized what she was getting at. Here I was coming
from the UX world, running the team through a song and dance exercise with
imaginary people, stickies, and line drawings. The “creative” (me) felt
comfortable — I was in my element — but to the attendees it was like a
nightmarish new-age UX drum circle.

It’s like a wrestler doing their first yoga class. Or me doing pair
programming or trying TDD. I tell the one about role playing games being the
inspiration for personas. Crickets. My jokes fall flat.

[Role Playing Game Character Sheet aka
Persona](http://markdangerchen.net/papers/coordination-cooperation-and-
camaraderie-in-world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-the-role-playing-game/)

One solution is to retrench and to consider personas as the UX rallying call.
People are going to play along whether they like to or not, **embrace my
powerful UX Empathy!** But I think that is shortsighted. I’ve experimented,
and have found some things that work.

### Yes. They’re Fake

Personas have a shaky reputation among software engineers. And that’s being
generous. I’ve been in numerous situations where teams openly (and forcefully)
expressed their distrust, dislike and aversion to personas. Mini revolts
ensued and hand drawn posters faded and magically disappeared. One engineer
described personas as the “[Joe The
Plumber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_the_Plumber)”-ification of software
development. Ouch.

In the words of engineers they seem “fake”, “contrived”, “artificial”, and
“forced”. It would be easy to write this off as a lack of empathy or
imagination (which ironically is reverse lack of empathy), but in my
experience the opposite is true. Teams genuinely want to connect with users.
The reality is that personas, at least initially, are all of those things —
fake, forced, and contrived — while at the same time being extremely valuable.

> The reality is that personas, at least initially, are all of those things —
fake, forced, and contrived — while at the same time being extremely valuable.

Pick a character from a favorite book. You’re pulled in by the story. At page
one-hundred of John Steinbeck’s _Of Mice and Men _we know Lennie and George
well enough to predict impending doom when they meet Curly (and _Curly’s
Wife_). The characters are “real” because we suspend reality long enough to
embrace the fiction. Ethnographers and UX researchers do the same: suspending
surface stereotypes long enough to embrace a more complex reality after
spending weeks/months in the field.

Both take a leap of faith — to start with something wishy washy and “fake”,
stay curious, and keep digging for something more poignant and actionable. We
create a generalization as a starting point for learning. Personas are
helpful. Use them correctly and you will develop better products. Force them
on teams — “inflict” them on teams, to quote an engineer — and you’ll erode
trust, detach the team from the user/customer, and harm the end-product.

### Whip-Cracking Personas

The worst abuse of personas is when they’re used to basically tell people what
to build and who to build it for. They embody the why, who, what, and how
without any room for exploration and disagreement. Any person in their right
mind will start ignoring these and thumb their nose. In a retrospective an
engineer once exclaimed:

> You want me to spend the next three months of my life working on something
for an imaginary person you dreamed up for the kick-off deck?

The rest of this post will assume that you’re intellectually honest and
rigorous, and that you are open to engaging with your team to build a better
product. If that’s not the case, then you’ll probably get bored.

### Yes I’m Guessing

A great start is to eat the humble pie and openly acknowledge that you’re
guessing. This seems trivial, but it might not be immediately clear to the
team that you are consciously and intentionally “making believe”. These
“[proto persona](https://uxmag.com/articles/using-proto-personas-for-
executive-alignment)” (a first pass persona not based on validated
assumptions) represents your best guess at the moment. The challenge of
product development is to iteratively validate these “who” assumptions. Who is
this fictional character? What job do they do? When we’re one-hundred pages
into this book, what will we know?

How do you structure and visualize this approach? Instead of a static (and
quickly stale) persona, we’d use a Kanban board (or “canvas”) to prioritize
assumptions, and then plan and execute experiments.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*YoQirHs3SV7frdye.)

The challenge here is that openly acknowledging how little we know is not
exactly the stuff of CTO and VP of Product dreams. It makes people uneasy.
Validated experiments don’t result in deployed 1s and 0s. Teams are frequently
measured in terms of output, not outcomes. But if you foster a culture that is
failure-safe and focused on learning you’ll be surprised by the engagement
this inspires on the team.

If you’re going to make the persona (and your assumptions) visual, commit to
keep iterating on the content as the team learns. A stale persona is worse
than no persona at all.

### “Real” People

Another approach — and one I’ve found very effective regardless of
organization culture — is to focus on “real” people instead of
generalizations. This is the persona gateway drug for the uninitiated. Knowing
that this human actually exists in flesh and blood does wonders.

At first I was skeptical and braced for the valid “low N” argument (focusing
on one person is the queen of small samples). In a fit of “ok, I’ll try
personas one last time” I took pictures, video, and audio. I had the team
design their own persona template based on a collection of real humans.
Together we referred to the users by their actual names.

These “personas” — while not strict personas — came alive. Because they were
_actually alive_. The team could jump on the phone and chat with them. What
was impressive in this case was that the team had a much easier time moving
from the specific to the general. They noticed commonalities. We developed
generalized personas by going backwards — which essentially mimics how skilled
designers and marketers create personas in the first place. It was a good
example of experiencing the thinking process instead of mandating it.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*ojES-hr1w2MCd0qB.)

Starting with Fake Fake People rarely gets you to Real Fake People

### Salience

People can be extremely lazy with the types of media they use for personas.
And designers are often the main culprit. They’ll create complex and beautiful
persona templates while missing out on opportunities to use video, audio, and
work product samples (e.g. spreadsheets, forms, plans, etc.) The templates are
so rigid that any new learnings are impossible to incorporate. In short,
they’re made for Show, and not Tell. Cute for portfolios, but not so helpful
for teams.

> In short, they’re made for Show, and not Tell. Cute for portfolios, but not
so helpful for teams.

Let’s say you’ve interviewed ten people and you’re starting to find some
commonality around the technology usage dimension. Consider editing down clips
of video (or audio) for that dimension and splicing it back to back. This will
drive home the point with more salience and impact. Most importantly you’re
letting the team explore the connections instead of force-feeding your biased
summary of findings. Work backwards from the specific to the general, not the
other way around.

The granddaddy of persona fastracks is the “real world” customer visit. Rent a
van and go. I’m amazed by how few product managers, let alone engineers,
actually engage with their customers and users in their offices. Your precious
UX breaks down with eleven open browser tabs, interruptions every three
minutes, and a barking boss down the hall. No slick persona can replace this
experience … especially second hand through a UX researcher or product manager
proxy. Taking a full day off away from the screen might seem like a
productivity killer. But so is building things people will never use.

In a pinch video can work too if your org is pushing back, or if visiting
customers on site is impractical. At a former gig I filmed “confessional”
style videos with twenty odd customers/users. I set the context and lowered
the customer’s guard. No topics were off limits. The end result was “loved” by
even the staunchest persona haters. It felt “real”. The same held true for
monthly customer research panels where we invited customers to speak to a room
of 15–30 engineers over lunch. Even the staunchest persona-loathers enjoyed
these sessions (and the free lunch didn’t hurt).

### Salience Part II: The Story

What excites people more: 1) knowing how old a person is and that they like
puppies, or 2) knowing that a person saved a stray puppy from freezing water
on the eve of their 30th birthday during a freak ice-storm in Wisconsin?

Check out [the period table of
storytelling](http://www.designthroughstorytelling.net/periodic/) and get lost
for an afternoon.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*UPyBhXJbHufZFHYAga0Vng.png)

[Periodic Table of
Storytelling](http://www.designthroughstorytelling.net/periodic/)

The summary and bullet-pointed nature of personas is the persona achilles
heel. I remember interviewing a person who was caught in a terribly difficult
financial situation. He was terrified that he would let his elderly mother
down by mismanaging the property she had entrusted him to rent. Her care at
the assisted living facility depended on it. Now that’s real. No bullet point
can capture that. Playing the audio to the team captured it perfectly without
any platitudes about empathy.

This is why personas should be used in conjunction with customer journey maps
and other time-based visualizations and artifacts. Don’t feel limited by the
format or template of the personas. Consider storyboards, picture montages,
video montages, and more traditional journey maps.

Some of the caveats above still remain true. A “proto” customer journey map is
still a hypothesis. Making it more visual doesn’t solve that problem. But by
“working backwards” from qualitative research you can make this exercises pack
a bigger punch.

### Jobs To Be Done

Jobs-to-be-done is an interesting counterpoint to traditional personas and
something I’ve seen resonate with product development teams. I’m not sure I’m
a fan of doing away completely with personas, but I do think jobs-to-be-done
makes a great case for focusing less on the classic product marketing
wheelhouse of demographics and stateless, causality-lacking generalizations.

> These attributes, generally in the form of demographics, do not bring a team
closer to understanding a customer’s consumption, or non-consumption, of a
product. The characteristics of a Persona (someone’s age, sex, race, and
weekend habits) does not explain why they ate that Snickers bar; having 30
seconds to buy and eat something which will stave off hunger for 30 minutes
does explain why. ([Intercom](https://blog.intercom.io/using-job-stories-
design-features-ui-ux/))

With B2B you frequently encounter situations where you’ll have customer wear
different hats depending on the size of the company. Users are grouped by
needs and goals (both emotional and job-related). Imagine two CEOs, both with
similar demographics. The president of a small company might wear “all of the
hats”, while the CEO of a large company focuses on top-level decisions. The
SMB president embodies many jobs-to-be-done, least of which is trying to
manage the wrenching stress of overseeing a small business.

There is a subtle difference between

> “This person is stressed. This person is overworked.”

and

> “This person is hiring our product to reduce stress in their day and to work
more efficiently.”

A big word of caution is to put too much emphasis on official roles prescribed
in your product. What is an Administrator exactly? Are they all the same? Do
all Read Only visitors have the same needs? Don’t create personas directly
from your system-roles.

### Relationships Matter: No Persona Is An Island

A major failing of traditional personas is that they fail to describe
relationships. Relationships drive collaboration and interactions.
Relationships create product challenges that extend beyond the singular wants,
needs, and egos of individual people. And for the purpose of engaging teams
understanding relationships drives empathy and novel solutions.

Let’s say you have a golfer and a caddie. What are the inputs and outputs of
that relationship? The golfer is relying on the caddie for local knowledge and
emotional support when she shanks the ball into another fairway. The caddie is
relying on the golfer for money, for conversation (perhaps), and for regular
work. Both have a relationship with the Pro and other Golfers.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*J7yqiHDYAeKWpgk-.)

The relationship view is a much needed layer of understanding. The real
opportunities for products often exists along the edges … not at the nodes.
Work passes between people, not inside the confines of single personas. A
successful product addresses the needs of all parties. These diagrams don’t
fit into the neat and tidy persona templates, but they express a more
realistic set of assumptions.

### The Why

Observing humans is one of the great catalysts for invention and innovation.
It’s how you develop products that magically read the customer’s mind even if
they’ve asked for something entirely different. You notice the subtleties.
Your design decision batting average improves.

But as they stand personas have a bad rap. Framing personas merely on their
capacity to drive empathy is too short sighted. And frankly it also feels
elitist. It casts engineers as lacking empathy for users, when in fact they
rightfully lack an appetite for shoddy assumptions.

There’s a couple reasons why “experienced” cross-functional teams perform
better. The first is that they know when to trust and challenge their
intuition. The second is that they know how to ask better questions and that
staying curious is the key to the game. Third is that they combine techniques
and have mastered the core skills (“just code and deliver” below). Personas,
and their inherent ambiguity, definitely makes things more complicated at
first …

When working with an inexperienced team this can be a challenge for the UXer.
You know that the persona process can yield better, leaner, more simple, and
more effective product … but honestly it all feels a little hokey. Hopefully
the advice above helps, and I’d love to connect to learn what has worked for
you!

Don’t do personas for the heck of it. Build better products together.

### The Iron Triangle Is Dead

#### Illusions of singular org culture, intervention, and the “right way”

There is something very calming about doodling in a notebook. For me, Saturday
mornings is about doodles and coffee.

The [traditional Iron Triangle](http://www.projecttimes.com/articles
/traditional-iron-triangle-vs.-agile-triangle.html) has three nodes: Scope,
Resources, and Schedule. When you talk to executives they’ll describe their
central challenges as Growth, or Innovation, or both. As product developers
we’re supposed to decide between [Building The Right Thing, Build It Fast, and
Build The Thing Right](http://yedingding.com/images/deliver-better-
product-i/KnibergRoles.jpg?1404985052).

The reality is that there are far more things at play. Contrary to the
simplifications, there are no levers … but rather fields, sinew, arcs, push,
pull, momentum, complexity, and travel. Creativity is a journey. Scale has
multiple roots. Quality doesn’t just magically materialize.

This is what I came up with ([click here for high

### Focus Until It Hurts

To startup founders and early team members, focus can be extremely
uncomfortable. It defies many of our intuitions about customer-centricity,
risk mitigation, “working hard”, and seizing opportunities. We are by
definition opportunists and risk-takers and the list of good ideas is endless.

It’s easy to talk about focus. But much harder to BE focused.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*GEu1h17A6_pm_grHkXzv-g.png)

When the lights go up …. think of all the great things we could do!

It occurred to me the other day that what we call “focus” is often way too
comfortable. It’s a bandaid on the fleshwound. We resort to familiar thought
patterns and fixes:

  * Our meetings need to be more efficient! No meetings!
  * We need better tools!
  * We need to improve our ability to communicate!
  * We need better processes! We need more accountability!
  * We need rules around emailing, chatting, and documentation!
  * We need more resources!
  * We need to be more efficient!
  * We need to protect people from distractions!
  * We need to do more planning upfront!

This is not real focus. These things address the symptoms of poor focus, not
focus itself.

Enter the dichotomy. For the doers and those on the front-lines, real focus
feels amazing. You’re in the zone, making quick decisions, and building and
selling things customers love.

For managers, leaders, and other anointed decision-makers real focus can feel
extremely painful and counterintuitive. You have to push yourself far beyond
the point of comfort just to defeat your tendencies to chase waterfalls. It
should feel **very uncomfortable and awkward.**

So what does real focus feel like? How do we know? My suggestion is to look
carefully at the team and look for evidence. A focused team …

  * **Is Safe.** Their experiments are [safe to fail](http://bounds.net.au/node/15) and individuals are free from intimidation, harassment, and discrimination. The environment supports a [growth mindset](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/) and is supportive of different learning and communication styles. (See [Anzeneering](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/anzeneering/) by Joshua Kerievsky)
  * **Has Congruency. **There are no backchannels and [scuttlebutt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuttlebutt). Bad behavior is not tolerated for political reasons. The team shares a common reality — not by force or command, but because they share a common mission and narrow focus. When a conversation involves three people … then those three people are present and involved.
  * **Says No Often**: no to meetings, no to prospects, no to partnerships, no to new tools, no to process, no to feature requests, [no to customers](http://www.inc.com/young-entrepreneur-council/9-polite-ways-to-reject-a-customer.html), and no to second choice candidates. They say no so often that they end up saying it less. This isn’t a top-down No — the manager playing wackamole in a desperate attempt at control — but rather a whole-team habit.
  * **Says Yes Quickly**. Yes means Yes, not Maybe. Individual team members can make consistently good decisions without asking for permission, navigating politics, or needing “buy-in”. No one person owns the Yes, because with crisp focus anyone can say Yes confidently.
  * C**ommunicates Openly and Respectfully**. They’re able to “get real” and speak candidly. When it doubt they meet in person and resolve differences. Focused teams also spend a lot more time talking about what they’re actually DOING — the work and what it takes to get it done — than about wishy washy future plans and ideas.
  * **Has Fewer Constraints. **Humans are terrible at juggling “yeah but”s and “but we have to consider”s. When you add constraints you increase complexity and in turn decrease the chance of getting anything meaningful done.
  * **Works Less But Deliver Better Outcomes. **They exhibit an almost boring level of productivity. Stuff just “gets done” without a lot of heat and drama. But output isn’t the end goal. That output results in better outcomes for customers, co-workers, partners, etc.
  * **Feels Flow.** Distractions fade without command-and-control or efforts to promote “efficiency, accountability, and velocity”. They exude focus and a calm energy. Work is challenging, engaging, and energizing.

Instead of trying to control culture, look for these characteristics to nudge
things in the right direction. Challenge your own intuitions about what focus
looks/feels like, and regularly engage the team in assessing the current level
of focus. Push yourself to the limit — far beyond being “a little
uncomfortable” to the point of being ruthlessly focused — and stay the course.

### To Experiment Is Human. Reality is a **cker. And The Law Of Two Feet

#### Topics: Lean Startup, Millennials, Design Thinking, Cheap Vodka, Intuit,
Craft, and Call To Arms

Spend time with most product development teams these days and you are likely
to hear a lot of talk about assumptions, hypotheses, experiments, validation,
and “tests”. The[ Lean Startup glossary](http://venturenotebook.com/post/lean-
startup-terminology) permeates mainstream startup coffee urn chit-chat,
standups, and pitch decks. [Canvasses](http://www.lean-startup-coaching.com
/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/lean_canvas_visual_management.jpg) adorn hallway
walls. The A/B tests are humming! The spin-offs like LeanUX are doing great.
All hail intellectual rigor and the scientific method!

Reddit flash. Reality is a **cker.

Yes … liberté, égalité, fraternité: the experimentation Force is strong.
Experimentation and learning is hip and cool and the millennials dig it. It’s
like college or grad school never ended. You can work at a disruptive digital
widgeteer and continue to be creative, rigorous, and true to yourself. Battle-
weary forty-somethings like me dig it also because it lets me take my work to
a more impactful, and more challenging place. It promises fewer
[HIPPOs](http://www.forbes.com/sites/derosetichy/2013/04/15/what-happens-
when-a-hippo-runs-your-company/#51893ce24847) (highest paid person’s
opinions), more craft, more honesty, less politics, and less bullshit.

This stuff is a dream come true for the doers,
[crafters](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/), and renaissance
millennials. It jumps off the shelves.

Unfortunately, the Koolaid is spiked with some [wicked cheap
vodka](http://gizmodo.com/5966569/why-cheap-booze-makes-your-hangover-so-
horrible).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*ErUuStIXI2e1gL6s.)

Most organizations are structurally and culturally incapable of making it safe
for teams to experiment and occasionally fail. As companies progress out of
the do-or-die [Act 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-act_structure) of
their trajectory, their once open attitude to experimentation shifts to a
messy balancing act: making teams _believe_ they’re empowered to solve
problems (heck, it is great marketing and keeps the foosball table humming),
while at the same time executing on the assumptions and guesses of anointed
deciders.

Noise overwhelms signal, opinion overwhelms evidence, and the quest for output
overwhelms the quest for validated outcomes. What a terrible vodka hangover.
And that’s only the start …

Organizational fascia restricts movement and innovation, alignment
deteriorates, the pressure increases, the perceived need for control
increases, processes multiply, and the cycle reinforces itself (gotta love
complex systems). Experimentation and learning become afterthoughts. And then
the company accu-hires an innovation lab and starts doing hack days, longing
for its innocent childhood, skinned knees, bruises, and bright smiles (and
all).

Craig Larmen (of [LeSS fame](http://less.works/)) scared the crap out of me at
an Agile meetup in 2015. I asked him about “bottom up” change and he flatly
explained that doing change “halfway” is worse than no change at all. In
short, making people see the forest through the trees while cutting the forest
down is worse than no change at all. You incite the inherent tendency of the
masses to embrace impactful and honest work, while not being able to dislodge
the leadership hegemony. That was a buzzkill, but I couldn’t completely
discount his argument.

This is the let down oft reported by millennials after joining vibrant
startups only to have the magic carpet pulled out from under them. And also
experienced folks after realizing that some organizational-viruses never die.
There has to be a better way, no?

This stuff is hard. It’s not a game of lip-service.

Read Suzanne Pelican’s piece [Design thinking in the corporate
DNA](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/design-thinking-in-the-corporate-dna) to
understand the gumption required for deep structural change (at Intuit). Note
also that the initiative had deep roots in CEO [Scott Cook’s
commitment](https://hbr.org/2015/01/intuits-ceo-on-building-a-design-driven-
company) to “be considered one of the most design-driven companies in the
world” by 2020. Pelican’s mention of Eric Reiss isn’t a namecheck. Intuit
doesn’t phone in its commitment to a more intellectually honest and rigorous
approach. They live and breath it (for now). Pelican writes:

> A common trap for us is to take something in its infancy and try to scale it
big. Build it. Launch it. Move on. Well, it doesn’t work like that. Remember
how long it took before you mastered design thinking? This isn’t something
that you have people try once and then expect them to get it. It takes about
six to 10 experiential, immersive, contextually relevant experiences before
someone finally “gets” it and can make it their own. Eight years later, we’re
still building this skill into our employees, one experience at a time.

Contrast that with the rigor most companies put into their experiments,
canvasses, validation, and evidence-based approaches. When they hit the
inevitable letdown, they blame the tools and methods. Mistake!

Evidence-based approaches aren’t the problem. Lean Startup combines a number
of tested methodologies. Design thinking is a solid and very time-tested
problem solving approach. [BML](http://steveblank.com/2015/05/06/build-

We’re inundated with ways — under “ideal” circumstances — to build great
products people love. My Twitter feed swims in it. The summary is basically …
“I WISH I could spend my day working like this!” These methods are humane,
rigorous, curious, and failure safe.

And then you have the whole host of “cultural change” articles that explain
how to hack organizations to make them safer for things that work _to work_.
We all seemingly want the same thing, while the “real world” folks are drawing
gantt charts, setting KPIs, and selling stuff people don’t use.

What’s the point? I want to encourage crafters (buzzy, yes), hackers, “makers”
(buzzy, yes), designers, creatives, builders, and engineers to approach their
work with passion, rigor, and curiosity. To seek out places where you are
safe, and while those places are safe to build stuff that both excites you and
benefits people. Use the _law of two feet_ to live passionately and move where
you find value. Promote a diversity-friendly, learning-safe, and failure-safe
mindset, and work to create those environments for other people. Growth does
not always imply sacrifice … if you stick stubbornly to your values anything
is possible. Basically … don’t give up!

  * Show empathy NOT indifference
  * Ask why and who NOT how and what
  * Serve teams NOT agendas
  * Be guided by principles NOT plans
  * Be a team-member NOT a team-driver
  * Focus on challenges and needs NOT titles
  * Treat teammates like creative makers NOT resources
  * Provide context and data NOT solutions and platitudes
  * Have suggestions and opinions NOT demands and fiats
  * Be curious and open NOT dismissive and stubborn
  * Harness diversity NOT conformity
  * Embrace simplicity NOT oversimplification
  * Deliver outcomes and impact NOT features and output
  * Build less NOT more
  * Be transparent NOT opaque or manipulative
  * Be accessible NOT elusive or overbearing

### How I Forced Myself To Eat Healthy Food (For 40 Days)

I write some [long Medium posts](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/to-
experiment-is-human-reality-is-a-cker-and-the-law-of-two-feet-
639ade01396a#.79wai7rot). This isn’t one of them. I’ve been meaning to share a
simple hack that has helped me get back on the healthy eating wagon.

#### Step 1

Buy gift cards from healthy lunch places (and breakfast if you tend to eat
while on the go). My favorites while here in Raleigh, NC are [Happy +
Hale](http://order.happyandhale.com/) and [Joule](http://ac-
restaurants.com/joule/).

Go big. Really big. Like $500 big:

Convert the money to pieces of plastic:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*1Mv5uqL2jr9JS9AO46IS5Q.png)

#### Step 2

Take photos of your gift cards. You’ll be super pissed if you lose your wallet
along with $500 in healthy food.

#### Step 3

**Eat the food.** Why not? You’ve invested this much into eating healthy. You might as well. Each morning I get the Breakfast of Champions at Joule.

and for lunch, I have a salad and some protein from H+H.

That’s it. There is something about spending the money upfront that keeps you
motivated (for some people).


# Talking The Talk: 32 Conversation Prompts for Product Development Teams

Topics: Learning goals. Decisions. Collaboration. Data. Experimentation.
Personal passions. And respect for diverse viewpoints.

### Talking The Talk: 32 Conversation Prompts for Product Development Teams

#### Topics: Learning goals. Decisions. Collaboration. Data. Experimentation.
Personal passions. And respect for diverse viewpoints.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*h-fQGOKu14ZeE5Od7e4o4g.png)

[Arnold Lakhovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Lakhovsky "Arnold
Lakhovsky" ), _The Conversation_ (circa 1935)

I’ve noticed over the years that diverse teams that communicate clearly,
honestly, and respectfully will always beat homogenous teams that struggle
with a lack of focus, trust issues, and silencing minority viewpoints. We look
for quick fixes — a new methodology, a new process, a new structure — when our
biggest challenge is creating a safe environment for sharing diverse
viewpoints. And then, literally, learning how to communicate in those
settings. (I speak more about this in my post [To Experiment Is Human. Reality
is a **cker. And The Law Of Two Feet](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/to-
experiment-is-human-reality-is-a-cker-and-the-law-of-two-feet-
639ade01396a#.nle0kxrjr))

What do high-performing product development teams sound like? What do they
talk about? How do they stay so focused?

For a while now I’ve wanted to create a deck of cards teams could use to learn
to communicate more effectively in software product development team settings.
There is a lot of material out there to help teams collaborate and communicate
more generally, but I wanted to focus in on common product development
situations.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*8n-B9T5qiH_zx6RKOivOTg.png)

So here’s the first iteration …

#### Tips For Facilitators

  * **Print** the prompts and examples on card stock and make your own cards (much cheaper than Avery index card labels)
  * Create **a safe space** that is friendly to curiosity, passion, and empathy. Set the scene by reminding participants that there are no stupid answers
  * **Scope the discussion**. Pick a specific product development effort
  * Underscore that as a team you’re **practicing patterns** that can be applied in new settings. So there is a specific application — the effort at hand — and more general applications
  * **Use the cards as you see fit**: team members can pick from the top, work as groups on a set of cards, get dealt cards, “pass the trash” to get answers from other people, etc.

#### Tips For Team Members

Be specific whenever possible. Relate things to your observations, your
experience, your perspectives, and your needs. Be in the present. Discuss the
current situation and decisions at hand. Be honest with your intentions. Stay
curious.

When in doubt, remember the STATE acronym (from [Crucial Conversations Tools
for Talking When Stakes Are
High](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K0AYH4/ref=dp-kindle-
redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1)):

  * **S**hare your facts
  * **T**ell your story
  * **A**sk for others’ paths
  * **T**alk tentatively
  * **E**ncourage testing

### The Prompts

And here they are … to be improved, but “in print”

* * *

I’m concerned that if we **________**, we may miss the opportunity to
**________**.

Example: I’m concerned that if we **spend too long deliberating over the
behavior of the page filter**, we may miss the opportunity to **test early
with customers**.

* * *

To feel more confident about our decision to **________**, I would like to
observe **________**

Example: To feel more confident about our decision to **add steps to the

My primary reason for advocating for **________** is that I care deeply about
**________**

Example: My primary reason for advocating for **the enhanced error messaging**
is that I care deeply about **the user experience, and preventing customer
frustration**

A missing voice here is the voice of **________.** This will heavily impact**
________.** We should explore **________** perspective

Example: A missing voice here is the voice of **Roger from customer success.**

them with a difficult to use feature.** We should explore **his** perspective

* * *

I feel strongly that if we **________** it will negatively impact **________**
by **________**

Example: I feel strongly that if we **release without IE support** it will
negatively impact **our less technically savvy customers** by **introducing a

on focusing the team

Example: In my opinion, learning more about** the customer mental model for
organizing their scheduled meetings** would have the greatest impact on
focusing the team

* * *

One way to test this “in the wild” (with live customers and their data) would
be to **________**. By capturing data on **________ **we could decide whether
to **________**.

Example: One way to test this “in the wild” (with live customers and their
data) would be to **create a feature toggle and show a small % of our
customers the new functionality**. By capturing data on **column sorting
behavior** we could decide whether to **optimize our queries**.

* * *

Before adding **________** I’d like to learn more about **________** so that I
can decide **________**

Example: Before adding **a new API endpoint** I’d like to learn more about
**any potential customer security concerns** so that I can decide **whether to
anonymize visitor data in the response**

* * *

The most valuable learning we could take from this project and leverage in
other areas of the product would be the fact that **________**. An immediate
application of that learning would be to **________**.

Example: The most valuable learning we could take from this project and
leverage in other areas of the product would be the fact that **our users
select system roles that are far out of alignment with their actual “real
world” roles**. An immediate application of that learning would be to **try to
survey our users to capture their “real world” roles**.

* * *

A blindspot in our current understanding is whether **________. **To learn
more about this we could **________** and observe **________**.

Example: A blindspot in our current understanding is whether **our customers
really need XLS export instead of a simple CSV export. **To learn more about
this we could **add a dummy option for XLS export to the existing menu** and
observe **how many people select it who previously were not using our CSV
export option**.

* * *

A signal that would serve as a leading indicator of success in this situation
would be that we noticed **________**. As things ramped up I’d expect to see
**________**, with data indicating a **________**.

Example: A signal that would serve as a leading indicator of success in this
situation would be that we noticed **more users exploring and testing the new
Appointments tab**. As things ramped up I’d expect to see **a small set of
users adopt the auto-scheduler**, with data indicating a **shift of between
80–100% of their appointments away from manual scheduling**.

* * *

In the past I have observed that **________**. This impacts my current point
of view on our decision to **________**

Example: In the past I have observed that **our customers have very different
behaviors when visiting our app from a mobile device **. This impacts my
current point of view on our decision to **expand the primary navigation with
more items**

* * *

At the end of the day, I’d really like to say that I **________**. That’s the
personal contribution I care most about. As a team, I’d hope we’d **________**
with data showing **________**.

Example: At the end of the day, I’d really like to say that I **got the
endless scroll working smoothly**. That’s the personal contribution I care
most about. As a team, I’d hope we’d **make the whole feed experience more
user-friendly** with data showing **increased repeat engagement**.

* * *

The next important decision I need to make is to decide whether to
**________**, or to **________**

Example: The next important decision I need to make is to decide whether to
**spend more time optimizing page load time**, or to **move on to refactoring
the image resizing logic**

* * *

I primarily want to contribute by **________**. I’d prefer to be less involved
with** ________**

Example: I primarily want to contribute by **listening in on some customer
interviews**. I’d prefer to be less involved with** observing usability
testing**

* * *

While I trust Amira to decide **________**, I think that decision would
benefit from us having more data about **________ **because** ________**

Example: While I trust Amira to decide **whether to continue iterating on the
address book**, I think that decision would benefit from us having more data
about **current usage among power users **because** power users have many more
contacts**

* * *

I could contribute more if I understood exactly why **________** are
advocating for **________**

Example: I could contribute more if I understood exactly why **Dan and Trish**
are advocating for **the inclusion of trial customers in the on-boarding
experiment**

* * *

From my perspective, the riskiest assumption we are making at the moment is
**________**. If we’re wrong, that will impact us by **________**.

Example: From my perspective, the riskiest assumption we are making at the
moment is **that users will recommend the service so quickly**. If we’re
wrong, that will impact us by **making it difficult to hit our user
acquisition targets**.

* * *

It feels as if the greatest tension here is between **________** and
**________**

Example: It feels as if the greatest tension here is between **shipping early
to meet the end of quarter sales objective** and **spending more time on
enhancing the feature to please existing customers**

* * *

The area we have the hardest time establishing a shared understanding around
is whether our** ________** need to** ________** in order for them to
**________**

Example: The area we have the hardest time establishing a shared understanding
around is whether our** customers** need to** have access to the edit
history** in order for them to **find value in the proposed MVP**

* * *

An example of something I care deeply about is **________**. While I respect
those that do care about **________**, I don’t find myself caring as much
about those things.

Example: An example of something I care deeply about is **the extensibility of
our code**. While I respect those that do care about **the use of micro-
interactions and new UI patterns**, I don’t find myself caring as much about
those things.

* * *

By spending less time focusing on **________** and more time focusing on
**________** I think we could **________**

Example: By spending less time focusing on **supporting different payment
types** and more time focusing on **the speed of payment processing** I think
we could **improve the current user experience without adding undue
complexity**

* * *

I’d be comfortable having **________** decide **________** provided I could
**________**

Example: I’d be comfortable having **Parrisa** decide **whether we switch
reporting frameworks** provided I could **attend a meeting with the options
clearly described including benefits and risks**

One way to get out of our own heads here would be to **________**

Example: One way to get out of our own heads here would be to **test the three
options with customers at the conference tomorrow**

* * *

Spending too much time on **________**, and not enough time **________,**
might result in us **________**

Example: Spending too much time on **refining the information architecture of

**support custom fields**.

* * *

Playing devil’s advocate, I’m not sure we are taking **________** into
consideration. A benefit of focusing there might be that we could avoid
**________**.

Example: Playing devil’s advocate, I’m not sure we are taking **seasonal

might be that we could avoid **making UI enhancements based solely on behavior
at the end of Q4.**

* * *

The personal experience that is most driving my intuition here is** ________**
with a **________ **in the **________** domain.** **My greatest learning from
that prior experience was that we should consider** ________**

Example: The personal experience that is most driving my intuition here is**
the time I attempted to nudge users to use tags instead of folders** with a
**B2B SaaS product **in the **advertising** domain.** **My greatest learning
from that prior experience was that we should consider** the mental models of
our less tech-forward users**

* * *

I would happily pay **________** right now if I could see more data about
**________**. This would help inform how **________**

Example: I would happily pay $**1000** right now if I could see more data
about **customer search behavior and its impact on time in-app**. This would
help inform how **we might define success for this initiative. Are we trying
to increase or decrease time in-app ?**

* * *

Our most valuable learning to date is that **________** . We can leverage this
learning now by **________**

Example: Our most valuable learning to date is that **customers rarely check
their email for feature updates** . We can leverage this learning now by
**trying some different ways to present update notifications in-app**


# Getting The All-Hands Right

Can you really run an effective all-hands meeting each week? Is it worth it?

* * *

### **Getting The All-Hands Right**

Can you really run an effective all-hands meeting each week? Is it worth it?

I think so. Meetings don’t kill companies. Valueless meetings kill companies
(and individual motivation). In 1999, what was Google thinking? Shouldn’t they
have been working?

In this post I offer some tips for all-hands meetings. They’re biased to my
experiences and personal viewpoints.

#### **How Often?**

I read [this answer on Quora](https://www.quora.com/In-startups-how-often-
should-you-have-all-hands-team-meetings) that fired my spidey sense:

> Meetings pull people off of **important tasks **and **slow productivity**.
If people aren’t on the same page, I would look at project management and
other management techniques being used in the organization and have team
leaders convey **important informatio**n. I would use the all hands meeting
for only big things like a **merger, change in benefits, serious HR issues**.

Hmmm. Is productivity the goal? Or efficacy? What are these “management
techniques”? Should “team leaders” be the sole conduits for “important
information”. And imagine how cool that meeting will be when they announce the
merger, change the benefits, or address the serious HR issues. Joy!

I’m not about to say that weekly meetings are must. That’s a big investment
and something you need to work hard to make valuable. But I would suggest
holding them MORE often than is immediately comfortable. Stick to your guns.
They can be improved and be made more valuable. Here are some examples (and
stories) of companies that hold weekly meetings:

  * Google (Alphabet): [Weekly](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/passion-not-perks.html)
  * Pardot: [Weekly](http://davidcummings.org/2016/01/21/develop-a-meeting-rhythm/)
  * Twitter: [Weekly “Tea-Time](http://mashable.com/2016/01/29/twitter-employees-rally/#boBjCdveU5qy)”. Note the situation in this link:

[Source](https://twitter.com/WillStick/status/692775729235296256/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

#### **Be Proactive. Not Reactive**

It’s painfully obvious when leaders are holding an all-hands to address rising
discontent vs. holding to a cadence. If there is not enough regular “news”,
then you’re likely not moving quickly enough or creating enough impact. Stick
to a cadence and defend it. [David Karp (Tumblr founder and CEO) was quoted as
saying](http://bijansabet.com/post/16814688304/weekly-all-hands-meeting):

> One of my biggest regrets is waiting until we were about 20 people to start
holding regular weekly All Teams. Getting up there in front of so many people
I adored was overwhelming, and my first attempt was hardly inspiring. I
realized I could have had three years of practice, and a chance to work my way
up to the big team, if I’d started earlier.

#### Don’t Micromanage The Message. Let It Emerge.

Myth, ritual, and narrative are incredibly powerful, but they are difficult to
manufacture or fake. Ask carefully … what priorities are you truly embodying
(and mythologizing) in your all-hands meetings? What is the story? What is the
talk that is walked?

Executives often see all-hands meetings as “alignment builders”. The advice is
to keep it “efficient”, stick to the agenda, and monitor every word to “stay
on message”. To many employees this will come off as too slick and controlled.
Let it be messy. Let it be unscripted. Tell the story. Connect. An “efficient”
meeting message can be easily communicated by other means. But myths, ritual,
and narratives can’t.

<http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/anthropology/21a-212-myth-ritual-and-symbolism-
spring-2004/>

#### **Engage Introverts (And Mere Mortals)**

Only the most vocal people will speak up in front of the whole company. How do
you engage the mere mortals and the introverts? Set up an anonymous
“topic/question inbox” and always address one (or more) of these issues.
Always. Make them public before the meeting. Relying on your direct reports to
communicate back the water cooler talk is a risky proposition. Go straight to
the source.

#### **Skip Status-Checky Stuff**

Don’t waste time communicating financials or dry progress-to-goal updates.
This is far better communicated in a shared presentation or email. Or video.
Those interested in the nuts and bolts will read on their own time. The time
is too precious for relaying information that is equally comprehensible (or
perhaps MORE comprehensible) in written form. Why isn’t this information
simply available for all who care?

The risk of communicating this in meetings is that you’ll either oversimplify
for the audience — missing valuable angles — or go over most people’s heads.
Hit the key points and move on. Focus on the important variances.

#### **Share The Stage**

Let non-executives / non-managers speak for 40–60% of the time. They are your
rockstars. This sends the right message. Inspiration can come from all areas
of the company. I’ve seen UXers, Business Analysts, Marketers, Engineers, and
Salespeople absolutely wow large companies. Consider that Google allocates 50%
of all-hands time to QA.

Who will share the stage?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*e-8U0wBLxOm_4aDly-PrBQ.png)

<http://www.uxforthemasses.com/improve-ux-presentations/>

#### **No Tech Issues**

Deal with technical issues when involving remote workers. Have a backup
option. Test the equipment. Have an open chat. Use quality microphones. Get a
good quality video camera. It all matters.

#### **Record The Meeting**

On any given day you’ll have team members sick, on the road, or otherwise
unavailable. You might also have virtual employees in a different timezone.
Don’t leave them out. A side benefit is that you can go back and critique how
the meeting flowed. To engage their remote employees and leave them feeling
like part of the team, [HelpScout replaced their all-hands with a video
update](https://www.helpscout.net/blog/video-updates/).

#### **Share Wins, Losses, and Learnings**

It is incredibly important to make vulnerability, failure, and learning from
your mistakes “safe” in your organization. Doing so in public sends a strong
message, especially if leaders address their own missteps. Vulnerability (and
humor) brings people together.At Etsy, [all-hands meetings begin with an
opening talent act by an employee](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-etsy-
does-all-hands-meetings-2015-6). That’s a sign of a safe environment.
Information should move both ways.

General Stanley McChrystal (leader of the Joint Special Operations Task Force
from to 2003 until 2008) was known to run inspiring **DAILY** huddles. How did
he make those meetings valuable? [An INC magazine describes his
strategy](http://www.inc.com/ilan-mochari/genearl-mcchrystal-meetings.html):

> _By continuing to share his own news — good and bad — and being
nonjudgmental toward the other brave sharers. He also made the meetings as
fast — and filled with can’t-miss discussions — as they could possibly be. If
a particular individual had a four-minute speaking slot, the “update” portion
of his slot was limited to the first minute. The rest was open-ended dialogue,
which Silverman says helped “in creating a shared consciousness.” That is, the
units began to learn more about how their own projects fit in with the whole.
Moreover, the updates had to be about the present day. “No one wanted to hear
what you’d done in the last war,” the co-authors write._

#### **Make The Meeting Optional**

There should be no stigma around missing the all-hands. Some people simply
don’t care. Meetings just aren’t their thing. Others have lost interest. And
that’s a valuable data point.

#### **Return To Past Issues**

Have teams “groom” a small set of initiatives that deserve a regular update.
Keep this list fluid and relevant. But return to old topics to provide an
update. One common complaint about all-hands is that they aren’t “two way” and
don’t answer prior questions. If you mention a projection in an earlier
meeting, make sure to close the loop. This gives an expectation of
continuitity. Topics come full circle.

#### **Mind The Timing**

Monday’s tend to drag. Teams are not in the right headspace to tackle a
lengthy meeting with a big workweek ahead of them. Mornings beat sleepy
afternoons. Friday afternoons are a wash. “Branch day” can cause major
distractions for dev teams. You’ll never find the perfect time, but there are
terrible times. Avoid them.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*5N3Mi-F-feSfrH33S08WzA.png)

<https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/ahotbrewwillseeyouthrough>

#### **Meeting, Measure, Learn**

Typical negative responses to all-hands meetings include “too frequent”, “not
relevant”, “no new information, and “boring”. This is vague and hard to
quantify. Instead, send out regular anonymous surveys regarding the all-hands
meeting and monitor trends in those results. The kneejerk response to these
surveys is to make the meetings less frequent. Instead, consider sharing
meeting feedback at a subsequent all-hands and take steps to adapt and
experiment.

What has worked for you? When a frequent all-hands meetings not a good idea?
What do you do if the meetings simply don’t drive value?

### A Better Roadmap | Mind-Map | Mousetrap

#### This post is a summary of [this video on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8Xlrd2QGmU&feature=youtu.be). Check
it out!

Hint: Open in YouTube for a larger HD view.

* * *

Have you ever heard (or said) the following:

> “I don’t understand the big picture!”

> “I don’t understand how my work fits into the big picture!”

> “We are working in opposition to each other. We need better alignment”

We know the standard solutions. How about a better roadmap? Or a list of major
goals? Or another company all-hands? Or a new mousetrap?

### **The Problem**

Strategy/roadmaps overviews:

  * rarely explain rationale
  * differentiate assumptions and facts, or degrees of certainty
  * fail to explain causality, and linkages
  * fail to link tactics and strategy

They tend to read like a list of to-dos.

**Things slip.** Despite our best efforts it is difficult to understand the “big picture”. The strategy lacks coherence. We slip into the weeds of horse-trading pet solutions and the “why” is quickly forgotten. This in turn saps creativity and focus, as teams clash and generate noise. Most insidiously, it becomes nearly impossible to understand the root assumptions behind high level goals and individual interpretations. Shared understanding is never captured adequately. Laying it all against a calendar doesn’t help. Reviewing it doesn’t help.

### **The (Proposed) Solution**

In this post I’ll present a mind-mapping method to create that shared
understanding. While technically it is pretty simple, this level of
transparency can be challenging. It isn’t for everyone. But if you push
through, you’ll end up with a far richer understanding of what underpins the
roadmap or strategy. Why does this approach work?

  * It provides an “audit” of our reasoning
  * It explains our logic, assumptions, and data
  * It can be viewed at multiple “resolutions” for clarity
  * It “nests” well … the form can be nested inside itself

#### **The Basics**

Most goals have a “why”, some constraints, and some proposed solutions. I call
these Because, While/Without, and By. We’ll repeat these throughout the mind-
map.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*nzHBM1ylBXCLtK2K.)

Goals, Because (Why), While/Without, and By

#### An Example

I’m short on cash and my friend is coming to town tomorrow.

#### **Because**

I need to make $70 by tomorrow evening so I can take my visiting friend Bill
out to dinner. This is my “why”. We use “because” as it helps us form coherent
sentences inside the mind-map.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*ArYivwgy1VlOI8Jc.)

We specify a Because

#### **While / Without**

These are not solutions, but they guide our selection of a solution. We use
“without” when we assume or know we don’t want to (or can’t) do something. We
use “while” when we assume or know that we will do something alongside the
solution. Here I list some potential constraints:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*Or107y94C41XPzIF.)

We list our constraints

#### **While / Without Because**

Each of these constraints has an underlying assumption. We make sure to
differentiate between things we know, and things we assume. For example, I
can’t do physical labor because I **know **I hurt my back. I **assume** travel
could be expensive (or too time consuming), but who knows … maybe a friend
will give me a ride. We specify these using the following format:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*82X3iALLAwDRW1pV.)

Each of these constraints has their own assumptions

#### **By**

Now that we have a clear understanding of the why and constraints, we dream up
some potential solutions. We could start a lemonade stand, do some freelance
web work, or borrow the money.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*s7ekH2oKdVA07wQ3.)

Potential solutions

Lemonade Stand is looking like a good option. I repeat our **Because / While-
Without / By** form for this solution.

#### **Because and While/Without**

The forecast says it will be hot tomorrow. And I’d like to avoid using
powdered lemonade … first because I hate the taste myself, and second because
I assume people will feel cheated. Again I start with Because and
While/Without. I hate the taste of powdered lemonade (and I think it will
leave customers bummed) so I make sure to specify that:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*CbdL-yVEBKLksRAY.)

It looks like the weather will be hot. And I hate the taste of powdered
lemonade

#### **By and By ___ Because**

Our “solution” also has solution details, and these have underpinning
assumptions. In this case I’ve made an assumption about what I can charge, my
overhead, my location, and my product (fresh squeezed lemonade). My assumption
is that $1 will hit the sweetspot.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*3H-cvImu_R5evCO0.)

Our solutions ALSO have underlying assumptions

#### **Overview**

Here is the completed mind-map for my goal of making $70 today. This could be
easily handed to someone and the story would be told.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*kAn3K-9R1cLf06vL.)

Going from a goal of making $70 to the details of the lemonade stand

### **Real-World Example**

This can be applied to many types of business (and general problem solving)
situations:

Take a SaaS company hoping to hit an ARR (annual recurring revenue) goal.
Because sale’s goals are finicky and potential disruptive, we balance the goal
with constraints. In this example we make sure to point out that we don’t want
to sacrifice employee morale, or to stop innovating.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*J5g-RFZoXxRw7cNV.)

Sales Goals are potentially dangerous unless mitigated

We add assumptions to those constraints. In this case the sales goal is offset
by a limit on the acceptable level of professional services income, first
because it might distract the team, and second because it could sap employee
morale.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*hzHHgN5-wieIblQq.)

Turns out that some revenue isn’t investor friendly

We add other constraints including employee morale, continuing innovation, and
the all important churn/renewal goal (to offset overly ambitious sales
tactics). And then we proceed to list solutions. We start with Sales and
Marketing, but would eventually list product initiatives.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*APW7dSWMSz6fxWku.)

With the constraints listed, we move on to the proposed solutions

* * *

And that’s that. It isn’t complicated … but it requires patience and
conversation. Using this format can help a team battle voids in shared
understanding and come up with something that is coherent and actionable.

Please let me know if this works for you!


# Team Health: A Daily Checkup

* * *

### Team Health: A Daily Checkup

I hear people talking all the time about “measuring” product development
teams. Do we measure velocity, value delivered, or bugs removed / introduced?
But what if you flipped the script? What if teams devised their own daily
check-in to gauge their performance? What if they focused on great leading
indicators of success and health, and used those measures to guide continuous
improvement efforts?

I think you’d see something very different emerge. As individuals we care for
our health. As teams we should do the same.

Here’s a simple model for a daily check-in. [I’ve created a spreadsheet
version in Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hUet-
D9RLR7ctg6-KW9SNNrYRbL5-zYwt9eCYxLbokE/edit?usp=sharing). Feel free to make a
copy of it and use as you see fit.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*Q7NvVjfvs3dvDzOe.)

Find this spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hUet-
D9RLR7ctg6-KW9SNNrYRbL5-zYwt9eCYxLbokE/edit?usp=sharing)

I’ve included the questions below with some background. The spreadsheet has a
simple weighted scoring system.

* * *

**Today our team:**

**Had two hours of uninterrupted time to work? **How can any team function if their time is being continuously interrupted? Before you know it the whole day has slipped away. Two hours is an ideal chunk of time. Hammering out two chunks of two hours each is a major accomplishment in a distraction-filled environment.

**Had a conversation with a customer (or group of customers) involving &gt;1 member of your team? **Why silo the front-line from customers? It may seem more efficient to let people act as an interface. But in my experience that just encourages hoarding of data, and introduces signal loss as information is filtered through to the builders and makers. Regular contact with customers improves intuition and encourages empathy.

**Discussed facts about customer needs, usage, etc.(vs. assumptions, guesses, predictions)?** Are your meetings filled with guesses? Guesses are cheap. Shift the conversation to facts and data and meetings suddenly become a lot more productive (and even fun).

**Learned something new? **If the team is not learning — about customers, the domain, their technology, or themselves — then they’re slipping backwards. Learning new things is stimulating. It makes your current job worth it, and sends you packing if it isn’t happening.

**Applied a recent learning**? To hone a skill you must apply it. Did you apply a recent learning today? Not something you learned in high school — that’s cool too — but something you learned in the last couple weeks.

**Had an energetic / whole-team discussion about something related to work (&gt;10 minutes)? **We’ve all experienced those spontaneous conversations with our team. They aren’t forced. They need no official meeting to emerge. Everyone just spins around in their chair and starts having a good face-to-face conversation.

**Celebrated a win that resonated on a professional and personal level? **Most milestones don’t really resonate. A sense of impact is largely personal. How many team members experienced a win today?

**Felt in the “zone”, a state of flow, challenged but effective?** [Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29) is a great feeling. Time flies. The work is challenging but achievable. You don’t feel like you’re trashing. Anti-flow comes in many forms — negative dynamics, interruptions, lack of mission, and poor tooling. How many members of your team were in the “zone” today? In my experience this is contagious. When it’s “game on” everyone benefits.

**Participated in some kind of pairing activity? **Structured pairing can feel oppressive (especially if forced and mandated). But working alongside someone for some period of time can be a positive experience. Doing this cross-functionally (UX and engineering, for example) can yield awesome results.

**Had an honest discussion about what has and what has not been working (&gt;10 minutes)**? Can the team “be real”. Did they get real? If so, this is a good sign. It is almost impossible to continuously improve if their is not a level of openness, trust, and safety.

**Made some sort of high leverage, reusable, accessible, and necessary contribution (internal facing)? **Not all work is customer facing. Sometimes we take the bull by the horns and improve an internal tool, or process. The work has a large benefit for the rest of the team.

**Enjoyed a moment of brevity and humor, experienced by a majority of team members simultaneously?** Have fun! The other day a joke on our team started on Slack and ended in a full team laugh. That’s powerful. If you can’t have fun together, it is unlikely you’ll be able to weather the dips of product development.

How would you adapt this list for your environment? Let me know if the

# How To Tame Engineers, Be A Rockstar, and Ship ****ing Product

Introduction

* * *

### How To Tame Engineers, Be A Rockstar, and Ship ****ing Product

### Introduction

As product managers it is time we take a stand. Times are changing, and not in
our favor. DevOps, UX, Agile, Design Thinking, Growth Hacking, Data Science …
WTF? When did we lose our hold of the reigns? We need to fight back. We need
to regain our honor. We need to ship ****ing product. And to do that we need
to learn how to control engineers.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*k0DySgE8CxPlO_h3zIBX4g.png)

Tom Cruise as Frank T.J. Mackey in Magnolia

Engineers start their careers with a spark. They want to build things that
make a difference. The problem is that their caring and passion causes a lot
of problems. It slows us down. It makes being a manager of product, um,
challenging. Is there an alternative?

Yes!

Our goal here is to have engineers care about engineering, but not get in our
way. In other words, care enough to keep working very hard, but not to ask too
many questions or push back. To be successful we want engineers to relish
their craft, and to take pleasure delivering exactly what we want them to
deliver.

I’m going to share a secret. Engineers have a defense mechanism. They like
building things and they like writing code. Engineers can exist wonderfully
without really having any say in the product. Things will be rough at first.
They’ll huff and puff and complain about the product team, and then go home
and pick out an outfit for Comic-Con. It will pass. And your agenda will
remain unscathed. Why? Because they genuinely love what they do. How novel.

Yes. This is your Product School. Here are the keys to the kingdom. I feel
almost dirty sharing these time-honored secrets. Learn the skills below and
you’ll smash any desire to meddle.

You will ship ****ing product.

### **1\. Master Of Ceremony**

Conduct very elaborate ceremonies! Some teams have “sprint demos”. These are a
perfect vehicle to exert your power and influence. Deliberate slowly as the
team demos each feature. Really play up the fact that you’re the “approver”.
Use this opportunity to make it uncomfortable for engineers who fall out of
line. Relish in the approver role. Toss in a bit of discouragement here and
there along with some barely believable encouragement. Remember, we’re trying
to incubate productive apathy here folks.

### 2\. International Woman Of Product Mystery

Let’s face it it. You spend a lot of your day in boring meetings. But why
spill the beans? Add some mystery. Disappear into available conference rooms,
cell-phone in hand. You have to cultivate a persona here, which means the no
one wants to hear about you checking Facebook while you wait for GoToMeeting
to load. Or giving status checks to people who can’t be bothered to read a
tweet-length email update. No. You are an International Woman Of Product
Mystery, and meetings are where the action really happens.

### 3\. Own Your Stakeholders

Giving the team too much access to stakeholders is simply unacceptable. How
will you ever cultivate your soft skills? You, and only you, “manage” the
stakeholders. When it helps your cause — for example you want to impress a
stakeholder with your smart engineer friends — then it is appropriate to
mingle.

Invite stakeholders to the sprint demo as well. The key here is owning the
channel. Protect it at all costs. One slick tip here is to constantly
reiterate to the team how little these business types know about software
development. Huff a little. Complain about marketing being marketing, and
sales being sales. No one will want to deal with these folks after you are
done. You will OWN the channel. I promise.

### 4\. Pressure Applied Unevenly

Pressure should not work both ways. Take test-driven development. We ask
engineers to test software, and make sure things work. This is binary. It
works, or it doesn’t work. That rigor is uncomfortable, and not something we
want to experience. That is their world, not your world. Features don’t tank.
They “miss the mark”. Priorities shift because that’s how the world works, not
because we were too busy fixing our Mac after we broke everything trying to
install Python. We are the fortune tellers. We are the soothsayers. Our work
does not “pass” or “fail”. Make this clear, and you’ll dash interest in our
side of the house.

### 5\. Own The Problem. Choose The Solution

“We own defining the problem!” By assigning yourself the noble task of
defining the problem, you’ve basically written yourself a pass. Understanding
the domain is our business. It’s our special skillset. The engineers are
crafters and builders. They are the solvers (or at least they think so). Lucky
for us it is possible to turn our pet solutions into problem definitions. We
can tire the team out until they acknowledge our genius. The irony here is
that we never really truly understand the problem to solve, and our solution
often informs other problems. But that’s a detail. It’s too complicated. There
are problem definers, and solution builders, and we know our destiny. Control
both!

### 6\. Hackdays. Mother Of Pragmatism

Hackdays are great for hiring videos and angst deflection. When people start
giving you a hard time about your pet projects, make sure to remind them about
the upcoming hackday. Hackdays signal innovation. And fun. And kegerators. And
a sense of unbridled impact. But common sense says … every day can’t be like
hackday because that would be anarchy! People would build things quickly and
deliver them to customers within 5 days or 24hrs. PMs would be out of a job.
Let hackday be your carrot. Dangle it. A couple cycles of the harsh comedown —
that moment when you return from hackday to your unglamorous sales-driven
feature request — and your engineers will be compliant.

### 7\. Tamper With The Evidence

Censor all feedback that will invalidate your case. Crush it like Joe
McCarthy. Scan that feedback and filter out all disconfirming data. We may
live in a democracy, but since when is democracy transparent? Opacity is the
goal. The project is airtight. Customers have been consulted. The stars have
aligned. Our intuition reigns supreme. Please follow my lead.

### 8\. They Call This “Experimentation”

Everyone wants to experiment! They experimented in the 60s. Engineers are
science minded people. They love rigor. Use this to your advantage by
suggesting that people do exactly what you want them to do as an experiment.
Then don’t follow up on whether the experiment was successful or not. It’s
awesome! You get what you want right away, but leave people a tad bitter about
experimentation. They’ll withdraw back into their craft and code, leaving
endless product management possibilities.

### 9\. Voce del Cliente

Tout up models that cast product as the “voice of the customer”. Product
people love people (of course). Engineers love machines. Engineers don’t
really understand people, otherwise they wouldn’t be engineers. We love
people. If we didn’t we could be engineers also. But we love people too much.
Please, get with the stereotypes.

You want people to be a little scared of engineers. What would we do if we
didn’t have product managers here to keep them building the right stuff?
Remember that one time an engineer went rogue with a feature? Exactly. We run
the risk of that happening at all times. It is a constant threat.

### 10\. Flat Is Unfriendly. I’ll Have A Tall …

We want to play up politics in our organization. A flat company is unfriendly
to product managers. What would we do all day if we weren’t playing telephone
between all of these holders-of-stake? Sure we want a happy environment.
That’s great. More work gets done. But we want to foster a glass ceiling of
sorts. Engineers … resistance is futile. Don’t stress trying to rock the boat.

### 11\. The Project Factory, Estimates, and Velocity

We need estimates even if those estimates are always wrong. When things take
longer than expected we can always blame the team. Measure velocity as well!
Because velocity is the only thing coming between you and your next killer
release. The beauty here is that it all distracts people from measuring YOU!

Optimize your team 24–7. Push them to the brink of overutilization. Shift them
off of efforts over and over again just to eek out every little moment of
slack. If you do this enough they’ll just expect that you’re going to do that
… and you’ll be able to pull them off of future projects at a moment’s notice.

Status checks make people feel like they are working on a factory line. And we
like that. Because we value delivery. A well timed status check can sink
hearts. But they’ll come around … because they’ll start playing the game as
well! Remember, keep your eyes on the prize. Shipping ****ing product.

Work with UX to get things designed way in advance. That way you can show up
the morning after a big push — when everyone is eager for the data, and to
start iterating — and then announce the NEXT project. There’s no time for
dawdling. Those Mocks need building. Someone has to get that work done!
Announce confidently that the team is at risk of missing the “market window”.
“We just have to execute!”

### 12\. Data Is Not My Mistress (I Love PPT)

De-prioritize collecting data. Data has a tricky way of shining a light on
what you’re doing, and we don’t want that. What you DO want is to selectively
pick out the data points that let you do exactly what you want to do.
Transparency is not the goal. Take control of the tools. Own the analytics
software. Hold the keys. There is a major exception … at the end of a project
when somehow you cherry pick a wonderful up-and-to-the-right chart for the
board deck. Ride that freighttrain to a new job in biz-dev or market
validation.

### 13\. You Say Debt. I Say …

When teams talk about technical debt, usability debt, the national debt, the
debt limit, debtors, or anything else debt-related make sure to look a bit
distracted. Wax poetically about needing to pay the piper. And then pass the
debt on to the next generation. Or throw them a bone and do a greenfield
project until they get bored of that because DevOps is busy with the “main”
environment.

### 14\. MVPs

A great way to level set expectations with a team is to ship a super crappy
feature that no one is excited about (known as the MVP). Promise that you’ll
iterate on it, but don’t iterate on it. This is sneaky. Because on one hand
the concept of an MVP — as an experiment, and a way to deliver an early
hypothesis — is appealing to engineers. So you get their hopes up! But then
dash them. “MVPs that get iterated on only happen in the movies”. We do real,
pragmatic work here. Namely shipping what I want to ship.

### 15\. Hard Skills Are For Folks On The Spectrum

Don’t pick up too many hard skills. Especially around data science or other
things like that. Because then you’ll actually be needed by the team, and that
will take up all of your time. The team will spend less time advancing your
career. You want to be skilled in the things that engineers simply cannot do
(because they’re too smart). What if an engineer hears someone talking
bullshit? They might actually call them on it! Or playing the political game?
No engineer will put up with that crap. Their loss, your GAIN!

### 16\. Fan The Flames Of Dysfunction

The need for product management has a linear relationship with organizational
dysfunction. As dysfunction increases, so too does the need for PMs. The
greater the lack of focus, the more PMs you need. The more people distracting
the product, and trying to do a million things at once … YUP!, the more PMs
you need. You want a sea of competing priorities because only PMs can stir
this unctuous soup.

### 17\. Our Values Rock!

Tout organizational values that are extremely powerful and engaging. It’s
great for hiring. And then transgress those values repeatedly. Play up the
dichotomy. You might lose some folks in the process — even some of your best
people (the 5–10% who really care about the mushy stuff) — but what you’ll be
left with is a bunch of people who aren’t too bothered by the sappy stuff
and/or can’t afford to hit the road. That’s perfect. By exploding their bubble
of optimism and altruism you’ll be able to get down to business. We need to
ship ****ing product.

### 18\. Best Foot Forward

Structure your product team such that no one really feels empowered. They’re
taking orders from the top anyway. This wears the engineers out and flushes
any desire for direct impact. Alas, they’re just too distint from the center
of decision making. Which in turn frees you up for world domination. Hire
compliant PMs as well. You don’t want anyone going rogue and empowering their
team as that will set a bad example for the rest of the organization.

### 19\. Just Because…

Nothing puts an engineer in their place better than saying something vague
like “it’s complicated”, or “it is a juggling act”, or “it was a tradeoff”.
Even better is the phrase “just because”. That’s a great one. It really
hammers home that there is this strange alternate reality where the best ideas
don’t win, political clout is valued over intelligence and skills, and there
is no proof in the pudding. Never mind that engineers make cost/benefit
decisions every ten minutes. That’s too concrete for this discussion.

### 20\. Master Of Meetings

It is very important to arrive at all team meetings five minutes late, and
then to appear distracted, typing on your computer, answering emails, and
partially listening to the team. UNTIL it comes time for estimates at which
point you jump into action and pay rapt attention. Then run off very quickly
because you’ve got another meeting. This is a surefire way to make sure no one
wants any part of this PM business. They’ll leave that crap to you!

Another tactic is to always be running off to meetings where you’re going to
decide the future of the team. Without them being there. Works every time.

Schedule meetings during your team’s most productive time. Overwhelm the team
with meetings. Eventually someone like the CTO is going to say “we can’t have
so many meetings”. Leaders will go off and espouse efficient meetings. How is
this a benefit?

Firstly, you will not waste as much time with your team in meetings. They’ll
build faster. You can spend more meetings advancing your career, and making
plans without the team. People become so sick of meetings, that they’ll
associate collaboration with meetings. YES! Success. We want them to hate
meetings, put on their headphones, and work on what I tell them to work on.

### 21\. A Big Batch Of Ship-ass

Remember, from a PM’s perspective you don’t really win from the little things.
You win from the BIG things. Like Texas Big. You want to have a lot of fanfare
around your releases. Don’t try these little itty/bitty improvements. No …
take on big batches of work. It’s less work for you (less releases to manage).
When things go sideways you can always blame the team, and then take credit
for whipping things back into shape.

### 22\. Scrum. Meet The Intern

Scrum is great because Scrum will make sure you need a whole lot of junior
product “owners” if you plan to scale. You have all these teams and every team
NEEDS a PO. By doing this you set low expectations. It’s not like you were
planning to mentor them before throwing them to the wolves. Were you? Most
definitely not, otherwise you would have given them two teams. Wait. You did.
Any way … Your senior developers will suddenly look over and see someone a
decade younger pinning stickies to the wall. It works like a charm. Even the
crustiest hackers will crumble at this point. Doggedly they’ll announce “Just
show me what you want to get built, and I’ll build it!” BINGO! We’re shipping
****ing product.

### 23\. The Mystical Backlog / Roadmap

Be very mysterious about the product backlog. People shouldn’t be able to find
it, and you should always say things like “we don’t like to plan more than a
couple weeks out”. We all know you can’t trust adults to look at a list of
things and understand that they might change. Change that backlog and you’ll
have some seriously sad adults on your hands, who likely joined the company
for its reputation for incredibly boring and predictable work.

This also goes for the product roadmap. “Roadmap” is a funny word. Suddenly
the product team is a bunch of cartographers? Don’t be fooled, the “roadmap”
is basically an artifact of yearly planning cycles. Someone “upstairs” has
asked for a sense of what is going to get built. If you’re in the real world
your industry is changing monthly, not annually. With some tactical wins here
you’ll leave the team apathetic about anything that looks like a giant
swimlane gantt chart. Perfect. The long view encourages long-term thinking. We
hate that.

### Conclusion

And there you have it. Your PM training in one blog post. Repeat after me …

I can ship ****ing product

I can ship ****ing product

I can ship ****ing product

We can take our nebulous, difficult to define, context-specific profession
back. One set of dashed expectations at a time.

(P.S. … hopefully the satire was apparent :)


# 12 Core Competencies For Product Managers

Learn. Practice. Learn.

### 12 Core Competencies For Product Managers

#### Learn. Practice. Learn.

A college student asked me recently about product management and Product
Management “skills”. I thought for a bit and sent her this list. The key here
is that these skills can be learned and practiced. It isn’t magic. Other
things must be learned the hard way.

I haven’t listed things like Agile, scrum, roadmaps, backlogs, user-story
writing, etc. You can read a couple books and get the gist. Learning “Agile”
in one organization might not help you in your next job. Learning to
communicate clearly or facilitate a meeting effectively will serve you for
your whole career (in product management, or otherwise).

And with that, a list of 12 core competencies for Product Managers:

  1. Conduct [effective customer/user interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXXGvHafy0Y)
  2. Build [revenue](https://www.marsdd.com/mars-library/product-management-from-strategy-to-marketing-to-creating-a-business-model/), [pricing](http://pragmaticmarketing.com/resources/product-and-pricing-strategies), and adoption models. Micro/macroeconomics

  4. Effective meeting [design and facilitation](http://hrweb.mit.edu/learning-development/learning-topics/meetings/articles/basics)
  5. Mapping and understanding complex competitive, partner, and customer ecosystems. [Complexity and systems thinking](http://www.resilience.org/stories/2014-06-18/systems-thinking-and-complexity-101). Domain research
  6. Basic [data modeling](http://www.agiledata.org/essays/dataModeling101.html), [JSON](http://www.w3schools.com/json/), XML, working knowledge of [relational and non-relational databases](http://www.jamesserra.com/archive/2015/08/relational-databases-vs-non-relational-databases/). [SQL](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/), [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) APIs, [processing data using Python](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-data-intro/), etc.
  7. Experience with various analytics tools, and business intelligence tools. Know what you’re looking for, and where to find it.
  8. Broad understanding of usability, usability testing, [usability heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). Ability to communicate to the user experience team using a [common language](https://pidoco.com/en/help/ux)

# What Startup Sales Can Learn From UX

Startups, Sales, UX, and building a repeatable growth engine

* * *

### _What Startup Sales Can Learn From UX_

#### Startups, Sales, UX, and building a repeatable growth engine

As consumers and product users, we are perpetually purchasing “things” that
end up going unused. We blame ourselves for misunderstanding our own needs and
motivations, the product for not “working”, the salesperson for coercing us,
and the flashy (but misleading) ad. For whatever reason, things don’t work
out. Boxsets go unwatched, bikes go unridden, [high-tech car features go
untouched](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/survey-shows-many-high-
tech-car-features-go-unused), and personal finance software gathers virtual
dust.

This extends to much of the software we [use in our day-to-day
work](http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2013/11/applying-8020-rule-in-
software.html).

For some hot domains in the B2B SaaS software world — collaboration,
analytics, big-data, CRM, and marketing automation — the root problem is not a
tool problem. Tools, and countless variations, exist by the boatload. Rather,
the problem exists in our organizational cultures, structures, and roles, our
data-literacy, our ability to adapt to new ways of working, and our _innate
individuality_ when it comes to interacting with products in general. It’s
tough to be one-size-fits-all.

These are meaty problems that transcend domain. They [attract a lot of
entrepreneurial and investment
attention](https://index.co/top/market/saas/investments/2016), despite the
competitive landscape and low odds of success. Even when you understand those
root barriers to adoption (culture, skills, literacy), forging a repeatable
business model can be challenging. But most don’t get that far …

Beyond dealing with the competition, startups routinely drift into confusion
and cognitive bias. Founders confuse their own early sales efforts — selling
on vision and big picture — [with the day-to-day work of their
reps](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/10/12/startup-sales-why-hiring-
seasoned-reps-may-not-work/). We equate growth with demand and a large
available market. And assume our product “fits” because someone presses
Purchase Now or cuts a check.

Popular methodologies (e.g. Lean Startup) promote experimentation. But there’s
a big difference between testing with a squirt gun and a firehose. Lean
Startup stresses [structured and focused
experiments](http://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_promise_of_lean_experimentation),
but this rigor is often overlooked when the rubber hits the road and the team
fires up [Marketo](https://www.marketo.com/) and
[Salesforce](http://www.salesforce.com/).

Testing with a firehose can yield results (think growth and sales) but not the
learnings required to sustain that growth before running out of money or
imploding. This extends to being “customer-obsessed”.

We confuse our ability to sell to and support our customers with our ability
to repeatedly make someone happy with our product. Heroic efforts feel great,
but it is [damn difficult to make them repeatedly
great](https://hbr.org/2012/02/the-end-of-customer-service-he). It translates
to customer education — “our customers would absolutely fall in love with our
product if they knew how to use it”. And most nefariously to how we iterate on
and build our product — “if our customers pay us, then their requests are
valuable”.

The common theme here is a misunderstanding (either through lack of
experience, or founder goggles) of something user experience professionals
deal with every day. [No one person or company thinks, works, and adopts
software the same way](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3013474/).
Personas are far more rich and varied than we would like to believe. Product
complexity increases exponentially as the number of personas/goals/situations
increase. To solve someone’s problem, and validate that you’ve solved it, you
need to get [specific](http://www.instigatorblog.com/good-
hypotheses/2011/05/05/).

This is something that most of us understand intuitively — “no one person is
the same” — but its impact on product design and sales service design (sales
is a “service” if you think about it) is routinely underestimated. It’s the
opportunist in all of us. We’d like to believe that there is a homogenous
groundswell of interest in our product. So we turn on the sales firehose.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*sie8DhRoJZulViTzUsXmBA.png)

Sales and UX have a lot in common. Both deal with psychology every day — sales
to [close the deal](http://www.businessinsider.com/daniel-pink-to-sell-is-
human-2013-1), and [UX to design the experience](https://uxmag.com/articles
/the-psychologists-view-of-ux-design). Sales understands that certain pains
are ubiquitous, and routinely exploits that to close a deal and connect that
to the story of your product. It’s necessary to try novel things and be
scrappy. New stories, incentives, and nudges move the needle in the short-
term. What we say we need, and what we actually need are two different things.
Sales and UX gets all of this.

Like users, sales teams optimize around what is “easiest” to sell, which may
not correlate with what is easiest to support, retain, and grow. Internally,
incentives reign supreme and — as any UX pro knows — it is difficult to
reroute the sales freight train once it is up to full speed. Once a sales team
gets moving it takes on a life of its own. Without [a
strategy](https://hbr.org/2015/12/dont-turn-your-sales-team-loose-
without-a-strategy), things can go a little haywire. Part and parcel to that
strategy is having a sense of the “who”.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*juOfh1pFqOVmICjLKHxkWg.png)

UX knows it is very difficult to design a product or service that pleases all
people, in all situations. People may look similar, and their pains may, in
fact, be similar, but their product needs are not similar. Sales sells to
common pains. UX designs for specific groupings of people and their pains.
When UX thinks about personas they consider (among other things) technical
savvy, experience with similar tools, experience in the domain,
psychographics, barriers to adoption, relationships, demographics, behavioral
traits, and organizational culture. Importantly, they design for a limited
“fingerprint” across these various
[dimensions](http://www.servicedesigntoolkit.org/assets2013/posters/EN/P3-persona%20dimensions-A1.pdf).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*7Cv8zQGubobRAua4cpdxEQ.png)

<http://www.elezea.com/2013/09/case-study-vumi-go-redesign/>

For example, there is a big difference between someone who knows how to solve
the problem (with the right tool) and someone who aspirationally seeks a
solution. Both will buy the product and respond to pain selling. Building a
product for both requires different strategies. John, an executive in a low
growth industry working inside a stiff organizational culture will behave
differently from Mary, an exec working inside a nimble, tech-forward
organization in a high-growth sector. Both may be aware of the problem to
solve. They agree on that. But John’s work will need to withstand
organizational blockers, while Mary has to be scrappy and get the data she
needs to secure next year’s budget.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*jYvKGLHWArEF46xdeajYrQ.png)

<http://www.bryaneisenberg.com/personas-magic-behind-mirror/>

Increasing sales does not mean you have a [repeatable sales
process](https://salesandmarketing.com/content/sales-playbooks-key-repeatable-
sales-process), or a repeatable path to growth. It doesn’t prove your product
actually delivers specific value. Proving this requires more rigor. You are
validating a “designed” sales process:

  * A specific user persona, buyer personas, and organizational persona
  * Your ability to locate, attract, and communicate with all three in a repeatable fashion
  * Understand the [varied needs of a specific set of users](https://articles.uie.com/multiple_personalities/)
  * [Structured and consistent messaging and marketing ](http://startupmanagement.org/2014/10/14/messaging-positioning-branding-for-startups-what-happens-after-productmarket-fit/)… a singular brand message
  * Similar touch points along the customer journey
  * A match with the product as it exists today. Not an imaginary future version of the product
  * Acquisition and retention costs (including ad-hoc feature development costs) … focusing on ongoing expectations. A startup can rapidly meet new customer requests. Will the customer be as enthusiastic as that growth slows?

The key here is specificity. Selling to everyone may make your quota, but it
diminishes learning.

UX deals with this often. When we research and design, we focus on specific
personas (or small set of personas). When we test our designs, we focus on
people AND situations that match those personas. We iterate on that
understanding constantly. And then we apply those learnings and patterns
elsewhere in the product. Through a variety of methods, UX Research seeks to
answer three questions — [what do people want, what do people need, and can
people use it](https://speakerdeck.com/tsharon/validating-assumptions-with-12
-ux-research-methods) — — through the lense of a specific person and situation

What are some specific examples?

Nothing new here, but UX (and marketing) develops AND validates [rich
personas](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/persona-s-non-grata-5587cb46409c).
Are these people who we think they are? Does their behavior match who we think
they are? We consider [psychographics, demographics, goals, motivations,
roadblocks, domain-specific characteristics, current
roadblocks](http://www.contentharmony.com/blog/bootstrapped-customer-persona-
validation/), etc. This is commonplace for big companies, but during the
startup phase we are constantly drilling down, iterating, and validating our
“persona hypothesis”. This is almost impossible if you’re taking a broad
approach. Sure, your sales and growth might be higher, but you’re not
learning.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*yEolUvVRg8rQiKokLUQq5Q.png)

<http://www.garymagnone.com/blog/content-marketing-digital-touchpoints/>

This attention extends to the customer journey. How does the customer interact
with your company from first impressions — the ad online or mention at a
conference — to their first renewal as a happy company. UXers attempt to
understand these types of problems using [customer journey
maps](http://www.servicedesigntools.org/tools/8) and then by validating these
against actual customer behavior. Again, the more of these you now support,
the more assumptions you have in “inventory”. Sheer luck and persistence can
grow the business, but learning which journey actually produces that happy
renewal is paramount.

Finally, UX is constantly testing prototypes. We design low-cost experiments
(designs), test, and iterate. Before doubling down, we make sure the design is
going to work. This extends to pushing product live and measuring how people
actually use the product. Modern startup buzz-wordists have coined the term
[growth hacker,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking) and on many
levels UX and growth-hacking are remarkably similar: with common traits of
creativity, experimentation, prototyping, empathy, data and analysis.

I’m persuaded that the real value of freemium and self-serve free-trial models
is that they create a framework within which it is difficult to bias the
results. The models limit touch points and user journeys. We validate our
positioning, adoption, and renewal in a repeatable way that can be easily
adapted. Perhaps that’s the true value … freemium and self-service free trials
may not be “better” than more high touch sales, but they certainly have the
potential to be a lot less biased.

In closing …

  * View sales as a [service design concep](http://www.servicedesigntools.org/)t, and embrace those methods accordingly. On principle, you’ll start with specific personas which is the real message here. You’ll learn to understand the customer journey across your product — from first touch to renewal.
  * Choose learning over growth. [Learning starts with specific tests, not a firehose](http://steveblank.com/2015/05/06/build-measure-learn-throw-things-against-the-wall-and-see-if-they-work/). Learning transcends departments in your growing startup. Set learning goals, not sales goals. The sales model validation process cannot be run independently of product or retention experiments.
  * Embrace the value of the [lean canvas](https://leanstack.com/lean-canvas/) in all of its complexity. Don’t skimp on the market segmentation, cost model, and channel hypotheses. Testing more than one or two things at once is virtually impossible.
  * Attract a sales team that is open to iterating, learning, and rolling with changes in approach. Your best bet may be less experienced, but more flexible team members.

### Decision Making Transparency (The Why)

> In the swirl of growth, it’s easy to confuse and conflate transparency on
the decision making process, with transparency on actual decisions and
details.

> The Why is scalable because it carries the original intent of our decision,
and not just the tactic.

Even in [radically transparent
environments](https://www.sequoiacap.com/grove/posts/bzgw/radical-
transparency) it can be difficult to consume all of the information peripheral
to your day to day work. There is simply not enough time in the day. And the
multi-tasking would kill you.

And then you have the information that is deemed too sensitive or distracting
to share. Where to draw the line is outside the scope of this post, but
suffice to say there are always pieces of information that are too sensitive
or risky to share broadly.

The reality is that our work lives are largely influenced by external factors.
Decisions driving team changes, promotions, strategic shifts, project choices,
and tool choices can have a dramatic impact on the lives of the various
stakeholders. In an ideal setting these decisions would all be “local”, but
that is rarely the case.

In the swirl of growth, it’s easy to confuse and conflate transparency on the
decision making process, with transparency on actual decisions and details.
The former is powerful and engaging. The latter is so frequent that it’s
impossible to keep up. But it is easy to conflate the two and assume that both
are impossible.

It’s not impossible. Communicating the decision framework starts with some
fundamental questions …

  * Who makes the decision? Who is impacted?
  * How is the decision currently made (factors, timing, process, etc.) ?
  * What are we attempting to maximize and minimize with our decision?
  * What is our path for continuous improvement with this decision making process?

The last two points are critical. We typically frame important decisions based
on hierarchy … with the “decider” holding the power (and responsibility), and
those impacted playing a receiving role. It is unidirectional.

Consider a different perspective …

Answering these questions takes work. But it scales remarkably well.

Those impacted by decisions are often the best to determine whether those
decisions were effective. Did we realize the desired effect? How can the
decision making process be improved in the future? This is the “Why” that
people most crave. The Why is scalable because it carries the original intent
of our decision, and not just the tactic.

When people advocate for transparency, what they typically care about is not
knowing every detail. We quickly realize that’s impossible. But rather they
care about understanding how and why the decisions are made, and how and why
they can participate in iterating on the actual solution.

We trust others to make decisions. And they trust us to make decisions.

And then we enter into a partnership to continuously improve on those
decisions.

It’s the combination — trust and collaboration — that turns the typical
hierarchal decision making model into a partnership. And that lets information
sharing scale.


# Time Management: Tips for Product Managers

### Time Management: Tips for Product Managers

Time management can make or break your career as a product manager. You are
never “done”. There’s always more to do than you can possibly fit into a 60hr
week. And the cult of the rockstar PM only exacerbates the situation.
Organizations are hesitant to split the role for fear of incurring
coordination costs or losing that single “wringable neck”. It’s a recipe for
burnout, and a big reason why people do their time in the PM ranks and then
leave for greener pastures.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*fDxI8bjXm9lfrJuP.)

<https://theconsultantlounge.com/2015/09/avoid-burnout-in-consulting/>

### Say No (Nicely)

It is very easy to get drawn into every single discussion, every single
decision, and every single detail. PMs exist smack dab in the cracks of the
organization. You** become** the information conduit, which is a blessing for
your short term career, but a curse in disguise. No mortal can tie up all the
loose ends, and you eventually end up pissing people off. So you’ll have to
learn how to say **No** to meetings, calls, and continuous shoulder taps
without being a jerk. Part of this is a mindset shift. Less savvy product
managers tend to relish playing the information filter. But that simply
doesn’t scale.

### Shorter Recurring Meetings

Most meetings run too long. Ad hoc meetings lack focus, and rarely need to
happen right away (and if they do, it’s usually a sign your organization lacks
the ability to prioritize.).

Your best bet is to timebox a handful of recurring meetings (weekly, bi-
weekly, perhaps) to deal with more “transactional” communication. A well run
20 minute meeting can trump a poorly run 2hr meeting. Use constraints to force
focus. Instead of answering every single request from Sales adhoc, just
schedule a 30m optional weekly touch base and Q&amp;A. They’ll thank you
eventually. This will leave more time for the open-ended / divergent
brainstorming meetings that yield great breakthroughs and a happier team.

### Organize Information (Quickly)

PMs spent an inordinate amount of time organizing and disseminating
information. Most associate product managers get squashed under the load.
Customer calls go undocumented, requests get lost, and meeting notes disappear
into the ether — which in turn leaves people wondering what you do all day. If
you fail in the central task of providing context to teams, you are
essentially useless.

The trick here is to leverage all available tools. Find a good transcription
service (I use [rev.com](https://www.rev.com/)). Record meetings. Use a tool
like Evernote which features OCR, full-text search, tagging, integrations, and
a solid API ([see this great video by Aaron Walter on “Connected
UX”](https://vimeo.com/89520398)). Put together an [information
radiator](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/information-radiator.html) on a
whiteboard. Most importantly, be disciplined and constantly iterate on how you
provide context to your team. If no one is paying attention, find a better
way.

### Work Less and Time-Block

Product managers frequently operate under continuous stress, continuous sleep
deprivation, and continuous work fatigue. This makes it difficult to be at the
top of your game. Somehow you always seem to let tasks fill the available
hours in the day. To combat this I suggest time-blocking (see the [Pomodoro
Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/)) and calling a “hard stop” at a
reasonable time each day. Look back on the last month of your work. Was all of
that work really necessary? What work benefited the team?

### High Leverage

What are your highest leverage activities as a product manager? Some examples:

  * Passing new data and context to your team is high leverage
  * Figuring out how to be optional and dispensable — not being the blocker
  * Being available to your team when they have questions
  * Sensing patterns, drawing together disparate sources of information
  * Untangling what stakeholders (including customers) say they want vs.what they really need

These are the things you should focus on. Going to a meeting where nothing
gets done every week is not high leverage. High leverage work doesn’t
necessarily need to be glamorous. A quick set of meeting notes summarizing a
brainstorming session can move mountains. So be honest with yourself about
what work actually moves the needle.

One of the highest leverage things you can do as a product manager is to
figure out a way to build less, but still drive value for your customers. That
takes time and it takes testing. It also takes a fair amount of relaxation and
creativity on your part (see above). But the rewards are great. You can save
the team weeks and weeks of work. And any time you can get some piece of
software out there into the hands of customers earlier rather later is a huge
deal. The highest leverage work gets straight to the crux of the problem …
making valuable software.

### Eat Lunch…

  * Eat lunch!
  * Use lunches for creative brainstorming with coworkers. Get outside. A change of scenery can often spark great ideas
  * Take breaks and exercise. You’ll be more effective when you are “on”
  * Know when you are at your best. Use that time for your highest leverage work.

Check out this classic HBR article: [Manage Your Energy Not Your
Time](https://hbr.org/2007/10/manage-your-energy-not-your-time)

### **In Closing**

None of this is rocket-science. But as PMs we frequently get caught up in the
day-to-day. Our work starts to feel 100% reactive. We lose, of course, but so
does our team. Worst of all, it begins to promulgate the PM stereotype:
overworked, narcissistic, controlling, untrusting, and fickle.

The goal isn’t to work 80hrs, but to discover those things that make everyone
— and especially your team — more effective. Then, everyone wins — you, your
team, your customer, and your business..


# Your Startup: Food Truck or Buffet?

Is your startup a Food Truck or a Buffet?

* * *

### Your Startup: Food Truck or Buffet?

Is your startup a Food Truck or a Buffet?

### Food Trucks

Food trucks live and die by trying to do one thing well, and they’re
relatively cheap to bootstrap ([$70,000 —
$80,000](http://www.forbes.com/sites/investopedia/2012/09/27/the-cost-of-
starting-a-food-truck/#440fea602930)). If your clientele dries up — the local
venture funded startup goes caput, for example — you can drive somewhere else.
It’s just you, your partner, your food, and your customers.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*1mV9tajvoGXrqxH1.)

<http://www.post-gazette.com/life/dining/2015/07/26/Food-trucks-have-nowhere-
to-go-but-up/stories/201507260052>

Food trucks let restaurateurs be creative and nimble. Writes Josh Ozersky in
[Why Food Trucks Aren’t Going Away](http://ideas.time.com/2012/06/13/food-
trucks-are-here-to-stay/):

> You see, it’s not just diners who have become more fickle, more demanding,
more impatient with the conventions of traditional restaurant food. It’s the
chefs too, who want to be flexible, to try out crazy mash-ups, stunts, and
culinary in-jokes

Of course food trucks [have their fair share of challenges](http://mobile-
cuisine.com/business/why-do-food-truck-businesses-fail/) like licensing,
undercapitalization, being myopic about your vision, the gold-rush mentality
(sound familiar, startups), and lack of identity. And they can fail like any
other business. [This article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/22/food-
truck-failures_n_2499463.html) cites failure rates around 30–35%.

### Buffets

People go to buffets to absolutely stuff their face. It’s [a
sport.](http://midtownlunch.com/2007/03/07/the-ml-guide-to-all-you-can-eat-
chinese-food-buffets/) It’s commodity eating. It’s almost sacrilegious (this
Saudi cleric went as far as to issue [a fatwa against all you can eat
buffets](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/15/buffet-ban-fatwa-saudi-
cleric_n_4971190.html)). The only thing “unique” about a particular buffet is
its sheer enormity and the spectacle.

[Good buffets aren’t cheap](http://casinofabs.com/Controlling-Buffet-
Costs.htm), with food costs in the 50–60% range and back of house costs much
higher than traditional restaurants. You can’t start a buffet in a van. You
need a cavernous kitchen, storage, ice for those massive bland Alaskan crab
legs, big pots, and lots of labor. And that’s why most buffets feature mostly
gut-filling, mediocre food.

Buffets are also [a food safety
nightmare](http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2010/07/buffets-and-cross-
contamination/#.VuZCBZMrKCQ) … even with the sneeze guards. Your Golden Corral
chili [might have a rat head](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national
/florida-man-claims-golden-corral-chili-rat-head-article-1.1981988) swimming
around in there if you aren’t careful (test first). It’s hard to keep track of
all that food, rotate it, heat and cool it, and throw it out when it festers.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*dbjrQsKORYkVPosj.)

### How About Your Startup?

Are you trying to be all things to all people, and suffer from quality issues?
Do large swaths of your product go uneaten? Can you pivot and change direction
easily? Is focus fleeting? Were you lured into the idea of offering a
“platform”, but turned around to find that the broad offering was more of a
collection of commodity-grade features?

If so, it might already be too late. Put on the brakes now. Figure out how you
can stay food-truck-like for longer. Iterate on your product, and then take
the step up to a “real” restaurant.


# How Much Does A New Feature Cost?

More Than You Think …

* * *

### How Much Does A New Feature Cost?

#### More Than You Think …

One of the fundamental challenges of product development is understanding the
true cost of releasing a new feature. The benefits feel concrete. Shipping
feels great. Talking costs is a downer.

Consider …

  1. Opportunity costs across all disciplines
  2. Cost to implement feature (engineering, UX, product)
  3. Cost to implement incremental improvements (engineering, UX, product)
  4. Cost to deliver feature (processing, storage, monitoring)
  5. Cost to train people internally to sell the feature
  6. Cost to train people internally to support the feature
  7. Cost to market the feature to existing customers
  8. Cost to market the feature to new customers
  9. Coordination costs across all teams
  10. Cost to document and train users/customers on new feature
  11. Cost to maintain that extra documentation
  12. Cost to train engineers on more complex codebase
  13. Cost of slower engineering, caused by increased system complexity and maintenance
  14. Cost to hire more resources to account for slower engineering
  15. Cost of reduced flexibility, caused by increased system complexity and maintenance
  16. Cost of maintaining system usability as system broadens
  17. … until the feature reaches end-of-life (unless you retire it)

It turns out that engineering costs are but a small part of the puzzle.

Wow. So I guess it isn’t just a week or two of work! The good news is that you
don’t need to cut a check for these things right away. The hard news is that
you’ll end up paying in the long run. And many features end up going unused
(or rarely used).

So … consider this expanded list of costs the next time you think about
tacking on a new feature. Is it still worth it?

### Stop Setting Up Product Roadmaps To Fail

### Why Read

Stop debating whether you are doing product roadmaps “right”, or whether
roadmaps are evil. Look instead at the job you are hiring your roadmap to
achieve. And then ask if the roadmap is the best tool for the job.

### TOC

  * 14 common product roadmap problems

New to Product Management? What is a product roadmap? For a standard

* * *

### A Litany Of Roadmap Ills

Roadmaps are frequently abused. To save you thirty minutes, I’ve organized
these observed problems into the list below.

Some of these problems are inherent to the process — you need to actively work
to prevent them from happening. Others are caused by user error or deep
organizational dysfunction. And some are governed by even broader effects like
the planning fallacy, confirmation bias, and groupthink.

**Roadmaps encourage people to…**

  1. [Horse trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trading) initiatives, placate stakeholders vs. focusing on value creation
  2. Stick to the plan when the plan is no longer optimal
  3. Chase harmfully high utilization rates (the jigsaw illusion)
  4. [Future sell](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/694-you-dont-need-a-product-road-map), instead of relying on the current merits of product
  5. [Prioritize new feature development](https://blog.intercom.io/where-do-you-suck-where-does-it-matter/) (items which can be easily understood and sold) over equally promising enhancements to the existing product
  6. Converage prematurely on solutions
  7. Rely on estimates, despite the fallibility of those estimates

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*lOyg3v-GPArdMfHFP558mA.png)

“Big Batch” Planning

**Roadmaps …**

  1. Encourage the illusion that efforts are linked to a timeline(when most aren’t)
  2. Obscure underlying assumptions, rationale, and vision. Even when described (e.g. a theme), it is still difficult to parse why the theme matters
  3. Institutionalize “big batch” yearly planning, which in turn decreases agility
  4. Encourage group think — [satisficing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing) — over focus. Initiatives lose their bite
  5. Fail to address the needs of all “users” (e.g. your roadmap is fine for communicating with executives, but fails to meet the needs of your front-line teams)
  6. Discourage experimentation and acting on new insights / data
  7. Create dependencies across the organization (decreases agility

### Challengers vs. Defenders

OK. That’s a pretty hairy list. I’m not the first to challenge roadmaps.
Luckily this stuff is out there in the google-verse by the boatload. You will
also find debates that look something like this:

**Challenger  
**[Methodology] is flawed

**Defender  
**You’re just not doing it right. The real value is in [Some Positive Aspect]. Yes, some people abuse these things. Just not me …  
You need to get back to the basics …  
You need to stop doing it the old way …

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*eXUqdtEc2SMBg2H5xxCg4Q.png)

**Challenger  
**What could you do such that [Some positive aspect] would be possible without the abuse, and observable negative effects?

**Defender  
**This is heresy. Here in the real world we need [Methodology] because [Some Reason]. And plenty of great teams — you know [Company] — use them also. So you’re on crack!

**Challenger  
**What is to say that [Company] isn’t successful in spite of [Methodology] ?

**Defender  
**Damn you. I’m blocking you on Twitter.

Check out this overview of one of the classic Twitter debates (from a somewhat
similar question … #noestimates)

### If Things Were Awesome

To be clear, I advocate for thinking in terms of initiatives, problems to
solve, and missions. And that’s nothing new or groundbreaking. I use mind maps
like this:

This advice is mirrored by most of the roadmapping software vendors like
[ProductPlan](http://www.productplan.com/) and
[Aha](http://www.aha.io/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=brand_search&gclid
=CJKj-bHg88sCFYMehgodOFoMzw), as well as folks like [Melissa
Perri](https://medium.com/u/d5387b79efe8), [Roman
Pichler](https://medium.com/u/9562e5263e32), etc. All caution against using
the roadmap as a glorified feature gantt chart.

The other day, [Woody
Zuill](https://twitter.com/WoodyZuill?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)
asked me something to the effect of:

> what would need to happen such that this wasn’t even an issue. What would it
take for the company to be awesome?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*hPu3Zi5A1i1Ngos-.)

Let’s try that thought experiment …

What would a crazy successful and awesome product development team actually
look like? Would they still have gant-like visuals for their roadmap?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*MJyRcuIpGEG5pxgB.)

Probably not. The future might look nothing like a 12 lane LA highway. Because
you’d be on a bullet train.

### Needs &amp; Being Awesome

Continuing on that thought …

  * You’ve hired the roadmap because you have a **Need**
  * If things were **Awesome**, what would things look like?

**Need:** “The process helps us have the right conversations”  
**Awesome:** “We have the right conversations without needing a prop. It is [easy to get real](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UQYKVE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1), and discuss priorities without solutioning. We leverage the right decision making and focusing tools for the job, without bad side-effects.”

**Need:** “I need to know if you’re working on my favorite feature, or plan to”  
**Awesome:** “The product development team continuously surprises and delivers value. So much so that pet features become far less important. We maintain a low planning-inventory. All team members are encouraged to submit ideas to solve our most important challenges.”

**Need:** “We have to meet to decide which features are most important, to advocate for our ideas, and favorite features”  
**Awesome:** “The problem to solve is known, and all team members — down to the developers, UX, etc. — are empowered to solve them and try to push the needle without drowning in meetings. And we make continuous progress towards those goals. Everyone trusts each other. When we fail, that’s OK as well … provided we learn, and do better next time.”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*PgeB1tI_4pjT0T23wFF-Hw.png)

**Need:** “We need to have a yearly plan, and the roadmap is part of that”  
**Awesome:** “You always have focus, vision, and direction … not just in late December (or whenever your yearly planning period is). Gaining that shared understanding is a rapid process, and can happen at any appropriate time. Few dependencies hamper the team. We respond immediately to new opportunities, and data.”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*f0IF-fzFXv4G8r_iz9lGsw.png)

**Need:** “We need to know what is coming down the pike!”  
**Awesome:** “The product is sellable, awesome, and valuable as is. You’d be able to sell to those people without pitching shaky future promises. You’d discuss features released in the last two months, and the prospect would be wowed. From a technology standpoint we can flexibly tackle new challenges without a ton of notice.”

**Need: **“We need to see the big picture, where are we going, and how our work fits into that”  
**Awesome:** “The evidence of impact is everywhere: in customer feedback, in the data, and in the dollars and cents. Teams link their work directly to a compelling vision (the big picture). Most importantly, the current work is impactful, so there is no need to future sell internally.”

Note: If you listen carefully, most “big picture” discussions are actually a
code for “we don’t think we’re making a difference”.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*2votZLbfcMxlPYKP.)

<http://www.boost.co.nz/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Release-Planning-PSI-
Program-Plan.png>

**Need**: “We need to coordinate with marketing, training, and support”  
**Awesome:** “A steady stream of awesome. Short lead times are acceptable to partners, and the batches are small enough to handle gracefully. Teams iterate on features until they “hit the mark” and then marketing uses that actual data (and case studies and momentum) to market. Training and support coexist with the development teams instead of “tossing it over the wall”.”

**Need:** “The board keeps asking us for our roadmap”  
**Awesome:** “The board knows what goals you are shooting for, and your progress towards those goals. Quarterly meetings involve real news, and real data, along with the sweeping vision (“we aim to take that hill, and that hill”). You’d exceed your goals, so no extra icing is necessary.”

* * *

No, no, no you’ll say. We need roadmaps to address these needs! But consider a
time when your team was just flowing, building awesome stuff, making customers
happy … was it because of your roadmap?

### Conclusion

Roadmaps aren’t the problem, obviously. We pick our tools and methods. My goal
with this post was to encourage you to challenge the “why”: why use roadmaps,
why use roadmaps the way we typically use roadmaps, and what it might take to
be awesome (such that this conversation is irrelevant).

Consider many of the enduring debates: estimates, roadmaps, technical debt,
iteration length, team structure, roles, Agile …

Why do we continue arguing about them? Perhaps because they — and the
methodologies we create to control them — are symptoms and medicine for those
symptoms. Dig deeper!

> _The economic problem of (an organization) is rapid adaptation to changes in
its particular circumstances. Then, the ultimate decisions must be left to the
people who are familiar with these circumstances, who know directly of the
relevant changes and of the resources available to meet them. This problem
cannot be solved by first communicating all this knowledge to a central board
which then issues its orders. But the “man on the spot” cannot decide solely
on the basis of his limited but intimate knowledge of his immediate
surroundings . There still remains the problem of communicating to him
suchfurther information as he needs to fit his decisions into the whole
pattern of changes of the larger ( organizational) system

### Opening Your Eyes to Real Customer Delight

Drawings by [Claire Bowman](https://about.me/ClairesOddities)

#### How delighted customers behave, and why measuring and learning from these
signals is likely one of the most important things you can do for your product

* * *

### Yes … Delight

Rewind to a time before, [as Kevin Roose writes in New York
Magazine](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/08/silicon-valley-whimsy-
is-trumping-usefulness.html), “the titans of tech start[ed] talking like
kindergarten teachers.” Delight meant [a high degree of
satisfaction](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/delight) … the 10 on a
1–10 custom satisfaction survey._ _Fast-forward and it has come to represent
all that is wrong with gratuitous design-for-design’s-sake, startup founder-
speak/gibberish, and hokey marketing campaigns.

Jared Spool beautifully describes the difference in[ this story about Hyatt
Hotels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewpz2gR_oJQ&feature=youtu.be&t=58) and
their “random acts of kindness” campaign:

> The problem at the time, and the reason their customer satisfaction was
going down, was that they had a lot of frustraters to combat. They were
getting a large number of complaints. Instead of addressing those problems
they decided to go for _delight_ and focus on delighting people. [They
thought] hopefully you can use _delight_ to cover the bad smell of the failing
hotel

That’s not the brand of delight I’m talking about in this post. I’d like to
resurrect the classic, more general definition … because _delighted_ means
extremely satisfied or pleased. And this post is about what customers do when
they are extremely satisfied or pleased.

Plus _delight_ is 10 characters less than _extremely satisfied_. Onward …

### The Product/Market Fitting Room

Start-ups constantly struggle with defining (and finding) [product/market
fit](http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee204/ProductMarketFit.html). They plumb
product metrics hoping to “prove” engagement and [predict
renewals](http://www.predictiveanalyticstoday.com/customer-churn-renew-upsell-
cross-sell-software-tools/). From a strict dollars-and-cents standpoint,
selling product and renewing customers is the goal. But, in most domains (and
especially B2B SaaS), neither really indicates whether the customer is truly
delighted with their purchase.

Many businesses make the mistake of assuming that a customer is loyal, simply
because they aren’t complaining and they keep coming back month after month. -  
 [Wootric](http://blog.wootric.com/what-happens-when-you-confuse-repeat-
business-with-customer-loyalty/), “What Happens When You Confuse Repeat
Business with Customer Loyalty”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*dVuCPvjKt_b8iv9ny-k59A.png)

Users with a “meh” attitude toward the product often stick around — sometimes
because they don’t have the time or energy to shop around, sometimes because
they’re too embarrassed to admit to themselves that they purchased the wrong
tool, and sometimes because someone [is forcing them to use the
software](http://chrislema.com/customers-and-users/).

### From “Meh” to “No, Thanks”

The trouble is that this customer indifference comes back to haunt you. That
captive user leaves their company and becomes a buyer elsewhere. As your
company grows, your time to sweet-talk individual customers into sticking
around is reduced.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*0sYmIpXMUDBTavSR2W7Hcw.png)

You start rationalizing by thinking that usability and delighting customers
aren’t important in your domain, and that you’ll be fine as long as the
economics look promising. Maybe you cobble together some white papers and
share the occasional success story. Or, you fetishize using customer support,
customer success, and [services](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/consulting-
organizations-vs-product-shanif-dhanani) to patch up holes in your product.
Mediocre becomes the new normal.

This all takes a toll: your team eventually becomes disengaged. The product
rots from the inside out. Turning back the clock and regaining your edge is a
daunting task. You either start and stay there, or fight an uphill battle to
find your lost (or maybe never explored) product mojo.

There is a way around this, but it requires stubbornness and bullheadedness:
Demand to see evidence of real customer delight minus the Kool-Aid.

### “Measure” and Observe Delight

I’m going to go out on a very un-data-nerd-like limb here. To truly delight
your customers and create an amazing, differentiated product (and to do so
consistently year after year), you’ll need to measure things a bit
differently. I say this as someone who spends a great deal of time worrying
about how to measure things and how to use descriptive, predictive, and
prescriptive analytics to improve my product.

I’d argue that many of the product metrics we capture (e.g. engagement,
conversions) are proxies for less tangible things like customer delight,
advocacy, and product focus. The hard metrics can be used to predict churn and
trial conversions, but they fail to cut at the central question: Is our
product truly inspiring our customers and kicking ass? And, if so, why? Are we
[In-N-Out Burger, or
McDonalds](http://blogs.wsj.com/independentstreet/2009/01/28/in-n-out-burger-
vs-mcdonalds-guess-who-won/)?

Consider an example: a not-too-impressed diner leaves a 15% tip. A drunk diner
leaves a 20% tip. A thoroughly impressed and new fan-for-life diner leaves a
20% tip. All give the restaurant four stars in their online reviews. How do
you differentiate rabid foodie fandom from “a decent meal” or a happy buzz?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*aRYzLsa4dr0UWWuaofEiZA.png)

Not-Too-Impressed, Drunk, or Fan?

You can do a sentiment analysis of the review. Factor in the tip. Record
[facial biometrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4pM7j2ejDE). Have the
server assess the diner satisfaction. Measure length of the dining experience.

It is all “data,” albeit largely qualitative. The human computer is a pretty
good pattern matcher and sensor (despite our various biases, or maybe because
of them). [We lost at Go vs. Google](http://www.wired.com/2016/01/in-a-huge-
breakthrough-googles-ai-beats-a-top-player-at-the-game-of-go/), but we are not
half-bad at detecting rampant excitement. If it was all down to a perfect
science, though, we’d consistently make great products, predict all trends,
convert all customers, and never have product fails.

### Why Measure/Look For Delight?

When we open our eyes to what customer delight looks and feels like, we get
the right signals to tune our product strategy. By _product_ here I’m talking
about the the whole package: who you target, how you make customers successful
([customer success](https://medium.com/the-growth-hackers-cookbook/customer-
success-has-a-quantifiable-impact-on-revenue-d18d25786863#.pkfvsojf0)), the
goals and outcomes your software supports, your support team, and your sales
team. From the service design perspective, every interaction you have with
customers is “the product.” The customer experience extends far beyond logging
into a tool each day.

The key is awareness and not rationalizing a tepid response. When you have
that awareness of what a happy customer truly looks like, the rest becomes
“easy” (but still damn hard). For the builders it becomes more fun and
rewarding. And that has to count for something.

### The Delighted Customer

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*PcESXNMaoVAdbL9Zi-CDig.png)

So, what do you keep your eyes open for? Take a big step back from your
dashboards, spreadsheets, and predictive algorithms and ask if your
users/customers are truly delighted. Are they obsessed with your product? Do
they self-identify with your mission? Are they your sales team, marketing
department, and product idea box all wrapped into one? And not just one
customer, or the occasional success story, but a good swath of your customers?

It is easy to pretend this stuff is happening. Or rationalize that it doesn’t
matter. But when it **_really_** happens, it’s a awesome thing. If you pay
attention, you may notice that the delighted customer…

### 1\. Really Likes You

  * Bakes the team a cake. (This is not a joke — I’ve seen it happen!)
  * Visits you when they’re in town. Invites you out for drinks.
  * Remembers your name! And the names of your team members.
  * Bugs you for T-shirts. And then sends you a photo of them wearing the T-shirt.
  * Uses emoticons when writing otherwise dry emails. Like …

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*Df9N3VV59T2oZ5tr.)

### 2\. While in the Buying Process…

  * Seeks you out prior to purchase! Is delighted by what they imagine they can do with your product. Your marketing just gets them more excited. On that first call, is bubbling with ideas and questions before you even get started.
  * Shows hints of delight right from the start. Dives into a trial and take things further than you ever expected. On some level you feel like the roles have been reversed, and they’re selling to you!
  * Already knows how you compare to the competition — they’ve done their homework.
  * Can describe the precise pain they hope to address, or goal they hope to achieve, and connect that to unique product traits.
  * Makes the internal renewal case for you and spearheads the discussion with purchasing
  * Contacts you to renew, instead of waiting for your call. Contacts you to explore purchasing add-ons, instead of waiting for your email.
  * A couple of months after purchasing, writes to thank you. Literally, as in a handwritten thank-you note.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*Tpt3kNmVtnLgJaGPdrE5tg.png)

### 3\. While Using the Product…

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*xpOiMRZQ3VsjJDD5TNze1Q.png)

  * Describes your product as “very easy to use,” ”easy to learn,” ”user-friendly.” Cliche, yes, but NPS and SUS (system usability score) [are related](http://www.measuringu.com/blog/nps-sus.php) (more on this [here](http://www.measuringu.com/usability-loyalty.php)). This you can measure quantitatively.
  * Uses your product/company name as a verb: “We ______ed it.”
  * Writes you unsolicited emails with feature/product _ideas_** (**not feature requests, or fixes for workarounds).
  * Sends you feedback on new features shortly after they are released, again, without prompting.
  * Invests money to integrate with your product. Many customers may ask for pre-built “connectors,” but the most passionate customers will find it worth it to shoulder the cost of integrating.
  * Does awesome and unexpected things with your product (things you never expected or planned for).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*WYSLJt_g_09NFxNS6TMJcA.png)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*2fDb_zKh6prl08Yekn9O9Q.png)

  * Hounds you to learn about the roadmap, not because they’re waiting on features, but rather because they want to plan their training and get the most out of new functionality.
  * Regularly seeks the help of your support team to resolve _their _challenges rather than challenges with your product. The difference is critical.

### 4\. For Things They Value…

  * Writes or calls you to describe wins and provide proof (qualitative and quantitative data).
  * Describes how your product is actually changing the way they work and explains how.
  * Credits you for making their _personal_** **job easier and more effective. Or better yet, for helping them get a raise!
  * Proposes interesting partnerships if your products share a similar domain.
  * Creates their own training material around your product — not because your help docs aren’t comprehensive, but because they’re morphing their company around your product.

### 5\. As an Advocate…

See this post [for more about the value of brand advocacy](https://medium.com
/the-growth-hackers-cookbook/customer-success-has-a-quantifiable-impact-on-
revenue-d18d25786863#.s6sz9843l).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*s2nWKWNfDt5Y1_DcDVMAEA.png)

  * Hounds you to be part of a beta group or research panel.
  * Refers you to friends and professional contacts in their industry.
  * Uses _because_ when describing why they love your product: “I love ____ because.” Your best customer advocate is someone who can explain why the product benefits them.
  * Brings you with them to their next job, or at least tries.
  * Sends you unsolicited ideas for white papers and case studies. Volunteers because they want to be associated with the product. Provides you a reference logo for your website without prompting.
  * Interact with you across all available channels (blog post comments, forums, etc.).
  * Without coercion, recommends your product on sites like Quora, Stack Overflow, etc., and includes a detailed explanation of the “why.”
  * Hounds you about having a user conference, and maybe even offers to host one.
  * Promotes your product across their organization. Suddenly you get calls from people you’ve never met and they are already sold on the product because “_______ has been singing your praises.”

### Conclusion

This is not an argument against being data-driven. Rather, it’s an argument
for widening the _information gathering net_. I speak with many product teams.
They describe the glory days of being able to talk to each customer, to fill
their backlog with valuable items, and to ship software effortlessly. But now
“things are complicated”, budgets are tighter, and there’s a pressure to show
the ROI for product development efforts. Sure, build your analytics chops. Use
whatever data — quantitative and qualitative — you can find. Predict,
prescribe, and describe.

But don’t forget what got you here in the first place: happy, engaged, and yes
_delighted _customers. Because in most cases the metrics will bring you back
there anyway. Lay off the Koolaid and start listening.

### 10 Common PM Intuition Traps

Many situations in product development run counter to our intuitions. The
nature of the work is constantly changing. Context morphs frequently. Our
teams, organizations, competitors, and industries represent a dizzyingly
complex system. What we think works, makes sense and feels efficient betrays
us.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*fOjsHl5gqack0hVGdb-hAQ.png)

The famous Katama weather rock …

Awareness helps. But so does habitually putting yourself in mildly
uncomfortable situations. The quest for consistency and repeatability is often
our Achilles’s heel and serves as a blocker to growth.

Below I’ve listed ten common intuition traps in product development. What
resonates? Disagree? Let’s have a conversation.

**1 Stop trying to keep your team “busy”**. Chasing high utilization is a recipe for catastrophic collapse. Encounter one unexpected setback, and the whole system crumbles. Instead, build in a safe level of slack to absorb the ebbs, flows, and hiccups. The snakes are invisible in knowledge work:

Watch out for the waiting snakes …

**2\. Stop managing large planning inventories**. Your goal is to invest time at the last responsible moment. What use is talking about something you’ll work on two months from now? The context will likely change, and that time spent planning will go wasted.

**3\. Stop attempting to “get ahead” of projects in small groups**, without the whole team present. It rarely has the desired effect. End what you’ve been working on, pause, breath, and then tackle the next mission together. Build shared understanding collaboratively with the team. A well-oiled team can ramp up on [a new challenge in a couple of days](http://www.gv.com/sprint/).

> [](https://twitter.com/AlexStearnCom/status/718619798775705600)

**4\. Stop believing estimates can help you plan**. It’s easy to play three-dimensional chess with your initiatives: “If A will take a long time, then it is better to do C and D!” The reasoning is sound, but it rarely pans out. Often, you’ve failed to slice out the parts of A that will be truly valuable. Or, more commonly, this suggests a deeper issue with priorities.

**5\. Stop multitasking!** Doing three things at once prevents the team from delivering value early, and rarely beats working serially.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*xsUvG_nXqd4MQzd0pygboA.png)

<http://www.slideshare.net/JelenaFiodorova/teamwork-agile-way>

**6\. Stop saying “we might as well while we’re at it.”** It is tempting to tackle less valuable work because it is convenient. If the team happens to be in that area of the code, we pile on the requests. Pause and ask what is stopping you from tackling your most valuable opportunity.

**7\. Stop finishing for the sake of finishing.** If you’ve discovered your current effort will fail to drive value — especially considering the high costs of maintaining features — then just walk away. The [sunk-cost bias](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/how-the-sunk-cost-fallacy-makes-you-act-stupid.html) is incredibly powerful.

**8\. Stop grouping work into large batches**. Yes, they feel more comfortable and efficient because batches tend to incur a transaction cost. Think instead how you can [lower the costs associated with delivering small batche](http://dev2ops.org/2012/03/devops-lessons-from-lean-small-batches-improve-flow/)s (test automation, investing in DevOps, writing release notes, feature toggles, etc.) Large epics take on a life of their own and expand to fill the available space.

**9\. Stop forcing premature alignment/convergence**. Creativity and diversity drive novelty, passion, and innovation. Pressuring the team to “be on the same page” can thwart the journey towards discovering the right page!

**10\. Stop trying to solve problems with process alone**. It is tempting to believe that you can fix things with a slightly better process, tool, structure, or report. Or that things will transpire exactly how they’ve played out in the past. That’s rarely the case. It can be difficult to predict what will work in a rapidly changing environment. The alternate is to try what Dave Snowden calls “safe to fail probes”.

> Safe-fail Probes are small-scale experiments that approach issues from
different angles, in small and safe-to-fail ways, the intent of which is to
approach issues in small, contained ways to allow emergent possibilities to
become more visible. The emphasis, then, is not on ensuring success or
avoiding failure, but in allowing ideas that are not useful to fail in small,
contained and tolerable ways. The ideas that do produce observable benefits
can then be adopted and amplified when the complex system has shown the
appropriate response to its stimulus.

This point is made hilariously clear in Snowden’s advice for planning a
children’s party …

### Product! Stop Whining About Sales!

As Product folks, we need to stop whining about Sales. We aren’t the victim.
We need to break out of the “glass case of emotion”:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*J-xVDMEDgVgYKF3HOrkrWg.png)

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fmHCNfowbQ>

It’s our fault …

It’s our responsibility to shape a product that is easy to sell, easy to use,
enables excellent outcomes for our customers, AND has a winning growth model.
If that doesn’t exist, it is perfectly reasonable to expect our team — the
broader team, including sales — to “[flow like
water](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/29138-be-like-water-making-its-way-
through-cracks-do-not)” and take the path of least resistance. If that path
doesn’t lead to the product as it exists today, then the path is broken, not
the people.

Selling to the “right” people should be 100% natural: great customer
experience resonates with the “right” people, referrals happen, case studies
materialize, personas start to dot the wall and everyone zeros in on the sweet
spot.

Selling “in the box” should be 100% natural because the box addresses a
compelling pain point, even if it’s rough around the edges. And when it comes
time to renew, the “right” product (and team, and service delivery approach)
will renew itself without roadmap promises.

When that doesn’t happen, the organization becomes imbalanced and odd
incentives percolate. Consider how you’d react in the same situation with a
quota hanging over your head. You’d lodge yourself in the biggest and
gnarliest deal you could find to [slay the
elephant](http://andymonfried.blogspot.com/2006/02/elephant-hunting-in-sales-
term.html). Or churn out sub-optimal deals. We humans are pretty darn scrappy.

It’s your job as product person to point the way and make the case. If you are
still in learning mode, then make that clear!

The product can be easy to sell, but hard to use ([Brita water
filters](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-bad-to-never-change-a-Brita-filter)). Or
insanely valuable, but difficult to get into the hands of the right customer,
and turn into a successful business ([insert 50% of cool IoT Kickstarter
projects](http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/10/the-ugly-afterlife-of-
crowdfunding-projects-that-never-ship-and-never-end/)). Step back for a moment
and consider everything your company does as The Product. Your support is The
Product. The way your salespeople interact with customers is The Product. Your
marketing is The Product. The product “works” when all aspects of the service
— yes, probably best described [as a
service](http://thisisservicedesignthinking.com/), not a widget — are in
harmony.

The challenge of getting this right was my primary motivation for [joining an
analytics company](http://www.pendo.io/) focused on product teams. Consider
the problem. Cold hard cash, or a contract, has a way of trumping murky,
disparate, and difficult to extract data. That impending deal feels real. It
feels actionable. But we all know the slippery slope that can take us down.

There’s a reason why the product team is (often) viewed as the whipping boy of
the organization. We talk a big game but rarely have the data and evidence to
back up our gut. We try to care for the big picture but have trouble painting
the big picture. Or we lead by fiat, and erode trust.

But there’s an alternative. Easy to extract, easy to present, and easy to act
on evidence trumps all. Yes, this requires a cultural shift. But that’s part
of why you signed up.

So with that, stop whining and take responsibility for your product! Discover
a lucrative sweet spot and build something that exploits that information. Use
evidence (qualitative and quantitative) to tell a compelling story. And, show
empathy to your sales team!


# The Killer Sales Instinct vs. Startup Validation

As a rickshaw driver in NYC, I had my sales routine down pat.

### The Killer Sales Instinct vs. Startup Validation

As a rickshaw driver in NYC, I had my sales routine down pat.

Midwestern Couple in Times Square … “you folks like to take a tour of
Broadway? And then Central Park?”

Business Person, Park Ave, at 5 PM … “no cabs around, can I get you to Grand
Central for $20? 5 minutes!”

Lower East Side … “um, you know, hey, you guys need a ride to the Save The
Robots.”

When I picked up Ben Stiller and Dennis Rodman one night, I knew to ride
instantly AWAY from the paparazzi. I learned this through lots of trial and
error, undercharging, and losing my voice. It took months, but I got to the
point where I could come home with a couple of hundred bucks on any day of the
week.

Manhattan Rickshaw Driver

I also learned that killer instinct. Not everyone had a great ride in the
rickshaw. But I knew how to get them to take the plunge and agree to $30 for
10 minutes of watching a scrawny kid pedal them three blocks. That felt
shitty. Especially when it was raining. But I needed to pay rent.

We are persuaded all the time to buy things we don’t need or use. Someone
wins. We lose. But with services — and I regard most software as a “service”
these days — you typically can’t succeed that way. You rely on someone coming
back. Unfortunately, so many of our methodologies are stuck in the “old” ways
of physical and shippable products … front-loaded to trigger the purchase
decision vs. the retain decision.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*Ze1YzC_R2lNRDilASZJ1aQ.png)

figure.

The job of Product Development and Marketing becomes exponentially more
challenging when you cater to different personas. It isn’t linear. Three is
way more difficult than one. Every meeting becomes more difficult. Every UX
decision becomes more difficult. Every prioritization meeting becomes more
difficult. Every support case becomes more difficult. You just slow down.
There’s no way around it, and even late nights will not stem the tide.

With marketing, it is no easier. You can’t market to Classical Music fans and
Nascar Fans at the same time, even if they both need to go on a diet. The
approach will be different. Everyone wants to lose weight (the pain sells
decently well), but Bach aficionados and Kevin Harvick junkies are a different
breed. In both cases, the miracle diet goes unreturned, despite the 30 day
refund.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*rrT066h8-v6frEUfvt8XYw.png)

**Selling to learn, and selling to sell is a fundamentally different task**. The minute that killer instinct bubbles up — that competitive drive to close the deal, that paranoia about the deal falling through, that fear of hitting the number — you’ve already lost your ability to learn about certain things. You’ll learn how to morph the message to the audience (like I did countless times as a rickshaw driver), but you won’t learn about the big picture.

Always Be Closing

> Get them to sign on the line that is dotted.

This is not a fundamentally bad thing. Some of us never learn how to turn that
drive on. It’s just a matter of timing. The time WILL come, but the time is
not now. That killer instinct is both an asset and liability.

The “learning” that needs to happen is: can you target someone with marketing,
pitch them, close them, get them to use your product, and make them insanely
happy as a customer? And do that repeatedly without insane heroism, and a
limited resource (like a psyched founder)? It’s something the [growth hacker
](https://growthhackers.com/)movement has figured out.

Your goal as a startup is to figure out your formula, not to grow immediately,
and not to hit numbers at all costs. It is a learning process. Most assume
that by setting goals and quotas they can tease that learning out. The problem
is that most people are wired to swim at all costs and not drown. It’s human
nature.

So, in closing, show your sales friends some empathy. Engage them in the
process of learning and incentivize them to learn. To reduce them to
simplistic bloodhounds — smelling blood, and chasing down deals at all costs —
is a disservice.

  * Pick a buyer persona and stick with that group. Run the test!
  * Test one or two techniques simultaneously (scripts, marketing, on-boarding, etc.)
  * Be willing to walk away
  * Stop fetishizing sales heroics. Fetishize learning heroics!
  * Form shared understanding around a typical journey map that spans teams

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*7pCG2R6cOLWYDGR_LAiCKQ.png)

Too often we focus solely on accountability, alignment, and efficiency. This
fixation frequently manifests in silos, politics, title obsession, and
hierarchies. Instead of focusing on what we need to build an awesome product—
safety, trust, and a diversity of viewpoints and skill-sets — we sub-optimize
to preserve the neat and tidy boxes. The turf-war benefits no one. And neither
does creating a shadow market of skills where people are not acknowledged and
recognized for the work they _really_ do.

**So what do _you_ need? What does your _product_ need? What do your _teams_ need? **Talk over these needs and hats with your team. Be flexible. Let people do what they’re good at, or want to learn more about. It will be “messy”, but the neat and tidy just results in crappy product.


# Go Towards The Discomfort (It’s A Sign)

### Go Towards The Discomfort (It’s A Sign)

#### … and stop doing things that make sense

_Illustrations by _[_Claire Bowman_](http://claire-bowman.squarespace.com/)_.
Editing help from Kate Maurer._

I woke up yesterday, but felt like I hadn’t slept. A bunch of leftover work
week worries bubbled up, stirred up by some good ol’ [imposter
syndrome](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/your-money/learning-to-deal-with-
the-impostor-syndrome.html?_r=0) (preparing for conferences will do that).
Notifications buzzed from my phone in the other room. Sun dripped through the
blinds — it was going to be a nice day. Then there was that moment of tension:

_Do I get out of my head, go out, see friends, and enjoy the weather (which I
know is 100% effective at making me feel better), or do I withdraw and spend
the day working and mulling over my angst?_

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*jUfZDveIlz7VakyS4Vlvwg.jpeg)

I often opt for the latter, with reliably poor results. Weird, right?

You’ve felt that before. Maybe not with work angst, but with _something_:
picking the healthy food option, choosing to exercise after a long day at
work, giving someone a second chance, checking to see if the stranger on the
street is OK, or listening when you want to talk. Sometimes it is a simple
case of short-term benefit versus long-term gain. At other times these small
decisions cut straight to our fears, self-perception, and self-doubt.

Part of the brain is saying “You know the right thing to do! Push through!
Take a risk!” But there’s that other voice saying “That’s hard! Keep the
status quo! Make it go away! Time for dessert!” Should we do something that
feels unnatural, dangerous, impractical, uncomfortable, worrying, challenging?
Or do we just roll with it?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*nXcVN_iE3NABLBbTzS1L9g.png)

That uncomfortable moment is a sign. It’s a **beacon**.

We experience these small decision points every day — as individuals, in
relationships and families, and as organizations and communities. But if we
opt for one path repeatedly, the beacon fades to a faint blip, and our neural
connections harden and stiffen. When that happens, we turn on the autopilot
(also known [System 1 thinking](http://bigthink.com/delancey-place/the-two-
systems-of-cognitive-processes), or the aptly named [lizard
brain](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/01/quieting-the-lizard-
brain.html)). In this mode, we act without thinking, and generally let our
fears rule us.

Until that happens, we have a chance, because we sense that moment of tension.
And that moment is an opportunity. Those small decisions add up.

What applies on the individual level also applies to how we work together in
communities and organizations. The road to organizational dysfunction is paved
with many common-sense, split-second, well-meaning, and very human decisions.

If you ask most people what they value in a work situation they will describe
things like autonomy, diversity, open communication, challenge, honesty,
coherence, a sense of purpose, and acknowledgment. Even more fundamentally, we
require safety, trust, and respect.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*2LhW2K7CtvUXZB5LV3CJdg.png)

Contact me for a higher res version. This is a work in progress.

We set out with the best intentions, but go astray. Our many “common-sense”
decisions result in outcomes that run counter to our values, and over time a
stark incongruence settles like a fog. How often do we compromise on quality,
or humanity, or diversity, or trust, or transparency? Often. And that is when
things slip.

Some of these choices are automatic, and there’s no time to pluck the signal
from the noise. But, in most cases, there’s that glowing beacon — that split
second of tension and resistance — that indicates a better path is possible.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*Ym91rCVYUMa1e9yb21Hqlg.jpeg)

You’ll often know these moments just by the words you use. Do any of these
snippets sound familiar?

> You’ll have to do that, because, well…**just because**.

> Perhaps **we shouldn’t share** that information. It might anger people.

> Let’s **be practical**. There’s **no way** that will work here.

> **How can we say no** at this point? We’re in too deep!

> Well, **it’s human** to just be worried about your own quota.

> We **can let it slip just this one time**. No one will notice.

You and your coworker probably know that you should **NOT** talk about someone
behind their back. You know you **SHOULD** include them and get real, but
habit kicks in. And there’s the challenge.

It’s human to buckle, and it’s human to take uncomfortable risks. It’s also
human to delude yourself, but also human — and possible — to [get to yes with
yourself](http://www.williamury.com/books/getting-to-yes-with-yourself/). We
are simultaneously creatures of habit and creatures of insight.

Which is awesome, if you think about it. We’re not doomed to repeat our
mistakes and send our organizations into an ugly spiral. The trick is to sense
those moments — the spark, instability, tension, momentary fear — and go
toward the discomfort. Adopt the beginner’s brain, and let that be your guide.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*6rr4zgvFyLPTs0VYe8XRxQ.jpeg)

We can sniff out these opportunities because they have many common traits. You
can help your teams learn to be aware of them. To hone their radar — not for a
particular solution, not for “the way,” but for an opportunity.

At the core here we have a very human challenge, compounded by having LOTS of
humans in the picture. One response is to call the steady slide some variant
of the human condition, throw your hands up, and resign yourself to a steady
[drift into failure](https://www.govloop.com/community/blog/how-organizations-
fail-part-two-drifting-into-failure/).

Another perspective — the one I’ve been taking lately — is that every decision
is an opportunity: in our personal lives, in our work lives, and at the
intersection of the two. We can turn to face the discomfort and move forward,
or we can keep the status quo. In the process, we’ll mess up — that’s life.
But it’s the meditative practice of sensing these moments of tension,
acknowledging the path of habit and inertia, and taking the uncomfortable
route that counts.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*bump1Indr5DU5O9vvsuKKg.jpeg)

How can we, as individuals, be clear with ourselves, and then bring that to
our organizations? It starts with emotional safety, and in the end requires
facing our discomfort. But it is possible.

Product is not something you “ship”. Increasingly, it is a service that the
whole organization _delivers continuously. _Tossing things over the wall isn’t
going to cut it. Dividing up your organization will restrict the flow of
valuable information. Aligning yourself around anything other than the end-to-
end customer experience is a form of sub-optimization. Any poor user
experience — using the software, on the phone with support, learning, buying,
or renewing — can sink you.

So when folks go on and on about defining product management … ask why? The
product is everything. Don’t let the anchor of old ways of delivering physical
software products weigh you down. You’re in the [service delivery and
design](http://www.servicedesigntools.org/) business now. Embrace it!

### What Does “Sales-Driven” Even Mean?

I frequently use the term “sales-driven” and contrast it with other focus
descriptors like product-driven, technology-driven, and marketing-driven.
Until recently I didn’t give the phrase much thought. I sort of knew what it
meant — and so did most people I spoke to — but to be honest I had a tough
time describing it. So what do I mean?

When taking a sales-driven approach you:

  1. Prioritize the curb-appeal of your product over long-term customer value. For example, you actively build and sell flashy features which provide limited lasting value or fail to deliver on the sales promise. In short, you focus on what sells or attracts attention vs. what works
  2. Allow sales opportunities to impact the product roadmap disproportionately. Agreeing to build something for a prospect is a major commitment, as even the savviest prospects tend to botch their requirements. It is also rare for a hastily developed feature to be productized vs. being held together with bailing wire for the customer. More often than not, the sales-driven roadmap item becomes a liability and sits in limbo.
  3. Let sales dictate the target persona (or lack thereof). As product people, we build products with specific “jobs to be done”, people, needs, and psychologies in mind. In a sales-driven approach, there will often be a mismatch between product’s target end users, and the people you sell to. Sometimes the sales target is simply broader, but often it is just plain different.
  4. Saying No is one of the toughest things in product management. When selling, you’ll inevitably hear about ancillary and complimentary needs. They love your product, and if it can do [insert something else] they’ll love it even more. A sales-driven approach tends to guide your product management hand a bit broader than a product-driven approach.
  5. A sales-driven company tends to prioritize developing new features over optimizing existing features for existing customers. A bulleted list of features is the calling card for new sales. The bigger the list, the more doors that open.

Most businesses need some form of sales. You can be amazingly good at sales,
but not be sales-driven. A product-driven company doesn’t stop selling …
rather it puts more emphasis on assuring that customers get value out of the
product vs. drive the car off the lot. Before jumping to the next feature, you
validate that you’ve hit the mark.

As a UX-centric product person, I tend to feel better about my work when I’m
working in a product-driven setting. It just feels more focused, sustainable,
and impactful. I’ve also been bitten numerous times by the byproducts of a
prolonged sales-driven effort. That said, countless businesses have succeeded
by taking a sales-driven stance. On some level, it boils down to your sense of
craft, and your tolerance for things to be a little less-than-ideal for your
existing customers.

And with some products you have no choice. The market is competitive, busy,
and fierce, and it is hard to sell on differentiation. No matter how you slice
it, your product is not going to sell itself. You will win BECAUSE you learn
how to out-sell and outmaneuver the competition. Like it or not, your product
is secondary.

# Before You Join A Startup …

When you join a venture-funded startup, remember that you’re playing someone
else’s game.

* * *

### Before You Join A Startup …

When you join a venture-funded startup, remember that you’re playing someone
else’s game.

There are plenty of business models — creative agencies / consultancies, for
example — that group people by a passion for doing great work and making a
reasonable salary. Most venture funded startups are not in this category. So
you have to come to accept that.

One of the harshest realities of the startup world is that what can be good
for your investors (and founders even), might not jive well with your sense of
craft, responsibility, and happiness. And that’s no one’s fault. It just is
how it is. The economics, risk profile, and odds dictate the tactics. The
letdown comes when you believe otherwise.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*HqV_INUN2nZBDmCF-zHFbA.png)

<http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/24/deciphering-the-economics-of-venture-
capital/>

What is right for the customer, right for your sense of intellectual rigor,
and right for your sense of a job well done, aren’t always right for someone
else’s portfolio. Again, you’re playing two different games. You might be
trying to grow a healthy vegetable garden. They’re trying to build an oasis in
the desert. Your veggie garden is the much derided “lifestyle business”, while
their oasis is the Unicorn. Neither is bad.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*_D7Yg02emrF-wyMZ2dHfeQ.png)

Reality check: some of the biggest venture “wins” come from land-grabs,
vaporware, accu-hires, and mediocre products. Interestingly, these wins are
often followed by refocusing on impact and culture — a big reversal — but
that’s for another post.

I remember being involved in the music business and watching my friends
struggle with the harsh world of the major labels. One month you were on top
of the world and the next month you were basically in $120k of debt to the
label. [Without that hit single, you weren’t much good to
anyone](http://www.negativland.com/news/?page_id=17). For better or worse
that’s how much of the startup world works.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*aI6IcxOgEVCCGTG2OUj2Kw.png)

Much of the startup world revolves around the heuristic that high growth
validates the business model, and that you can always find more efficiencies
down the road. Unfortunately, this provides little solace to those on the
front-lines. “Making the number” often doesn’t equate to “job well done”
(unless you’re in sales). Some folks like [Jason
Fried](https://medium.com/u/c030228809f2) and David Heinemeier Hansson
([DHH](https://medium.com/u/54bcbf647830)) have advocated heavily for the
craft and empathy focused middle ground, the “indie rock” of the startup
world, but that is rare.

This tension forms the backdrop to countless startup water-cooler
conversations (or private Slack channels, or coffee maker chats … pick your
poison). It happens so predictably and consistently that it almost feels
cliche. Anyone who has done their time in startups knows the script.

As an individual, it is important to ask yourself the hard questions. What
inspires you? Why do you show up day after day? Are you in this for a small
chance at a big upside? If it all burns to the ground — and most of the time
it does (financially, morally, culturally, or otherwise) — will you be happy
you were along for the ride?

The startup world holds a certain seduction. It is stripped of the politics,
the hard-and-fast rules, and the monotony. But remember to take a step back
and look at the big picture.

I love startups. I love the ride. But I’ve learned to understand (and respect)
it for what it is. And alas the irony: at some point you’ll have your own
thing and need to make the hard decisions. It’s never easy, but it’s always
interesting!

### Quit Planning Ahead and Keeping People Busy

As product people, we need to work more on the mission and less on playing
Tetris with teams and initiatives. To much planning ahead and chasing full
utilization will undo your product.

> Oh oh! We we can finish that in 6 days, right?, and then we can rotate them
to project Z, and … oh, well Mandy will be done with that thing, and we can
slide that project in there. If they finish that afternoon, Bill will present
his mockups and we can start on …

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*JiavS5lB-qVQNmaOKL8vnQ.png)

Your average PM will spend countless hours in meetings talking to non front-
line stakeholders about what their organizations will (or should) do at some
point in the future. They’ll make fancy gantt swim-lane roadmaps so that
everyone feels heard. And then talk about pet solutions, show mock-ups, make a
lot of guesses, play Tetris with initiatives, and pester engineers for
estimates. Towards what end? Why?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*15mf15mJocHueM9mNQJ6fA.png)

<https://siouxnetontrack.wordpress.com/page/8/>

They sincerely believe that this is their only option. Ironically, the more
they do it, the worse the results, and the more people feel that premature
alignment and multi-tasking are necessary. I mean gosh-golly, if we could just
“hit our commitments”! It’s a vicious cycle. But it doesn’t need to be that
way.

A microscopic amount of this “planning ahead” adds value. It is a symptom of
our preoccupation with full utilization, and it makes things WORSE.

We try to work out all the details in small groups so as not to “distract” the
teams while they juggle the four other things we’ve asked them to do. UX
hurries to prepare mock-ups (in isolation) so that the team will be able to
get started right away. More colorful lines get added to the roadmap swim-
lanes. And then what happens?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*J0T7PY2Y8YF1aZL1Kz6CSw.png)

<http://connectedprincipals.com/archives/10412>

We spend days/weeks trying to re-calibrate with the reality on the ground, get
the team engaged with a vision they had no part of, and work through all of
our faulty assumptions. And then rush to get the feature shipped to shut
everyone up only to find we missed the mark because our batch was huge and we
had 10 things on deck.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*Lo7EAH9vH8oqLDmMXDr7Rw.png)

Consider the alternative. The reality is you only need to plan for the very
next thing. And only in broad strokes. What counts is the mission: the
engaging outcome you hope to generate for your customers and business. Focus
instead (like 90%) on being present for the important task at hand. All this
other stuff — the freakish alignment meetings and pre-planning — is just
driven by people freaking out over nothing getting done.

What if the team finished what they were doing, and then engaged in a couple
of DAYS of collaborative design, spikes, and research? It might feel less
efficient, but it is far more effective. UX would sit down and work directly
with engineers to explore what was possible. Instead of paper prototypes,
you’d try testing working prototypes with real customer data. Simply put,
you’d be getting it done right.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*QDGubkwuQKlQePv2yg6BmA.png)

Take a step back, and ask yourself the hard question. Is any of the pre-
planning worth it? Really? If the team produced constant value and you could
prove it, would anyone care? Of course not, they’d keep letting you plow
along. Most people can’t because 80% of shipped features never really get used
or hit the mark. So as an alternative, we seek full utilization and the
fastest delivery of stakeholder guesses. That becomes our job.

Wrong! Don’t go there.

One of the biggest tips I can give product development teams is to keep the
planning inventory as low as possible. Get alignment on the mission, and stop
fixating on pet solutions. Slow down and focus to speed up. Don’t chase full
utilization. Let the team breath. Finish one thing and then start the next
thing. You’ll produce better results and move much faster.


# Enter Through The Narrow Gate (Go Deep)

### Enter Through The Narrow Gate (Go Deep)

> Enter through the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the road is broad
that leads to destruction, and there are many who go through it.  
> Matthew 7:13

Going broad is dangerous.

Imagine opening a sushi restaurant catering to both sushi aficionados and
sushi newbies. Try to decorate it to be a great date spot and a convenient
lunch option. Make it accessible to cost-conscious foodies and jet-setters.
Hire staff that can communicate with your Japanese clientele and explain sushi
to traveling Swedes. Seat people for 25 minutes and 3 hours. Does this sound
feasible?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*5-jWrdgukbnOoehFBRguBg.png)

Not really. I wouldn’t bet on it.

This type of broad focus is known as “going broad” and it is a startup killer.
Everything above falls under making “great sushi”, but the devil is in the
details. When it comes to startups, how do you know if you’re going too broad?

  1. You have to produce different marketing material for different buyers
  2. You find yourself dividing your limited resources among different product lines or value props
  3. You have a tough time understanding why a particular customer chose your product
  4. You find it difficult to prioritize work because the data is contradictory
  5. The features you do release only appeal to a small % of your customers
  6. Your support team struggles to service a wide variety of use case
  7. Your customers consider your product both “complicated” and “simple” simultaneously
  8. You take on service / consulting work to address the many edge cases
  9. You frequently receive diverse feature requests in the pre-sales process
  10. You find yourself describing your value proposition as being that of a platform, or a one-stop shop

As a startup PM, you’ll be always tempted to go broad. The temptation will be
fierce. Personally, you love your product, and you believe everyone should
too. It’s awesome to hear about all the compelling use cases people are
dreaming up, and all the minor (and major) enhancements they’d need to make it
all possible. So your heartstrings are being plucked.

Externally the pressure can be a lot tougher. Take the sushi venture example
above. You might find it easy to get all of those people to walk into your
restaurant. Signs and marketing do wonders. You’ve expanded your available
market to just about everyone. You might find it possible — through major
heroics — to please some portion of those people. All of that will make your
team euphoric. And once the ball starts rolling it is tough to put the brakes
on. But the mess you make in the process will be your undoing.

“Going broad” means trying to address the needs of too many buyer personas,
user personas, AND jobs to be done (desired work outcomes). They all matter.
Supporting the same user personas to do multiple jobs is difficult. Likewise,
supporting different types of users — even those with the same title — to do
the same job is equally complex. The tendency is to overgeneralize. You
segment by title (“accounts” for example) and perhaps business size (“SMB”),
but that’s about it. The differences between accountants working at SMBs are
vast.

We tend to model our startups after large enterprises while forgetting that it
took those companies many years (and decades in some cases) to support that
many product lines and use cases. It didn’t happen overnight. And it certainly
didn’t happen while they were trying to fight for their early existence.

The complexity of everything — product development, support, sales, and
marketing — increases exponentially with each buyer/user personas added to the
mix. No simple change in process will stem this tide.

So what do you do? I know this will be extremely painful and counterintuitive,
but get used to saying no much more than you say yes. By much more I’m talking
20x. Say no to prospects, no to feature requests, no to opportunities, no to
expansion, and no to new verticals.

This doesn’t mean don’t sell. Sell your heart out. But sell to one target
buyer personas and user persona.

And then, on the flipside, get extremely specific about the Who and the Why.
By extremely specific I am talking 20x more precise. People will get super
nervous because they’ll assume you’re limiting the TAM (total available
market) for your product. Rest assured that you’ll be better in the long run.

So: Say No. And Get Specific.


# The Unseen Product is Still The Product

host, the server, the food and drink, and the dishes and decor…

### The Unseen Product is Still The Product

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*kBpFVCAYx6Ni-ovqM6bsHw.png)

My favorite metaphor … restaurants

Imagine that you are at a restaurant. As a customer, you interact with the
host, the server, the food and drink, and the dishes and decor. It’s unlikely
that you’ll see or be very aware of what’s going on in the kitchen. But it
would be wrong to say that you don’t care about the kitchen. You likely care
about the cleanliness of the kitchen. You appreciate it when the food comes
out quickly. And you’re more likely to come back if the chef has time to
create thoughtful and unique specials.

In product development, we tend to think in terms of a wall between the inner
workings of an application and the outer, customer-facing side. The inner
workings are the work of engineers, and the outer workings are the work of UX
designers, interaction designers, and others.

But, if you take a step back, it becomes clear that this line is not a clear
one, and that the way an application is built affects usability as much as the
outward-facing aspects. How quickly does the software work? How smoothly? How
gracefully does it recover from errors? For a customer, the kitchen is as
important as the service.

The perceived barrier between engineering and product carries over into the
work of teams. We create divisions so that we don’t step on each other’s toes.
Engineering says “just tell us what you need” and takes it from there. Product
lays claim to the outward-facing aspects and is told not to meddle.

Neither of these views really gets the job done, and the worst outcome is that
critical backend work — technical debt removal, refactoring, testing — becomes
hidden from view. These goals don’t show up on the roadmap. They aren’t part
of a bulleted list. And DevOps teams tend to work on these critical aspects
under the radar for fear that the time needed to do them will be grabbed for
other priorities. Or, companies sit on debt and delay addressing these issues
because they believe that at some later point they’ll have the time.

But product folks need to understand that this all contributes directly to the
end-product. It is crazy to turn a blind eye to it. Your next epic might very
well be a technical debt workdown, or a test coverage sprint. Not only does
the craft of DevOps contribute directly to the overall user experience, but
awesomely supported and appropriately architected software empowers you to
release product. It’s the foundation that allows you to ship fast and
fearlessly and gives you the freedom to experiment and create.

So take a whole-team approach to product development and expand your view of
what “customer-facing” means. Don’t let your unsung heroes to go unsung.
Embrace the craft of DevOps and seek synergy with an awesome customer-facing
UX team. Encourage people to be transparent about what they’re working on.
Keep in mind that many of the great products you love are great because of
DevOps and a dialed-in process.


# You Don’t Need A “Great Product”

There’s an uncomfortable truth about product development:

* * *

### You Don’t Need A “Great Product”

There’s an uncomfortable truth about product development:

It’s possible to hit the numbers and grow quickly with a crappy product
(and/or crappy organizational culture). It’s possible to have a grand exit
even when your team knows it is all snake-oil.

You can throw Lean Startup, 4 Steps to the Epiphany, The Hard Thing About Hard
Things, and Zero to One in the trash, and still do awesome. Yet we obsesses
about “Great Product”.

It will not last and at some point, you’ll end up paying for it. But if your
goal is “up and to the right” there are a million ways to grow. If you’re
lucky, you can keep this up for a long, long time. Long enough, perhaps, to
never have to deal personally with it. Long enough to enjoy a personal exit
event, take a break, and come back ready to build a “real” product.

I’m not talking in the very early stages. You’ll need to do something right at
that stage. Shortly after that you will see the signs. I spoke with a friend
recently who took a roller coaster ride with a big startup in NYC. “Everyone
knew from almost the beginning,” she explained, “that our model was
unsustainable and flawed. But at a certain point, you just get tired of making
the case. Everything was growing and looked good on paper, so we just went
with it.”

I hear this over and over. Those on the front-lines sense the problem very
early, but it can take years to work it out of the system.

Why does this happen?

Most tech startups make central assumptions about economies of scale. The
thought is that eventually, at some point, you’ll figure something out.
Someone will want to buy you for your tech (or people), you’ll find new and
cheaper channels, or you’ll find the right “synergy” with an acquirer. A lot
of tech innovation hinges on long term shifts in usage for “mainstream”
business (e.g. Bring Your Own Device, Enterprise Mobility, Big Data, etc.). So
it is possible to drink the Koolaid — maybe even spike it — for a long time.

The temptation to just keep growing is just too strong. And frankly, at a
certain point it can be tempting to cut product corners and leave certain
assumptions unvalidated.

So, let me get to the point. At the end of the day, you need to ask yourself
about what you value. What is your mission? What matters to you?

If it’s “go IPO”, “have an exit”, “make shit loads of money”, “get acquired”,
or anything like that … well, embrace the optics. Embrace all the ways you can
keep the train moving. Play that game.

If it’s “build stuff people love and make a difference” or “build a
sustainable model that keeps people employed making great software” (my
personal favorite) then embrace that. Let that muse guide you. You’ll need to
resist all sorts of temptation to cut corners early on. You’ll need to grow
more slowly and be intellectually and emotionally honest with yourself. But
just let that be your thing. You might even find that the prior goals just
happen organically.

Pick a path with no regrets.


# Is Agile Dead?

Is Agile dead? Is it outdated? Does it suck?

### Is Agile Dead?

Is Agile **dead**? Is it **outdated**? Does it **suck**?

You tell me … how many of your work interactions are:

  * Humane
  * Curious
  * Observant
  * Creative
  * Diverse
  * Effective
  * Adaptable
  * Emotionally Honest
  * Intellectually Honest
  * Safe
  * Hopeful
  * Sustainable
  * Respectful
  * Reflective ?

Maybe for fleeting moment? Maybe for a year during the “good times”? Maybe
when you “had a great team once, on that project”?

Exactly. We can always do _better_. If scrum isn’t your thing, then find
something _better_.

Agile is a reminder that there’s always room for more empathy, happiness, and
impact in our work and personal lives. Beyond the infographics, methods,
acronyms, debates, books, white-papers, and rants, exists a simple set of
guidelines to [collaborate, deliver, reflect, and improve
by](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Rediscovering+the+Heart+of+Agile).

This is why I’m so happy to be attending (and speaking at) Alistair Cockburn’s
[Heart of Agile conference in Philly](http://heartofagile.com/heart-of-agile-
philadelphia/). Because it’s good to give yourself (and your teams) permission
to be hopeful and curious.

See you there!

### Focus is the Ultimate Process

When confronted with workplace dysfunction, missed connections, or poor
communication, we frequently assume that we need to address a process issue.
If we only had the right tools and the right systems, we could untangle
things. So we tweak and retweak processes, arrange meetings, and try to get
(or buy) systems that promise to link together all of the information team
members need and make it all work. But, does it ever _really _work?

What if process isn’t the problem?

We tend to identify problems as process problems when, in fact, they are focus
problems.

A great example is the question of how to handle customer feature requests. On
the surface it appears as if this is a process problem. How do you track those
requests, regularly update customers, and figure out how to prioritize those
requests in the product backlog? The temptation is to purchase a bunch of
tools and systems and implement a feature request tracking system. But, take a
step back. How awesome would it be if your team was always cranking out
valuable features? If, rather than fill the pipeline with requests to be
managed, you solved a focused problem and had customers lining up due to word
of mouth? How could you focus to make that happen?

From a broader organizational perspective, consider something like performance
reviews. In truth, we know that intrinsic motivation is what works, and yet we
create complex processes and systems of incentives to keep the ship on the
rails and to have a paper trail of accountability. But what if none of that
was a problem? What would it look like if everyone was held accountable by
their own passion for the work?

Process itself isn’t a problem. But when we’re working on process in product
development we should consider whether we’re really treating symptoms of a
lack of focus. Is that tracking system only needed because we’re trying to do
too many things at once? Do we think we need to massively customize a CRM when
really we’re just trying to handle too many customers at once? In start-ups it
is easy to mistake a problem as one of scaling or “growing pains,” when, in
fact, your problem is that you’re trying to cram in as much work as possible
rather than [do a few things well](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/enter-
through-the-narrow-gate-go-deep-c2d6528e380a#.o5n8ofmgq).

We need to differentiate between process that enables innovation, and process
that is applied from above to band-aid symptoms of a deeper problem. Ideal
process can be a dynamic, iterative working agreement among motivated people.
But process for its own sake or process that is used to exert control can be
poisonous. This is the reason so many management consultants and “change
initiatives” fail to achieve their goals.

We tend to treat product visions as Tweet-length Mad Libs. They lack bite,
resonance, and cohesiveness. It just feels like you’re going through the
motions.

But what makes a product vision powerful? To me, the format matters less than
the content.

  1. It engages and inspires all members of the team. It presents a goal that unites the development team, the customers and users, and the business. Proposing a business goal without describing the human benefits doesn’t provide inspiration.
  2. It connects the _who_ and the _why_ through a narrative. It identifies the human beings involved and the outcomes you’d like to create for them. It is phrased in a way that identifies its impact on people, even if you’re talking about machines and code.
  3. It has a clear story arc that leads from now into the future. It describes the present state, the change needed, and the vision of a better state.
  4. It is written in language that the whole team understands and avoids marketing-speak or overly technical language. It should be easy to explain to new team members, even if they don’t know all of the details.
  5. It is presented in ways that engage various senses and ways of understanding — visual and auditory as well as verbal.
  6. It is detailed enough to feel precise and focused, but broad enough to leave room for creativity and individuality. Team members have leeway to dream up solutions.
  7. It provides enough direction for team members to take action. It makes it easy for them to make decisions. It provides a true north. Team members don’t need to second-guess themselves or ask for permission.
  8. It is singular and dominant and matches the reality of the team’s activities. Other activities don’t take up 80% of the team’s time. Your vision comprises the 80%, and other tasks are the periphery.
  9. There is a clear goal that the team can strive for in the immediate future, even if the overall vision is open-ended. There are ways to know if you’re on track (leading indicators) and ways to know that your efforts made a difference (trailing indicators and outcomes).
  10. It is achievable, or at least allows for concrete incremental progress. It doesn’t feel purely aspirational or top-down.
  11. It is logically connected to a larger goal, if one exists. If the mission addresses a problem in order to allow progress on a different problem, that relationship is clear.
  12. Team members can take it seriously, knowing that they won’t see the company do things that clash with the vision. No one just gives it lip service. If you were to put it up on the wall, no one would think it was annoying. In other words, it passes the bullshit test.


# Where Do We Put The UX Tasks?

In my career I’ve heard this conversation play out over and over:

* * *

### Where Do We Put The UX Tasks?

In my career I’ve heard this conversation play out over and over:

**Eng:** “Um, we have no idea what UX is even doing.”  
**UX:** “OK, why don’t we try to add the UX tickets to Jira.”  
**Eng:** “Um. Damn. That many stories? That is going to clutter everything up.”  
**UX:** “Product, what should I be getting ahead of … ?”  
**Prod:** “Well, um, I have this Google Doc you can look at.”  
**Eng:** “What’s next? Is this ready to be worked on?”

I’ve seen teams try these three options to remedy the situation:

#### Option 1: Keep UX work in a separate system

Product and UX maintains intricate to-do lists for design and research work
OUTSIDE of the primary ticketing system.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*A3aIVO8RHXo9Z_wavFQ8Dw.png)

  * **_Pros:_** It keeps the ticketing system “clean and uncluttered.”
  * **_Con:_** No one knows what UX is working on, and it is impossible to view the dependencies. The backlog is obscured making it tough to get the “big picture”

**Notes: **UXers often have a difficult time explaining the rhythm of their work. They regularly scan for work on the horizon, and “get ahead” of that work by doing research, producing mockups, tinkering, etc. These systems are highly individual. I’ve seen designers use Trello, Basecamp, Google Tasks, stickies, and their notebooks to manage this work. In many cases, it goes unappreciated simply because it is not visible.

#### Option 2: Track UX work in the ticketing system as distinct and separate
tickets

When UX is working on something, it is described as being In Progress (along
with engineering work)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*yJxE4NZ8nqkBuGo3mpiTWw.png)

  * **_Pros:_** A clear sense of WIP (work in progress), and the current burden on UX
  * **_Con:_** Too much clutter / too many tickets, and UX work often falls out of sync with release cycle

**Notes:** The trouble here is that design work itself is not shippable, and again it often doesn’t flow in the same way that engineering work flows. So you’ll finish a sprint and the board — digital or physical — will become cluttered with design tickets. Ideally, you’ll have a “Shipped” status, and therein lies the problem. Unless this design work is related to a customer-consumable / shippable item, it isn’t Done. You could argue that this approach is problematic for user-stories in general. Any time you break up a story based on functional roles (back-end/front-end, for example), you are diluting the story and creating a dependency management game.

#### Option 3: Track UX as work related to user-focused tickets

UX work is attached to a user-focused story, from early phase backlog
refinement to shipped/done

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*EyWfsXX4vnYjYRcJjXsQpg.png)

  * **_Pros:_** Clearly describes dependencies. Allows for a “pull” system for design and research which promotes just-in-time work. Remains very user-goal focused
  * **_Cons:_** May require sub-tasks, and multiple people assigned to a particular ticket. Requires strong stories and story splitting practices

**Notes:** If UX is getting involved on a ticket before engineering (in an analysis/ design/research phase), then it is reasonable to call that work exactly what it is: analysis/design/research. It is similar to the work of engineering architects, business analysts, etc. Some models, like LeanUX, favor less upfront work and eschew the staggered sprint approach. Other teams do a good bit of pre-planning and design before they hand it off to engineering. When the work starts, it typically throws off lots of design tasks along with QA and engineering tasks. These remain with the story.

My bias is for Option 3. It strikes the best balance between:

  1. Preventing unnecessary pre-work (we’ve all had efforts killed after being reassured that the work was, in fact, going to happen)
  2. Keeping the system clean
  3. Reflecting reality
  4. Clearly describing the value-stream, as work further to the right gets closer to release and customer outcomes
  5. Giving “credit” to UX for the work they do that goes unappreciated

Let me know what you think. What has worked for you?

### Is It Safe for Your Team to Get “Real”

[Industrial Logic](https://medium.com/u/9338d76c0d7a)’s [Joshua
Kerievsky](https://medium.com/u/28229c304ac9) writes:

How true! When I am talking to a new team, there is one thing I zero in on
very early in the game. It sits below all the methodologies, practices,
cultural manifestos, and vision statements. It is the absolute prerequisite to
meaningful continuous improvement.

Can your whole team get “real” when it counts? Is it safe for someone to say:

> “I’m not comfortable about where this project is going …”

> “We’re feeling a bit bullied lately …”

> “I’m overwhelmed, and I can’t reasonably keep up with this workload …”

> “This isn’t meeting my expectations …”

> “I’m confused about what we stand for here …”

> “We aren’t living up to our mission and here’s why …”

Common wisdom says that these types of conversations are out of bounds. You’ll
hear arguments like “people aren’t comfortable talking about this kind of
stuff” or “this is better off dealt with in a much smaller group.” We seek to
contain this talk, subdue it, and silence and control it. Even the thought of
“going there” feels a little awkward and scary.

If you let these tensions fester, you’ll often start hearing small groups of
people say things like:

> “It isn’t worth bringing it up anymore. We just can’t change this.”

> “That’s just the way it is. Not much we can do about it.”

> “Let’s keep this between you and me …”

> “I don’t feel comfortable talking to [my boss] about this. She’s part of the
problem.”

> “I’m just waiting for the most politically opportune time to … ”

At any given point our organizations carry the “debt” of these unresolved
tensions. Importantly, different individuals process these pressures in a
variety of ways. Some people:

  * can disconnect at the end of a challenging day, month, or quarter. Unless the dissonance threatens their job, they’ll take a certain level of dissonance in stride
  * internalize that tension. It’s stressful, but they aren’t wired to fight or raise a stink
  * form alliances and pockets of resistance, and share gripes to blow off steam
  * serve as spokesperson for the less vocal team members, and take the brunt of the pushback
  * just up and leave

The important point here is that you wont always see a mass exodus or a big
uprising.

These unresolved tensions can hamper an organization for years because the
impact is rarely some cataclysmic event that rocks the system at its core. The
fed up folks will leave. And those who remain will find a way to coexist,
accepting the fact that it isn’t quite safe enough to openly voice their
concerns. What permeates is an all too common “low-level dissatisfaction” …
people don’t love what is going on, but they don’t hate it enough (or their
living situation doesn’t allow) for them to leave.

The irony is that it is these very same people that get called out for being
disengaged when the consultants role in.

We direct much attention towards change management. In my experience, the
seeds of change are already present in your organization. At some level —
typically the level closest to the work — there is an awareness of what is
“wrong”. The trick is creating an environment which is safe enough to let
those with that awareness speak openly and own a path forward. Without that
safety, no amount of process, assistance from consultants, hyping the culture,
or empty statements of vision will allow you to turn the corner.

What has worked for you? How do you create this level of safety?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*yhyG0HCQOGROTZG1lJwGSg.png)

The Atlantic: <http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/02/lets-
just-make-the-startup-coffee-shop-thing-official/71603/>

It’s just a _lifestyle_ business for them.

As opposed to?

Something bigger. Something that’ll grow. You know, just more _serious_.

I don’t know. She really loves the small team vibe and building a great
product without the politics.

But that can’t _scale_! You know that. How are they going to take that to the
_next level_?

What’s the next level? How do you level-up?

_Bigger_ customers. _More_ customers. I mean at some point someone needs to
get a return … right? It shows a real lack of _ambition_ if you ask me.

I think they’re doing pretty well actually. And they don’t owe anyone any
money.

Exactly. It’s a _lifestyle_ business. It affords her and the team a certain
_lifestyle_. Nothing more. Do you see the pictures on Facebook of her on
vacation and stuff? It’s for that. That’s a _lifestyle_.

You mean, it doesn’t consume your life? Isn’t playing the startup game a
lifestyle decision? Look at all of these people in this cafe talking about
pivots, exits, and disruption. This sort of seems like a _lifestyle_.

It’ll only go far! What’s the most she’ll ever pocket … a couple million?
(Turns to eye the people walking into the cafe)

I think they’ve done studies on this. I’m not sure you’re happier after $100k
a year (or something close to that). She legitimately enjoys showing up,
working with the team, and building something people enjoy using. It’s like a
group of craftsmen. Or a really good auto-shop or something.

Exactly! Those are **_LOCAL_** businesses. Come on, you know what we’re
talking about. The **_SHOW_**. The **_GAME!_** Do you know how much [ — — — ]
grew last quarter? That is SICK! That’s leverage …

How will that actually help the majority of people at [ — — —] ? Three years
from now when they’ve been acquihired, management turns over, and they’ve
pivoted six times … what will it all mean? And point of note … there are three
doctor’s offices within a mile from here that have more revenue than half of
the startups you’re “tracking”.

That’s the price of progress. Of growth. Did Google think small?

You could argue that Google figured out how to print money. And they were
passionate about something. Just like our friend.

… Look over there. That’s [ — — — ] from [ — — —]. I wonder if they’re doing a
deal? I’ve heard some whispers ….

Listen to yourself. This is totally a _lifestyle_ for you!

No it’s not … it’s a _passion_.

And …

We live in San Francisco. Tell me with a straight face that this isn’t a
_lifestyle_ …

Um. I mean I guess it is a “way of life”

And …

OK. It’s a _lifestyle_.

So it is all a lifestyle choice. There you go.

### Focus on These 8 Things to Build Better Products

If you focus on these eight concepts you _WILL_ build better products. It will
not be easy, and it will not be instant. You’ll probably get a lot of pushback
and ruffle some feathers, but I promise that your product/service will
benefit.

As product development teams we spend a great deal of time looking for “the
answer”. We often adopt methodologies as a safety blanket, and then lose faith
when the situation changes. Sure, I’ve provided some examples. But your teams
are smart! Let them experiment with the how. Paint these broad goals and let
them lead you.

Build a better product by …

#### **1\. Shortening the distance between the product development team (UX
and engineering) and the customer**

_For example …_

  * Team fieldtrips to visit customers onsite
  * Biweekly lunch and learns with moderated customer discussion
  * Allow any front-line team member to pick up phone and call customer
  * Hire full-time UX researchers, with goal to share research and engage others in research

**Why?** With each hop you lose signal. Efforts to filter this information to make it more “actionable” are largely ineffective

#### **2\. Accelerating any form of learning about your customers, market,
technology, self, team, and organization**

_For example …_

  * Regular team retrospectives, outings, and conversations
  * Voice-of-customer programs, access to accurate usage metrics, regular presentations on competitors and trends
  * [Pairing](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html), [mob-programming](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwjjlLHTm5LNAhUj6oMKHVMECWYQFggcMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmobprogramming.org%2F&usg=AFQjCNFVo2f2MB1mXp_PVpzRpid13GOfcg&bvm=bv.123664746,d.dmo), mentor program
  * Offer experiment-design training, and share results broadly
  * Celebrate learning! Share broadly. Share visibly

**Why? **Your team’s collective learning is your organization’s foremost asset. Left unshared, it depreciates almost immediately

#### **3\. Watching a real user use your product to get their job done**

_For example …_

  * Moderated and unmoderated usability tests
  * Diary studies with screen-share (e.g. always-on GoToMeeting study)
  * Session recording, click-stream analysis

**Why? **To get out of your own head! No use is arguing about whose guess is better

#### **4\. Making it possible to deliver software more fearlessly and with
less drama**

_For example …_

  * Test driven development, automated testing, CI, “stop the line” mandate (with no repercussions)
  * Feature flags, beta groups, prototype framework
  * Invest in DevOps

**Why?** If you work scared, you’ll take no risks

#### **5\. Reducing the number of dependencies and constraints**

_For example …_

  * SOA, plan for obsolescence and change vs. hardening and future-proofing
  * Teams aligned around distinct value streams vs. organized around architecture or skill-sets
  * Fewer promises to customers, and other stakeholders (internal and external)
  * Late binding of teams (vs. pre-assigning epics to teams months in advance)
  * Just-in-time planning, co-design, design sprints, etc.

**Why?** You can’t move quickly with your hands tied. And if you try, you’ll have mediocre results

#### **6\. Promoting diversity, and engaging the minority viewpoint**

_For example …_

  * Diverse hiring teams, self-selecting teams and projects, voluntary team rotation
  * Tailor activities to different communication and learning styles
  * Leaders speak last. Coach on listening and communication skills (while respecting diversity)
  * Anonymous surveys (if safety level is low)
  * [Ritual dissent](http://cognitive-edge.com/methods/ritual-dissent/)

**Why**? If everyone thinks the same and is forced to agree with the loudest voice, you’ll never explore different perspectives.

#### **7\. Fostering creativity and freedom to explore and experiment**

_For example …_

  * Describe the end-goal vs. a particular solution. In other words, promote creative solutions for “normal” work
  * Teams self-select stretch innovation project after completing “normal” feature
  * Get individuals out of functional silo (UXers code, engineers design)
  * 10% time, idea marketplaces (Tinder for collaborating on projects), co-design with customers

**Why:** If you are 100% delivery focused, you’ll eventually hit the point when the luck runs out. We all crave a sense of impact and get a buzz from trying something new. Bonus: this is how you innovate … not some lab or hack day.

#### 8\. Bridging silos

_For example …_

  * All employees spend time in support queue
  * Marketing and sales engaged in group design activities
  * Front-line teams present to senior management (not a middle-person)

**Why:** Silos inhibit the flow of information.


# Check out this presentation I’ve been giving lately.

https://prezi.com/dgedeyma2nqr/rtp-product-camp/

* * *

Check out this presentation I’ve been giving lately. I think it touches on
many of the issues you mention. Specifically:

<https://prezi.com/dgedeyma2nqr/rtp-product-camp/>

1) the role of Trust on teams  
2) the story (the “why”)  
3) safe to fail experiments (without that, data is a trust proxy)  
4) measurement as a learning catalyst  
5) intuition is “Data”  
6) sometimes you just wont know. You have to take the leap and then validate

If a team is paralyzed, afraid to take a risk, and not feeling a sense of
impact overall … then no amount of data-driven mumbo-jumbo will solve the
problem. “Data-driven” is not the end goal. You don’t feel proud because you
work at a drive-driven company. You feel proud because you have a sense of
impact. You feel the impact of your work (in your words impact-driven).

Now … being a “learning-driven” company resonates, as your collective learning
as an organization can be your greatest asset. But when you’re on your
deathbed do you say “damn, I worked for an AWESOME data-driven company?” No …
you say “I changed people’s lives” or “we kicked ass” or “I got to build great
things that helped people” or “I worked with people I trusted”.

The answer is very rarely delivered on a platter. You often have to build and
act in order to learn. That’s what you have to address first. If people feel
in inability to act or respond, they will often resort to feeling incredibly
attached to data to drive the original decision to act. So, if you repeatedly
pull people off projects without giving them the ability to learn/respond,
people will harp about data. Why? Because they’ve gotten burned! They put work
in and didn’t see the impact of their work?

So … great piece. Encourage a bias to action. Give a leeway to experiment
towards a goal. Admit when things aren’t working. And at that point the “data”
is just a tool, no more.

# That B2B SaaS Savvy Thing

I have received a lot of questions about a graphic I posted on Twitter
recently:

### That B2B SaaS Savvy Thing

I have received a lot of questions about a graphic I [posted on Twitter
recently](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/746480856122941440):

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*s1SM8b3qHrOvaVIZ1fUwUw.png)

Let me explain it in more depth.

Product personas often feature some version of the “savviness” scale. The idea
is pretty simple: some humans are skilled at [insert competency here], and
others are not. An accounting product might feature:

  * Accounting savvy
  * Technical savvy
  * Management savvy

The challenge is as follows. Product and UX are acutely aware that it is
difficult to build a product for users with different savviness levels. But it
can be tough to line up the organization around that conviction, especially in
the light of mixed messages from the market.

Prospects with **low savvy **can be relatively easy to sell to and close. They
feel the pain acutely, but are less demanding and selective. The trouble
arrises when you try to make these customers successful with the product.
Let’s say you lack exercise savvy and are rapidly gaining weight. You’ll be
easily persuaded to join a gym (**high perceived product value**). But you’ll
need constant monitoring, coaching, and coaxing (**low ability to be
successful with product**). Confoundingly, this has nothing to do with budget.
Some of the biggest deals come from the least savvy prospects.

**Medium savvy** customers are a mysterious bunch. They’re aware enough to know what’s possible, and shop more aggressively. The RFP magically grows in scope as they eagerly pile on feature requirements. When I worked at a bike store we joked that the “moderately informed” customer was the toughest to sell and please. But once you got them on a good bike (and put to rest their misguided assumptions) they had the most fun! So they may initially see **low perceived value** in the product, but have the **most to gain** in their **ability to be successful **with the product.

**High savvy** customers, on the other hand, are selective but realistic. They understand the limits of products, and mix-match to achieve their goals. For example, I am a savvy user of analytics tools. Yes I’m somewhat finicky about features, but I know that you need a quiver of tools to do the best job, and that there is often no one right way. I’m able to extract a lot of value out of products, but in so doing they become somewhat interchangeable. The delta from perceived value to actual value is diminished compared to the **medium savvy** user.

The takeaways is that the behavioral traits that might predict a sale are
often not the same traits that will indicate the ability for a customer to
thrive using your product. This isn’t to imply that targeting less savvy users
is a bad idea but rather that _trying to target all three is a bad idea
_(unless you’ve truly nailed one, and are ready to branch out). Even if the
sales are rolling in. Someone (usually customer success, customer support, or
product) will feel the sting.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*feWFzjTjlWXhUxdYna7YZg.png)

You need to target the same persona with intent across the full customer
journey including marketing, sales, on-boarding, product, and customers
success. They’re unique, and each require a unique approach. Don’t silo the
persona building activity inside the product team. Extend it across the whole
organization, and align around that vision.

### 44 Signs You Are Becoming a “Real” PM/PO

How do you know you’re on your way to earning your PM/PO wings? What signals
progress? Your first release? Getting “certified” ? Putting together a pretty
roadmap?

No …

  1. You’ll feel like you are annoying the crap out of your team
  2. You’ll find yourself sheepishly asking for an estimate
  3. You’ll realize that estimates are worthless, but still be pressured for a “rough sense of timeframe”
  4. You’ll struggle to explain why your intuition is valid (and be right)
  5. You’ll struggle to explain why your intuition is valid (and be wrong)
  6. You’ll be pressured to ship something before it’s ready
  7. You’ll try to make something perfect when you should have shipped it months ago
  8. You’ll face the harsh reality of a usability test
  9. You’ll put together the best roadmap in the world, and get everyone to buy-in, and then everything will change in an instant
  10. You’ll forget a seemingly trivial detail that will cause a massive delay
  11. You’ll rabbit hole on a seemingly important detail that will cause a massive delay for no apparent customer value
  12. You’ll be blamed for being too solution focused
  13. You’ll be blamed for being too high level
  14. You’ll find out that a new competitor is killing it
  15. You’ll have to break crappy news to your team (often admitting that you’re to blame)
  16. You’ll be jealous about ___________ and how they do product (and be reminded of that fact because they incessently blog about it)
  17. You’ll fancy yourself as technical but be humbled daily
  18. You’ll fancy yourself as UX-savvy but be humbled daily
  19. You’ll fancy yourself as business-savvy but be humbled daily
  20. You’ll say “my team”, but feel oddly distant from your team
  21. You’ll be worried about “distracting” your team, and find yourself not being transparent. And this will come back to haunt you
  22. You’ll find yourself parroting something engineers told you, and realize just how little you understand
  23. You’ll be asked to make your backlog / roadmap more visible, but then be derided when you shift things around
  24. You’ll have a day filled with meetings, and realize you added absolutely no value
  25. You’ll run a great meeting, and no one will notice
  26. You’ll work up a full-fledged wireframe, and then try to tell your UX team member that you don’t have a design in mind
  27. You’ll ship a dud feature that no one uses
  28. You’ll ship an awesome feature that no one even notices
  29. You’ll have to implement an exec’s idea, and know it sucks. And then have to live through the success theater that accompanies the release of said idea
  30. You’ll try to follow up on the impact of shipped features, but get overwhelmed by the next batch
  31. You’ll want to pull your hair out listening to your team debate the technical merits of two, almost identical approaches
  32. You’ll advocate for your pet solution against an almost identical team proposed approach
  33. You’ll tell a customer “it’s on the roadmap” and hear them laugh out loud
  34. You’ll say “No” to something just to prove to yourself that you have some influence and a point of view, and then realize that doing that is stupid
  35. You’ll say “Yes” to a customer in a moment of pure delusion, and then find yourself stubbornly trying to defend a feature that only they will use
  36. You’ll hear that you are not technical enough for the role
  37. You’ll hear that you are too technical for the role, and lack the soft skills
  38. You’ll go to a conference and learn about Lean Startup, and then come back to work and realize that the word hypothesis scares the shit out of people
  39. You’ll be the single wringable neck
  40. You’ll find yourself running cover for your team
  41. You’ll find yourself cursing your team under your breath
  42. You’ll be “empowered” on paper, but find yourself taking orders
  43. You’ll catch yourself giving orders, and learn to empower your team instead
  44. You’ll think you’ve learned from your mistakes, and you’ll magically make them again (just to make sure the learning is ingrained)

…. Because being a PO/PM is hard! It’s humbling, demanding, weird, nebulous,
and ever-changing. You’re going to screw up! Accepting that is one of the
significant hurdles of becoming a _better_ PM. You’ll figure out how little
you know and how little power you have, only to be reminded that it is often
the little things that count.

The key is never to stop being humble, empathetic, and curious. Don’t be
afraid to discuss your needs and challenges with your team. Be human! And
resist the slippery slope to burnout, egotism / mini-CEOism / backlog-
ownerism, political gamesmanship, and perpetual mistrust.

Start with your own Why. What do you care about? How do you want to work with
the people around you? Answer those questions and the rest will fall into
place.

### Be the Laziest Team and Win

I often challenge teams with the following question:

_What would happen if you stopped building anything new? Just stopped? Killed
the backlogs and roadmaps? Burned it down? Acted like a stubborn mule?_

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*pFxwgQhLWn8Ns8ohpklrXg.png)

HERMANN G. SIMON — The Stubborn Mule (1881)

Try asking!

Someone is usually quick to say “we’d lose our jobs” (which is likely true
given how most orgs work), but after the nervous laughing subsides the
conversation gets interesting. Invariably, when pushed, a brave soul will come
forward and say “you know, I’m not sure things will change all that much!”

Blasphemy! Make, build, grow, get things done, check things off, and stay
busy. It’s who we are, right? There’s always room for another lawn gnome …

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*YVKxBy5UVhm_7TqtM5sBlQ.png)

Engineers are “resources” that must be “fully utilized” and kept from being
“idle”. “What would we do all day? Just sit around and refactor the code, tool
up, and knock out bugs?” Keep the line rolling …

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*pNkisQVNZtARLm9L2GcV2g.png)

1937 Ford Assembly Line

Continue the thought experiment. If you were to stop shipping new stuff,
**WHAT** would happen and **WHEN** would it happen ? Would you miss a sales
goal or growth goal? Would churn increase? Would the competition trounce you?
And **how do you know**?

Pretty quickly you will get to the crux of the matter. And often you’ll
discover that building more stuff isn’t necessarily the only way to solve the
problem.

The irony is that we disincentivize our front-line resources — often the one’s
who know best — from asking these questions. Their job descriptions don’t read
“push back on adding ANY new complexity to the product unless we have
demonstrated that the value is a massive multiple of costs.” Instead, most
organizations and individuals celebrate output over outcomes, and shipping
over validating. Try revisiting your release notes from a couple of quarters
ago? What happened? Do you even remember what you shipped?

If we have so many ideas … then some of them MUST be good.

<http://saralouhicks.com/how-we-published-our-product-roadmap-to-the-world-
using-google-sheets-as-our-cms/>

In a weird form of Parkinson’s Law, teams are invariably able to fill the
backlog with ideas that seem reasonably valuable (or at least valuable in
comparison to each other). There’s always some new magic bullet to build or
table stakes addition. Ideas are cheap. The items are stacked back to back
with little opportunity to validate outcomes delivered.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*jgAybmCcKRPL7TeOAxsU_g.png)

Why is leaving marginally validated new stuff in the product so harmful? It’s
super expensive!

Shipping new stuff creates instant debt beyond the resources consumed for the
initial build (which — while diligently estimated and obsessed over — often
comprise a small % of the overall cost). You’re in the red immediately. You’ve
got to service it, maintain it, sell it, market it, and document it. It limits
your turning radius. Take your engineering costs and multiply it by 10 (and
then charge regular interest) to get a better idea of the outcomes you must
deliver to make it all worth it.

Why would you ever want to leave those features in the product?

So try the thought experiment with your team. What would happen if the default
stance was to continuously work down debt (UX, technical, etc.), and to **test
rigorously, and in most cases kill, new idea**s? What if the rallying call was
efficacy and not efficiency or velocity? What if you encouraged people to do
the least amount of building necessary to achieve the required outcomes?

Try asking the question:

_What would happen if you were very stubborn about adding anything new?_

### 35 B2B SaaS Tips and Gentle Reminders

> The desire for safety stands against every great and noble enterprise —
Tacitus

> The second mouse gets the cheese! — Terry Pratchett

It’s a listicle kind of night. And the topic is B2B Saas!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*YrN3kttaDgOW2058NS8XVg.png)

  1. The broader the product, and the more pains it promises to address, the “easier” it will be to sell. It’s like casting a larger net, or putting on a buffet.
  2. The breadth of a product has an exponential impact on product complexity, cost to service, cost to market, cost to sell, and cost to remain agile
  3. The broader the product, and the more diverse the customer population, the harder it will be to innovate in such a way as to keep all customers happy
  4. A product that can be used to achieve a goal for savvy customers is not the same as a product that delivers that outcome to all customers
  5. Early deals/customers bought into the dream and got lots of love. Their churn and retention rates are not representative
  6. It is virtually impossible to think clearly when considering the true costs and rewards of building a feature to close a deal. But sometimes it works out
  7. Can you hire a reasonably smart 24-year-old, without a Rolodex, and have them close quality deals in 4–6 months? Test that out
  8. At some point, you’ll have a quarter that invites the skeletons out of the closet. You can soften this blow if you keep your ears to the ground and listen to the front-lines
  9. Sales indicate you’ve discovered a pain worth solving. Usage and renewal indicate that your product solves that pain
  10. No news is not good news. Welcome the feature requests, blistering feedback, and support tickets (to a point). It shows someone is taking notice
  11. Rapid growth and learning aren’t always great bedfellows. Resist the urge to lock down structures, processes, comp plans, or pricing to the point that you stop experimenting
  12. Doubling the size of your team does not make it 2x more efficient OR effective
  13. Be diligent about calculating your cost of acquisition (CAC). What was involved in closing the deal? Who was involved?
  14. Will someone take you to their next job? That’s an excellent sign
  15. In the case of a highly aspirational product, don’t be too critical of churn. Sometimes it just isn’t a great fit, and that’s OK.
  16. You can explain NPS away. But the reality remains
  17. Beware of the platform trap. Yes, you will draw in prospects who wanted everything “all in one place”. Can you deliver that better than a selection of best in breed products?
  18. Have a reason to exist beyond growing, and meeting quotas. Those are things required to realize your higher mission, not an end unto themselves
  19. Keep a tab on sales and support heroics. The goal is to make that not necessary rather than making it commonplace. Those early hires get tired!
  20. Demonstrating ROI is a product mandate, not just something you put in your sales presentations. If you aren’t producing results and outcomes, it will eventually come back to haunt you
  21. If the customer was not actively using the competitor’s product, then it’s likely that they weren’t your competitor. You didn’t displace them. The same forces (the status quo in their organization) will also challenge usage of your product
  22. Customers expect startups to innovate/expand their product. That’s part of the reason for buying. Couple that with founders selling, and you’ll have big shoes to fill down the road
  23. In many domains (e.g. analytics, AR, machine learning, mobile, etc.) you’ll get a lot of experimental budgets thrown your way. Differentiating between experimental budget and real budget can be difficult
  24. Understand why each customer purchased your product. The “real” why even if it doesn’t fit into a neat box on a spreadsheet
  25. Hopefully, using your product will inspire your customers. But if you haven’t addressed their use case lately, it may encourage them to replace you now they’ve figured out what outcomes they can drive
  26. Keep a watch out for the non-competitor who is learning from all of your mistakes, and all of your progress. Especially if they have a lot more money
  27. Low total cost of ownership (TCO) is a double-edged sword. Without skin in the game, it can be difficult to differentiate experimentation from commitment
  28. Keep things simple! It is tempting to think you’ve expanded your ability to do multiple things at once. The reality is that things are still changing quickly and that you’re likely still in learning mode (vs. execution mode)
  29. When trying to understand value, look for a benchmark purchase in the organization. How much do they spend on coffee, lunches, and onboarding their new employees?
  30. It’s almost always easier to go upmarket with a validated product than it is to target SMBs after pursuing “enterprise” sized deals
  31. Watch out for having too many cooks in the kitchen. Especially experienced cooks. You’ll have to say no to 95% of your good ideas, even if they don’t involve engineering, and that can be hard for folks who know the “right” things to do
  32. Beware of strong relationship selling. If you’re a sales ninja, it can be relatively easy to persuade someone to buy. Ask how you’ll make that customer successful, and whether you have other customers that look just like this customer
  33. The word “enterprise” is often misleading. There are plenty of companies who will pay enterprise amounts, but who don’t require an enterprise sales approach
  34. Watch for the invisible costs of your current approach, and try to anticipate when you’ll need to pay off the interest (and at what rate). Carrying technical, UX, team culture, or learning debt will eventually need to be paid off. When?
  35. Look at your marketing and messaging. If you keep waffling between multiple messages and pitches, ask yourself why that is happening. Schizophrenic product? Too broad? Broad on purpose?


# 5 Simple Questions to Drive Validated Learning

* * *

### 5 Simple Questions to Drive Validated Learning

Here is a simple model that frames product development as an effort to trigger
a change in user behavior. It is accessible and not too jargon-laden. It can
be used to describe things on the highest level — a whole business, for
example — or a specific, low-level design change.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*gsDRyfZEkjvaDzOJJTgGeA.png)

#### Whose behavior will change because of the work?

Our product development efforts target people who share some common traits and
characteristics. What are those traits and characteristics, and who are the
people that meet those traits and characteristics?

**Example:** Customer Service Reps (CSRs) at technology savvy companies and their Customers.

#### What is their current behavior?

What pattern of behavior are we hoping to change? This behavior can be
extremely specific — like a particular navigation flow or interaction — or it
can be very broad like purchasing habits, lifestyle choices, or major life
decisions. How often does it happen? How ingrained is the behavior? How does
the Target benefit from the existing behavior, or at a minimum put up with it?

**Example:** Customers currently submit cases via an online form, and then wait up to 24hrs for a reply. The CSRs currently monitor a case queue and communicate with Customers using email and on rare occasions, the phone. The VP of CS believes that opening up a direct channel will overwhelm the team and may not provide them flexibility in responding to case volume.

#### How will their behavior change?

Something will change as a result of our intervention. Will the user start or
stop doing a particular activity? Will they do something more or less often?
Will their outlook change? Will they give you more money and your competitors
less money? Will they use your impressive new search feature instead of
spending time navigating the tab structure?

**Example:** Customers will use a communication channel “in-app” that resembles a chat interface instead of using the online case submission forms. They’ll feel comfortable interacting with a rep via chat. CSRs will respond to these in-app messages as if they were virtual telephone calls (and do so immediately, personably, and directly).

#### How will we intervene?

In the example above, the behavior change actually includes the proposed
Intervention (in-app chat). The intervention might be a change in design, a
change in tactics, or a change in in packaging, messaging, or technology.
We’re mixing the pot in some way and hopefully something will happen.

**Example:** A new online home selling platform triggers a Target who previously would only sell using a broker to take on the task of selling their own house, and to fork over a fixed fee of $2,000. The Intervention is a virtual coach that adapts advice to local and regional requirements for home selling.

#### How will the new behavior benefit the user/business?

The behavior change must result in some benefit for it to “stick”. Without a
significant payoff, you’ll be hard-pressed to persuade someone to change their
mindset and habits. Big payoffs can reinforce significant behavior changes
(like paying your company a lot more money). The benefit is the return on
investment, where the _investment_ is some shift from the status quo.

**Example:** Customers will enjoy the personal touch. CSRs will deliver faster customer service without the hassle of a phone conversation. The CSR’s employer will have higher customer retention while keeping their CSR budget reasonably small.

#### Validated Learning

In the spirit of validated learning, we attempt to validate the various
assumptions — explicit and implicit — in the framework:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*YculttC5xLDY8W-9-Zyxow.png)

  * The Target exists, and can be isolated and targeted consistently
  * The Target’s current behavior exists, and can be measured and understood
  * We can change the Target’s behavior with our Intervention
  * We can measure and understand their new behavior
  * The new behavior triggers a benefit (Outcome) for the Target
  * The Target values the Outcome sufficiently to change their behavior permanently

In most cases, just validating one piece of the puzzle (the Outcome for
example) is not sufficient. You need the full picture. And it is easy to get
bogged down in the weeds — a particular intervention, for example — and lost
sight of the major benefits required to really change the ballgame.

#### Innovation

Additionally, on a high level we can also use this framework to understand the
various types of innovation. Some examples:

  * Discovering new and underserved Targets
  * Address the needs of a large Target with a small behavior change and a small, but proportionately valuable benefit
  * Address the needs of a narrow Target with a large behavior change and large benefit
  * Figure out how to create a better outcome without significantly changing someone’s behavior
  * Figure out how to trigger significant behavioral changes that result in a big benefit

Innovation changes one or more parts of the equation in new and novel ways.

* * *

And that’s that. Talk these questions over with your team, and prioritize your
product development efforts to successively validate the various parts of the
framework.


# Chasing Revenue Growth (and Hidden Costs)

I am an avid cyclist, and have also had the privilege of coaching a couple of

### Chasing Revenue Growth (and Hidden Costs)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*CngWKQyzvq75ZCfY_Ykfiw.png)

I am an avid cyclist, and have also had the privilege of coaching a couple of
talented bike racers.

One approach to assessing an athlete (not my preferred strategy) is to set a
schedule of ever-increasing training loads. The idea is that the athlete will
eventually hit the wall and that you will have established their upper bounds
for withstanding the training stress. This approach is similar to a venture
capital firm setting a ramped ladder of revenue targets. They expect some of
their portfolio companies to “hit the wall” and “crash and burn”, but that’s
just how the cookie crumbles.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*l4Y3Av-2OuhG0peWMAAaTQ.png)

The danger here — as with startups — is that a highly motivated person can
usually find a way. We are incredibly adaptable, and can push ourselves for
many, many months. Overtraining doesn’t creep up linearly. I’ve had cyclist
friends dig a hole for years before it caught up with them. The onslaught of
fatigue and poor motivation was sudden, and there was no quick fix. It didn’t
mean they were untalented cyclists. On the contrary, they tended to be the
most talented (and most motivated).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*Rq86bv2PjBdreeUw-KgjDQ.png)

<https://statumentis.wordpress.com/2014/12/01/overtraining-is-of-great-
importance-to-the-high-performance-athlete-we-need-to-gain-knowledge/>

Usually, there was some part of the formula that was a bit off. And being
truly motivated and hell-bent athletes, they just “pushed through”. The
tragedy is that some of these people quit!

To build a long term career (either amateur or professional) the athlete must
master:

  * Diet
  * Recovery
  * Mindset and psychology
  * A strong support structure
  * Event selection and specialization

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*RLfp0Mee5q2AxCDxMLmPEw.png)

<http://www.pezcyclingnews.com/latestnews/toolbox-jump-in-the-waters-great/>

These things take time and commitment to perfect. You can get “decently far”
without paying too much attention to them, but eventually, you’ll have to pay
off the debt. For growing startups, you have similar “skills”:

  * Leadership skills
  * Ability to attract and retain the best talent
  * Strong, resilient culture
  * Agility
  * Software quality and extensibility
  * Managing growing system complexity
  * Alignment and a sense of purpose
  * Product and UX savvy
  * [High customer satisfaction](https://www.saastr.com/why-i-think-saas-companies-stall-out-at-20m-arr/)

As with diet, stress management, and positive psychology, none of these things
behave in a linear fashion. You don’t get a lot of notice before the hammer
drops. When you hit that bad quarter, you won’t just be able to do first-aid.
You will spend a long time paying the price.

The alternative approach is to make these supporting skills first-class
citizens. The athlete “trains” their diet, recovery, and psychology. We extend
time horizons to ensure that the system is healthy and that they’ll be
prepared. We don’t push until we hit (and exceed) the limit, but rather creep
up on the limit paying very close attention to the warning signs.

If you’re involved in this Darwinian revenue goal game, try to assess the
fitness of your business on a deeper level. Conduct a [pre-mortem
activity](https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem) and
visualize your first crappy quarter. What happened? And what can you do about
it now? I frequently hear VCs say something like:

> Well, it’s easy to get to ___________ . Wait until they try to get from ____
to _____

The underlying assumption here is that passing these hurdles validates your
business. It may, but it doesn’t necessarily validate the full health of your
venture. The ability to right the ship will be highly constrained if you wait
for a problem to manifest. Look for those early signs!


# The Tease

Find and fix The Tease to keep your best team members

* * *

### Fix The Tease (Turning Your Org to 11)

#### Find and fix The Tease to keep your best team members

The Tease is real. And it lurks almost exclusively in some of the best
organizations.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*SlxKpmInca2alYuNow606w.png)

<http://909sickle.net/hidden/somethings-not-right>

Imagine you are so close to something great. You’ve got all of the raw
materials: the talent, the drive, and the passion. It’s right there for you to
grab. Just reach for it!

Your organization is saying all the right things. You are empowered. The
cultural manifesto is in place. People use words like “servant leadership”,
“autonomy”, “cross-functional teams”, “experiment-friendly”, and “safe to
fail”. By all measures your company “gets it”. Just reach for it!

Imagine a single black sunflower in a bed of yellow sunflowers. Or a trickle
of sewage into a pristine mountain stream. Or the person having a loud cell-
phone conversation on a quiet bus. You notice. It grates on you. In another
setting, it would be normal. But here it isn’t.

This is **The Tease**. The Tease is when you’re so close to something awesome.
All the pieces are in place. But there is a trickle of suck. There’s some
dissonance, incongruity, or poison lurking. Not enough to head for the hills,
but just enough for it to linger in the collective organizational
consciousness. It’s the dab of politics, silos, favoritism, dysfunction, or
accepted bad behavior. The fact that the organization is so excellent
otherwise causes the sting.

Somehow “everywhere has problems” is no solace. You’re a victim of your
considerable efforts elsewhere. By making 99% of things awesome, and letting
that 1% suck, you let that 1% get magnified. It’s the loud wedding guest
interrupting the nuptials at an awesome wedding. That’s what people remember …

You attract the best and the best notice The Tease. **Find and fix The
Teas**e. It won’t be easy — the fact that it persists inside an awesome
organization is the testament to its power — but you must fix it to retain
your best talent.

How do you identify The Tease? Just listen for it … you’ve probably already
heard about it. Better yet, figure out why your organization can’t “self
repair” to fix The Tease. Remove that blocker, and the rest will happen
naturally.


# Pain, Potential, and Outcomes

Eat healthy! Get in shape! All your data in one place! Faster time to market!
Stop the information overload! Uptime! Speed! Less busywork…

* * *

### Pain, Potential, and Outcomes

Eat healthy! Get in shape! All your data in one place! Faster time to market!
Stop the information overload! Uptime! Speed! Less busywork! Happier
customers! Lower churn! More with less! More revenue! Lower costs!

Can you relate? Sure. Are there thousands (maybe tens of thousands) of
startups trying to solve those pains? Yes.

It all starts with **pain** (latent, expressed, or otherwise). You won’t get
things into 2nd gear unless someone cares. And then **potential**. What you
have — your product or service — has to at least hint at the possibility of
solving that pain. And finally, an **outcome**. The product _uniquely,
affordably, and gracefully_ alleviates your pain. There’s return on
investment.

It doesn’t always go as planned.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*GJzOsXVzrYmWqw56dv19Mw.png)

  * Example. I want clean water. I don’t want crap in my water. **Pain!**
  * My goodness, the Brita water filter looks amazingly clear, crisp, and pure. **Potential!**
  * Damn, they never told me about these filters, and the charcoal, and how I’m a lazy person who can’t be bothered to clean the thing, or remember to buy the filters. **Outcome? No.**

The temptation when validating your startup is to stop at **Pain and
Potential**. Pain and potential can get you pretty far when prospects are
looking for an edge. It can feel exhilarating. You can grow quickly on pain
and potential. A pain with an alluring product offering can attract a broad
cross-section of people, especially if you’ve got a good sales team.

But at the end of the day, it’ll be the competitor that produces **Outcomes**
(and keeps costs in line with the degree of differentiation) that will win the
day. You absolutely must know whether the potential promised in your product
is delivering an outcome. I always say…

> Sales and marketing sell the pain and the potential. Product delivers on
that promise

You could broadly divide up “sales driven” and “product driven” startups by
how they approach this sequence:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*jcSUWmFgThuDbmvT9nEl9g.png)

The sales driven startup puts energy behind selling the pain and potential.
**Growth** is the first objective. After going broad and taking stock of
customer outcomes, they’ll attempt to **Focus**.

The product driven startup validates **Outcomes** first, **Focuses** based on
those learnings, and then attempts **Growth**.

The bootstrapped startup has to achieve some level of profitability early to
keep the lights on, then must chase **Outcomes** to validate their offering as
quickly as possible, and then move on to **Focus** based on that knowledge and
**Grow**.

Regardless of the approach, you’ll need to consider outcomes eventually.

Does your product _uniquely, affordably, and gracefully_ alleviates the
customer pain? Your product is not a list of features. It’s a vehicle to
create outcomes.

Feature bullets sell the product. Your product delivers the outcomes.

### Beat the Feature Factory: Run Pre-cap Design Studios

**_Recommendation:_**_ Commit to a future recap of your product development initiative, and design the slides early in the process (leaving placeholders for the actual data)_

**_Benefit:_**_ Promote a learning mindset. Balance upfront planning with unbiased retrospective. Crease a sense of team ownership and pride. Drive a shared understanding of the initiative. Promote evidence driven development, even when the current strategy is more tilted towards the “feature factory”._

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*WoqIdA9nbo-ewIdrQsB-5w.png)

### The Opportunity

I’ve always enjoyed exercises like
[premortems](http://quickbase.intuit.com/blog/make-better-decisions-by-
conducting-pre-mortems), [future backwards](http://cognitive-edge.com/methods
/the-future-backwards/), and [heaven and
hell](http://blog.agilar.org/2015/05/07/retrospectives-series-heaven-and-
hell/). These activities are great for exploring potential futures for an
initiative, and using that information to guide the plan and approach. I was
conducting a pre-mortem recently, and a senior engineer said something that
hit me like a brick:

> You know… when this is “done”, we will have moved on to the next thing. Sure
we will have shipped something, but it will be anyone’s guess whether this
actually worked. When do we answer that question? It just never seems to
happen.

I thought about this for a while. She was right.

We had done a half-dozen activities exploring catastrophic outcomes, heavenly
future states, problem definition, problem exploration, and possible
solutions. There was a “great deck” with an inspiring vision and lots of broad
context. But the reality was that her team would be cycled on to new efforts
before they had a chance to validate the expected impact. It was the epitome
of upfront planning — not adaptive planning — and that sucked.

**Those activities are great, but they are still front-loaded**. I tentatively offered the following thought exercise:

> It is three months after shipping. You may have moved on to something else,
but you’re eager to figure out if this worked and that it drove the expected
results. It’s nagging you. You’re curious. You schedule a talk to the whole
engineering team (100+ individuals) to share your learnings. What do you
present?

I figured an intermediate step would be simply committing to compare the
expected outcome to the actual outcome.

Something about this proposal clicked with the team. It had the effect of
putting a stake in the ground. It was a commitment to learning, and presenting
those learnings in public…not just when and if someone had time to “pull the
numbers”. Summary: it worked. The approach caught on and upped the whole
team’s game.

### General Outline

Below I’ve provided a basic outline for the presentation. It’s nothing fancy,
but you’d be amazed at how infrequently these types of presentations happen
unless there’s a major win to promote. Learnings are rarely celebrated, and
that is a shame.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*yHhLGZaYQBk4p9cLvhzciA.png)

### Tips:

  * Get executive buy-in for the retrospective, and schedule it early. Part of what makes this work is the excitement (and pressure) of presenting to the whole team
  * Use a [design studio](http://www.bigspaceship.com/design-studio/) approach to “design” the slides. This alone is a great exercise for driving a shared understanding of the problem to solve. Whenever possible do it with the whole team
  * Use actual numbers whenever possible, but don’t be afraid to tell good stories
  * You might need to arrange a data-foraging exercise to pull this together, but it won’t be in vain. Self-promotion alert … [you might consider Pendo](http://www.pendo.io/) (my current product) which makes it easy to pull retroactive data without manual tagging and instrumentation.
  * Iterate on the deck while the effort is in progress, but don’t rewrite history. What makes these presentations awesome is the narrative. It sets a great example for the team.
  * Encourage the team to present as a group. It will be more impactful that way

### Conclusion

Let me know how this works for you! In my experience, visual brainstorming
works. Light peer pressure works. And face-to-face sharing inspires. Give it a
try and feel free to ask any questions in the comments below.

### Complexity Is a Startup Killer. Don’t Grow Up

Complexity is a startup killer. Like a giant anchor, it slows you down until
you’ve lost the only two advantages a startup will have: speed and focus.

Complexity manifests when you target multiple [jobs-to-be-
done](https://jtbd.info/), [elephant hunt](https://bothsidesofthetable.com
/most-startups-should-be-deer-hunters-7fdecf58f4f6#.4h29ypz1l), scale up, hire
quickly, cut corners, and implement too many “good ideas” (which seem to ooze
from every pore). The impact is exponential as you add more fuel (people,
experienced people in particular) to the fire. Before you know it, no one
knows what’s going on.

We’re not talking an [autonomous ant
colony](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/7677/20140530/ants-have-a-more-
complex-network-than-google.htm) here. Nor are we talking about a Company like
Spotify or Intuit with its dozens of pod-like
[squads](https://rctom.hbs.org/submission/the-spotify-squad-how-to-
successfully-lead-a-global-organization-without-an-operations-team/), guilds,
and colleges. When you’re further along in your business — or have evolved
since the mid-Cretaceous period — you can start to divide and conquer. With a
startup, you are none of those things. You’re still building, measuring, and
learning. Anything that constrains that is an antipattern.

**Brazil **(1985) — Director: Terry Gilliam

The problem here is that complexity is incredibly tempting to add! Let
features reproduce. Get the contract management tool. Scale up sales. Close
the deal. Pitch the next product enhancement. Add more people to your board.
Find partnerships. Say Yes. Hire “experienced” people (in quotes because
Company experience doesn’t equate to Startup experience). We’re eager, and
there are a full 24hrs in the day. And you’ve always got those “good ideas”…

In creeps the complexity like a thick fog over the Sunset District. But the
fog almost never clears. Once you’ve gone down the rabbit hole, it is nearly
impossible to come back up for air.

stores-unreliable-transit-and-oppressive-fog/>

Startups always flirt with a chaotic, existential breakdown. You’re on the
precipice, even if you don’t know it. Complexity is a safety blanket. It feels
and smells like momentum. The opposite — keeping it raw and focused — is scary
as shit. And it looks nothing like Company work.

But you NEED to fight to resist complexity, even if it freaks you out. Not in
the problem space — for sure, chase after complex challenges — but in the
execution and organizational space. Keep things so small, nimble, and simple
that it causes you near term pain (imagine you’re smelling your favorite dish
in the world and have to walk away). Don’t be a mini version of a Company.
You’ll have plenty of time to grow up.

# Startups: Be Awesome At Something

Quick post to get back in the swing of things after a much needed vacation.

### Startups: Be Awesome At Something

Quick post to get back in the swing of things after a much needed vacation.

When I talk to startup product development teams, I listen carefully for
people saying things like:

  * We’re real __________________ nerds
  * We are experts at __________________
  * We live and breath __________________
  * Our team’s secret weapon is __________________
  * We consistently find a way to __________________
  * At the core, we’re here today because __________________

If I hear people provide specific, non-plastic responses, my ears perk up.

Luck, first-mover advantage, funding, and connections can get you pretty far.
But to win (and continue winning) you need to be awesome at _something. _That
something can be a variety of things—networking, raising money,
technical/ux/product chops, knowledge of a certain buyer pain, marketing
creativity, etc. — but it **needs to be repeatable and intentional.**

Startups often fall into these traps:

  * They’re **scattered**: they want_ _to be awesome at everything
  * They’re **conflicted**: they try to be awesome at things which are in direct opposition
  * They’re **delusional**: they make bold, aspirational claims about things that they aren’t, frankly, awesome at
  * They’re **myopic**: they make big bets on being awesome at things that don’t really matter, and don’t give them an edge
  * They’re **self-conscious**: they don’t want to admit what they’re actually good at because it isn’t sexy, “cutting edge”, etc.

These traps lead you down a slippery slope: ignoring and failing to double
down on what you’re actually good at and failing to become awesome at what you
need to be awesome at.

So, take a moment to answer:

What must we be awesome at?

What are we awesome at?


# 10 Things I Learned By Doodling For 100 Days Straight

### 10 Things I Learned By Doodling For 100 Days Straight

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*7ocOOfbnr1J8vMTQTWUL5w.jpeg)

I recently finished a 100 day doodle challenge. How did it go?

### The Rules

I set a small number of rules.

  * One drawing a day for 100 consecutive days. No skipping
  * Share the drawing on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cutlegram/) and Facebook
  * No erasing, start-overs, tear-outs, whiteout
  * Don’t overthink. Start drawing within 60 seconds of opening pad
  * Black and red pen
  * In one sitting

### What I learned …

  1. I spent 100hrs+ “meditating” with a pen. That’s a win. No screens! No typing! No devices! The careful line-work in particular was very calming
  2. Overall my mood and outlook improved
  3. Peer pressure works! Once my friends started chiming in on Facebook I wasn’t turning back. On a couple occasions my challenge inspired others to take the plunge. That was very rewarding and inspiring
  4. The workweek saps your creative energy. It’s hard to focus when you’re stressed. Stress would increase as the week progressed, and the drawings would become increasingly scattered. On Saturday, the relaxation kicked in. I kept thinking … what would it take to make every day like Saturday? And was my work suffering from the same lack of lateral thinking?
  5. Ritual matters. 90% of my drawings were completed at the same coffee place (Raleigh Raw), drinking the same coffee (bullet coffee with grass-fed butter), and having the same smoothie (blueberry). It took 10 days or so to get in the swing of things. And maybe 30 to make it a habit. I’m pretty sure the caffeine injection / timing played some part in this
  6. Tools inspire. Having a good set of pens and a pen bag was a big part of the experience. I have a pen fetish now
  7. It takes practice to turn off your inner critic. Social sharing boosts the need to “make it cool”. Some of the best drawings started with no censorship and forethought. I had to consciously block out the inevitable share and looking for likes and comments.
  8. When you do something every day, it’s ok if it sucks! You have another shot. If it’s your only shot, you’re more prone to freak yourself out
  9. Some days you’ll want to get serious and meaningful. Other days you’ll shoot for trite and flippant. That’s ok! When you have output, you wait patiently for the “good ones”
  10. Constraints help. Limiting myself to mostly black pen let me practice and explore what was possible

### The Drawings (In Order)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*B--5H0shvLDpBgP4fIMsig.jpeg)

**1:100** This wasn’t too much of a stretch. I draw mind-maps all day. So it was no surprise that I started off in familiar territory.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*ZG0aC2GMPkGHYmFtg2jTkA.jpeg)

**2: 100** He sure looks scared. And of course there’s the wing-suit which must be a reference to one of my favorite films …. [Brazil](http://cinearchive.org/post/37275277565/behind-the-scenes-of-brazil-rob-heddens). Tiny dots make their first appearance, but overall I haven’t found my groove yet.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*Fc_I68qYbqPbhf22ZW1t9A.jpeg)

**3:100** Adele! Hello it’s me. Themes of isolation, rain, birds, flying, and tall places predominate. Plus I’m still using words.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*HJF8yfYrqq9yiC6nWaoHfw.jpeg)

**4:100** What a smarty pants! Actually, this did start with me imagining the sensation of a rose petals on my eyeballs. This one made me happy. And it was deliberate to some degree so it didn’t feel completely accidental.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*JtxUeP5T0WLB6zYUemXoag.jpeg)

**5:100** Wordplay continues. I was high from the rose colored glasses, so I took another shot at something witty. At this point I was all in. I had shared the drawings on Facebook. Game on. But it didn’t have the zing of the glasses.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*uaynzIDmsINU9fAEI6i5lA.jpeg)

**6:100** Major discovery! Starbucks can completely **** me up. My hands were shaking and it felt like lasers were shooting out of my eyeballs. So I drew that.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*if4HcX4e4c79a7ZEWsJx3w.jpeg)

**7:100 **OK. Things get serious. I remember what NYC looked like shortly after 9/11. I remember all the posters taped up on construction site walls. It was heart breaking. But I have to admit … I questioned whether I was just milking this memory for the drawing. Have you ever had that happen?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*9TxcsuqWNbEfLoskjJ1K2Q.jpeg)

**8:100 **My first of the the weird “the people are kind of small and the object is super big” drawings. I also discovered how to draw sand. The father and son walking away held some significance for me. This was the first drawing where I stated to get super anal with the line-work.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*mbnXWajVyFjcprnP6FTRCg.jpeg)

**9:100** Strange how this happens. Back to back small people (see 8:100). This started as an insect, but I wasn’t happy with it. It didn’t look “right”. So at the last minute I turned it into a kite. I was traveling at the time, so I was likely caffeinated with Starbucks coffee (bad ideas), and my head wasn’t in the game.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*d7nkFjknbDDZUiZXsKHuDQ.jpeg)

**10:100** OK! Now we’re in business. The addiction with line-work, different textures, rain clouds, and awkward perspective gazebos begins. I actually finished this at an Agile conference in King of Prussia (of all places). My mind must have been pretty dialed in. I start to notice the fetish of carrying around nice pens.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*9ZT_5IDV8_wf5WMhEd0iyA.jpeg)

**11:100** Travel day. This felt like weak sauce. It can be hard to string together super-anal line-work on back to back days.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*B40m54uvwHS3pz32gsZ_7A.jpeg)

**12:100** Strange swirls and flourishes rise! This was one of those wandering “I won’t know until it is almost done” doodles. I go to my old standby little-people (see above) and it comes to life. I loved the idea of a strange ferris / hamster wheel. The buttocks in the lower left was unintentional.

**13:100 **13 was not lucky to me. I get lost in the swirls. This was probably a stressful day.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*HzeiApIAees2Y1OKmwjNJA.jpeg)

**14:100** Birds! Rain! Sand! Themes unite. My favorite part of this drawing was doing the clouds. I didn’t expect it to work. But in retrospect they look very layered and humid.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*6ARbbymz7rHpNlcheuAnLQ.jpeg)

**15:100** I patted myself on the back a bunch of times for this one. Anal line-work? Check. Word-play? Check. My friend Tim counted them to make sure I did include 50 shades. I did. Pulling this off made my day. I haven’t seen the movie. Is it good?

**16:100** Return of the crazy gazebo and little people. There’s some movement here … they’re climbing to the top. What’s at the top? I don’t know. Remember the rocks. I come back to them near the end.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*X2yZEC2corhF1L7NuiwG0w.jpeg)

**17:100** Stressful morning. I couldn’t get my head in the game here, and work was looming on my mind. Stress muffles the thoughts and saps the patience.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*33Tjjo3ZDwnAn6af5RLN6Q.jpeg)

**18:100** Regaining some momentum I tap into my childhood obsession with catfish. I considered the return to halfway focused and inspired drawing a win here (given the previous day’s doodle crap).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*hlAMmUgz8AfuTHejk-SHGQ.jpeg)

**19:100** Is it a house? A hotel? How about a weird house with stairs? You can see the lines become tighter here. Dots. A wild freeform splat. These themes will return in future drawings.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*vUAuOSIG_7xxAHkKG1fuiA.jpeg)

**20:100** And now for something completely different! I was getting bored with the semi-literal stuff. The idea of parallel lines seemed appealing.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*xVJv7ys8XoLiAr2sUJ3e6g.jpeg)

**21:100** I channel a bracelet designer and go for symmetry.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*e8CyYxepDYqpg21E2Dtz5Q.jpeg)

**22:100** This followed the pattern of “ok, let’s draw a bunch of patterns and then position a person in the drawing”. Webs, roses, thorns. Some familiar themes and a more confident larger non-stick-figure.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*hTxzLxXcBYcir6XZLP7xbA.jpeg)

**24:100** A crying elephant in a hall of mirrors with a nude. Makes perfect sense. I came to the elephant about halfway through the doodle.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*j-eKs6lCL-vO5_yt3S-QEQ.jpeg)

**25:100** A lapse. My mind wasn’t in it and work was piling up the stress. I try to resurrect it a couple ways, but it will be the flying steak forever.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*85ZHhYr_71q417334KVD8w.jpeg)

**26:100** Patterns and doodles. Some new techniques … little circles, network drawings, a stray bra, and booze.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*FRRsFge9RL7Pe_XylHTjbQ.jpeg)

**27:100** More structure and control. For a while I was thinking about making it a woman’s back. Maybe it is. But I resort to a small man on a bicycle underneath a bunch of balloons.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*0YBx6oibaOvmVXdkJBhL2g.jpeg)

**28:100** End of the workweek! Can’t hold it together. Fridays aren’t great doodle days. Note that I repeated #27. This is #28.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*xclfDW286NMtb7OF0DPgoA.jpeg)

**29:100** Ah! Saturdays. Time to be incredibly detailed. The steps descend.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*kn8TCRXX1cjedaj1OxHa-Q.jpeg)

**30:100** First of the knife drawings. And sexual fruit.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*sj6hF85F5GbGUMSMIJbMBg.jpeg)

**31:100** Must be a Monday. Semi-relaxed but mind buzzing. The squares return in a tree drawing later.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*_ZglrrcF4o-kswK-FInAHw.jpeg)

**32:100** This was more playful with larger circles. On some level it is related to the prior day’s drawing, but I go big.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*CmoSA9fYoE5igR-5SK9R-g.jpeg)

**33:100** Intriguing. I was thinking about turning 41 years old apparently.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*FsejIeXQCy2_IyIiJhrJ_A.jpeg)

**34:100** More knives, fruit, and sex. Replete with a bra and a serpent. What was going on?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*wzuXfCFbQh-Vci_mQdcRkg.jpeg)

**35:100** I return to the blocky tree (see 11:100), and scaling extremes (little house or person). But there’s a balance here I like.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*ODZZK5IoA2dw6h8aDASpHA.jpeg)

**36:100** And now for a different tree! This was a good recovery from the prior day. Weekend work for sure.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*aWnQ8JCLI_9ZCVVHQr_V-w.jpeg)

**37:100 **Robot insect. With crown (or something). I return to this a bit later.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*_pnz4VGV0fyTBcnxgtRR1A.jpeg)

**38:100** I really loved this. The bullet coffee actually works. I was in the zone for a while. It was like meditating. I discovered that messy dot work can be effective for contouring things.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*MQ9gAMf7bNnuuv6N4zJsSQ.jpeg)

**39:100** And I lose it! After the joy of the prior day’s work — probably early in the work week — I lose focus. The fish is nice though.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*XYFy7IsaH7KXMOHojboFHA.jpeg)

**40:100** Light nudity. Lizards. Bikes. Excel cell references. Octopus. Just another day I guess. This fits in the “lots of boxes / circles with little things mixed in” theme.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*NTI-xlR6fwLdzJ8FhbK4bQ.jpeg)

**41:100** This was the first of the “matchstick” type drawings.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*qeb2EGTE_tZZUGjp7mGfBw.jpeg)

**42:100** And … with the Cat Save! When in doubt make it a monitor and include a cat. Totally makes sense.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*0I5hFAlYw7Qbi_lmjvZ1Sg.jpeg)

**43:100** I was looking at Weather Underground and noticed the wind markers. That seemed like a cool thing to obsessively draw over and over. But I wanted to take a risk … on something “Real”. So I drew an arm and didn’t destroy it. See later for the Sperm Tree. I avoided that effect here.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*-NdJI9xno_wRLsZg-CGeGw.jpeg)

**44:100** Color by numbers?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*OqxTSqjVUxn7n3Uni2AUJA.jpeg)

**45:100** Bolstered by my confidence drawing “people”, I tried to sprinkle some people in. Like Nigel Tufnell. And boys. But I’m most proud of the globs on globs.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*IUw7EDXhnnzGs81oKGwL6g.jpeg)

**46:100** Self-portrait. I was in a pretty angst mood that day. I was coming up with a ton of ideas … but all the ideas freaked me out.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*fYJ0j7LAGJW_iY2sUbMjBQ.jpeg)

**47:100** And the hill slopes up to the right! There are birds and rocks. And patterns. And network drawings. Some classic themes with good line-work.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*WnMu9CrUquS6sWHSUcyFBQ.jpeg)

**48:100** Why don’t we keep on this network drawing kick? Sure! It even looks like an animal. See later for the nude with tiny networks.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*6kIqGpTnj456a6-tiy_2-A.jpeg)

**49:100** Weird hotel on a hill. Knives. Patterns!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*9JSDGbvnWJccYcoZpMAo-Q.jpeg)

**50:100** Bolstered by my new pen purchases, I go completely ape-shit. There’s blood. And bones. And feathers.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*hAAJSlEdALNl30mnNFAr-Q.jpeg)

**51:100** These pens are great. Seriously, good tools — and having 50 drawings under my belt — made this a ton of fun. The dots, crosshatch, etc.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*p6-feDn9O-jFRqK9uo_EgA.jpeg)

**52:100** I go deep. This started as a network drawing. Incredibly detailed. But it started to take the form of a woman. I was excited. Did the red mess it up?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*qorGMgXldyaggnSUZDp3uA.jpeg)

**53:100** Maybe it is fatigue, but I return to something less arduous. I’m pretty sure this was a Monday. After the weekend of new pens and meditation, I go for something less busy.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*Twsz3o5dQvg8kJX7W3BgGg.jpeg)

**54:100** As strange as it sounds, the “messy” branches on the upper left were a major win for me. I was really in the line-mode, and broke out of it with some happiness-producing results.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*EjVTft8sKIwPA9RtmIl0Ug.jpeg)

**55:100 **Tunnels? More and more lines, but the “fuzziness” on the tubing was pleasing. It felt less linear.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*L0hj9FLKZltqAMLSfc63hg.jpeg)

**56:100** Black Lives Matter news. I kept thinking about a person trying to scream, but nothing coming out.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*OgPgCHDaR00SJGdHJ6Jp_Q.jpeg)

**57:100** And then follow that up with a completely unrelated sperm tree. I really didn’t want this to be the sperm tree. I doodled and doodled, and kept hoping it wouldn’t look like a sperm tree. But it ended up that way.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*0MgbgKBU_BDn-AjqNSgSZQ.jpeg)

**58:100** Shit! That was super lucky. A whale! A real whale. Once the form took shape, I found it hard to turn back. I learned with this drawing that you could also use light pen pressure for the line work. It was more like shading.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*No4jdMvKHrs7CzSMZzxmXw.jpeg)

**59:100** Weekday distraction. Oh well, it must be a vein. Let’s draw arrows to show the disease creeping in.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*rL1Pym_MCEk0bw0YkIFdUQ.jpeg)

**60:100** Feeling toxic. Like only bullshit is leaving my mouth! Self-portrait again.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*FjImOU3csUVvfNQ-K9QvvA.jpeg)

**61:100 **One of those days!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*duN7Eu6qaBRY1RuX19VAAQ.jpeg)

**62:100** Thicker lines. Petals. Layers. A good reprieve from the day before.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*1GoYDwQThgPDw6xSKhTkNA.jpeg)

**63:100** And we’re back to little gazebos and walkways. Phew.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*Womarhf97Le9lJhPJYtc0A.jpeg)

**64:100** Lest we forget trees, little people, fruit, and all of that good stuff.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*Kns4FvCapcvkuhLRI2cnGQ.jpeg)

**65:100** Today let’s draw a ton of squares! So I did. There was something challenging about drawing little squares, and not circles.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*TxVSz4T31PIcl8kT1X_9Pg.jpeg)

**66:100** Let’s get angular! And draw lines. This is an oft repeated theme, but I went full screen for this picture.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*hpnaG-YVg5O_O3FkcfdjVA.jpeg)

**67:100** Non-distinct. Mid week. I finished this at 11:30PM.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*ZoxgRwrwl36UzX4TJtTt1w.jpeg)

**68:100** Little critters! In retrospect I didn’t like the fact that the critters were trapped by the tree. Looks uncomfortable.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*S_CQfZZ-V_tJqYUVQBhiDg.jpeg)

**69:100** No guilt! There was a creative malfunction here. So instead of just phoning it in, I called it out.

**71:100** Hurray for the weekend! Calm. Serenity. A tiny person, rain, and a tree. But seriously, I enjoyed the layering of the clouds on this one, and the obsessive square drawing. Win! Confidence regained.

### Agile: Don’t Exchange Waterfalls for Whirlpools

This is a **waterfall**:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*gD-WKbjHO5xMrfxmnUz4pQ.png)

In the Agile product development world, waterfalls are **bad**. The idea was
to get away from things that look like **this**:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*5W0GLhXeSlHADiINxAABdQ.png)

… and move to something that looks more like ocean waves:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*eo0RvfGL37fEJcHvowifRg.png)

<http://scrumreferencecard.com/scrum-reference-card/>

It actually works. Faster! Better! More flexible! Less rework! Less waste!
What’s not to like? The business will change its mind all the time (those
crazy suits) and you’ll just do some Agile kungfu on it. Scrum CHOP!

The problem is that Agile (as commonly implemented) often feels like a
whirlpool. Without tending to the human side — diversity, safety, and
celebrating meaningful results — it becomes a treadmill. It’s a constant slog
of monotonous rituals and meandering iterative development… like adding globs
of wet sand to a sand sculpture at the beach. ‘Round and ‘round you go …
introspecting in a hall of retrospective mirrors:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*1VGTPTZOeBtA77_s5Av7sA.png)

Retros. Planning. Backlog grooming. Acceptance criteria. Standup. Rinse
repeat.

Without a focus on outcomes and results, you’re stuck on a feature factory
treadmill. And you know what? Experienced people hate that. Crap made fast is
still crap. They check out. Once you’ve graduated out of the pure bliss of
releasing production-ready code, you start to wonder if anyone is using these
“stories”. Is it working? Did you [eventually build the

Have you checked out the This American Life episode on the GM Nummi plant? If
not, do so [here](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-
archives/episode/561/nummi-2015). What I found most interesting about this
story is that GM couldn’t replicate the Nummi success in other plants. The
original team — faced with an impending plant closure — visited Japan and had
a transformative experience. They were empowered to save their plant and
experienced amazing success. In other plants, that wasn’t the case. Those
efforts failed.

> Before, when GM ran this place, I dreaded coming to the plant. Management
was always screaming and hollering. Now it is so different! I look forward to
getting here and helping my team solve problems.

Humans enjoy the ebb and flow! They like ambitious visions and a challenge. We
enjoy stories with a beginning, middle, and end. We like making a difference!

But Daniel eventually goes on to compete against the brutal Cobra Kai. There’s
a story arc there.

All of that stuff you want: the scale, the growth , the speed, the quality,
the control, the accountability, the predictability, the … agility is
achievable **without safety, diversity, and learning (**at least for a short
period of time)**.** If you’re a big org and feel like some paint-by-numbers
just [implement SAFe](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/).

To get to a higher level you’ll eventually need the empathy, inspiration,
creativity, humanity, and novelty:

# Maybe You’re Just Bored. And It’s Your Fault

It’s not the boss, the strategy, or the system. You’re just not in the right
place and/or doing the right thing. And it’s your fault.

* * *

### Maybe You’re Just Bored. And It’s Your Fault

#### It’s not the boss, the strategy, or the system. You’re just not in the
right place and/or doing the right thing. And it’s your fault.

I speak from experience.

#### Sound Familiar?

I’m 41. I like big challenges, missions, and asking why. I get bored easily
when I can’t tackle those things.

I like rigor. I work hard and my work is considered valuable and high
leverage. I don’t navigate internal politics well. I tease out of the root
cause quickly. I want to fix those problems. I’ve been called the “canary in
the coal-mine” multiple times. I’m impatient, stubborn, and lack tact. I
relate to the front-line doers and like flat organizations. I believe most
managers are just getting in the way.

That’s me, for better or worse.

It’s taken a while to **accept that many work situations left me bored and
under-stimulated. That was a big step. Without that self-awareness I
frequently sought stimulation by trying to fix the situation. **And we know
how that goes … established systems are a beast, you get burnt out, leave, and
it all starts over.

#### My Advice …

A friend in their mid-twenties sent me an email recently asking for advice. I
saw a lot of me in him: hunger, sensitivity, drive, confidence mixed with
insecurity, systems thinking, and the drive for a “better way”. I replied with
this …

> It’s your responsibility, and your responsibility alone, to seek out (or
create) the environments where you can thrive. Your weaknesses shape your
strengths. Without them you’d not be who you are. You could spend decades
trying to be something you aren’t, or invest the time now being who you are.

> My biggest “mistake” was not building a foundation earlier. Chipping away
earlier. Accepting earlier. I was my own worst enemy for a long time.

> Maybe you’re a better consultant! Maybe you should start a company! Maybe
you need a better mission, or a better cause! Maybe you need to hang out with
different people. Maybe people should pay you to be exactly who you are, warts
and all? Do what it takes. You might even need to shut up and do the grunt
work for a couple years (but keep the end-goal in mind).

> Most importantly, start writing your own narrative. Because it will take a
while. And wont be easy.

The next time you find yourself angst-ridden about your work … ask if you’re
just under-stimulated. Are you bored? And why are you allowing that to be the
case? How are you getting that fixed?


# Do We Need Product Managers?

### Do We Need Product Managers?

#### _After reading the 745th blog post trying to define product management
and product ownership …._

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*eDIjzk_g9KqqVw_hreIjFA.png)

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uihgdgGBLKk>

Yeah. I know. It depends. But …

To build a successful product you _do need _context, business savvy, domain
knowledge, vision, customer empathy, technical prowess, communication skills,
and [insert skill/hat here]. You need lots of hats:

But you don’t necessarily need Product Managers and/or Product Owners (people
with those titles).

Businesses talk frequently about owning, single wringable necks and
accountability. Someone needs to give the status update. Someone needs the
visibility. Someone needs to be presentable enough to attend The Business
(capitalized) meetings. The Business needs these things. Do they contribute to
building a valuable product? That’s debateable. In addressing those needs,
organizations often propagate anti-patterns that cause deep, lasting harm.

At conference after conference I hear about “bad product managers” and
“incapable product owners”. I’ve heard product owner jokes in keynote talks.
I’ve participated in multiple ad-hoc 5 Why exercises with strangers that
identify product management as the root cause. Is it really that bad? I don’t
think so. It’s safe to say that something else is going on. All of these well
meaning people can’t suck so bad (although consultants would love for you to
believe otherwise).

I think that the problem is 1) the pipe-dream, and 2) structuring the org
around dysfunction. Time traveling to 2008, [here’s a description of the
product owner role](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/product-
owner):

> Part of the product owner responsibilities is to have a vision of what he or
she wishes to build, and convey that vision to the scrum team. This is key to
successfully starting any agile software development project.

> The product owner is commonly a lead user of the system or someone from
marketing, product management or anyone with a solid understanding of users,
the market place, the competition and of future trends for the domain or type
of system being developed.

Wow. That sounds awesome. This superhero will figure it all out for us, and
we’ll be off to the races. We’ll have someone to blame if there is no vision.
They’ll know what to build, and we’ll build it. So we dutifully assign these
people to 6–12 engineers, regardless of whether those 6–12 engineers build a
singular product, and hope for the best.

A CTO (who prides himself on being “Agile”) recently told me:

> Well John, you know that all engineers secretly want to be told what to
build. We like to build. We don’t want to waste our time in meetings

In addition to this being patently false — many engineers I know very much
care about impact — we know this approach fails. We know we’re wrong often. At
a minimum we know we’re rarely 100% right when we first ship something. And
time is a cruel mistress. But the pipe-dream exists.

The reality is that most product managers are overworked, spread too thin, and
under-empowered. They’re the go-between. What people recognize as “bad product
management” can almost always be traced back to deeper organizational
challenges. These challenges manifest in the connective tissue of the
organization (the product team). Product makes for a convenient scapegoat.

Every PM can relate to that awkward moment when someone with “C” in their name
is helicopter managing the product, while at the same time the team is beating
them up for changing priorities. That’s not a recipe for attracting and
retaining the best.

I often hear about the benefits of “creative tension” between the Product,
Engineering, and Sales organizations. To which I respond with something like:

> Why do you insist on silo-ing the product and engineering teams? Is
engineering just a factory in your mind? How do you actually benefit from this
tension? More importantly, what do your customers think about all of these
coordination meetings? Why not a single product development organization?

Some organizations have taken the bold step of a single product development
organization, but this is pretty rare. Toyota had the famed chief engineer
role, [a staple of the value-stream oriented lean product development
model](http://www.lean.org/shook/DisplayObject.cfm?o=906). But the reality
remains: most organizations are structured around their needs (and
dysfunctions), and not the needs of the customer. They create product roles
because “that’s what people do” instead of asking “what must we do for our
customers”. The org becomes fatter, taller, less skilled, less resilient, less
adaptable, and more complex to navigate.

You start optimizing around your company structure, and not what people
actually need.

### Probing Questions

Start by asking yourself some questions …

  1. Do your PMs own outcomes or the delivery of features? If the delivery of features, why not just hire skilled project managers?
  2. By hiring the single PM, are you failing to provide other much needed pieces of context to your teams? Are your PMs skilled at ________ ?
  3. Why does every group of 6 or 12 engineers and UX need a product owner? Is that team exclusively responsible for an actual product? If they controlled the budget would they actually hire the PO full-time? Or would they put a rec out for other, more specific needs (e.g. “attend meeting X and let us know if there are changes”)
  4. What do your teams need? What do your customers need? What % of your PM’s day is actually benefitting the customer vs. the internal needs of your organization? Why?
  5. How do your product managers insulate your engineering teams? How could you eliminate the need to “protect the teams from __________” ?
  6. Could you afford fewer, but more highly skilled product managers and product owners? Even if they had larger teams?
  7. Are there more effective ways to deliver status checks?
  8. Why do you need separate Product org and Engineering orgs? How does the customer benefit?
  9. Could you rotate the PO role? Are there other folks in the organization who can supply the context, thereby cutting out the noise / signal loss? Do your needs remain constant? If not, can your PMs/POs remain that adaptable? Or do you expect them to just bail?
  10. Are your most skilled product managers/owners working on the front lines?
  11. Are your expectations for your product team reasonable? Is there enough time in the day to actually do the work adequately?
  12. Can you bring the silos of your organization closer together? Such that the overhead of coordination would drop and benefit your customers? And what would that do to your product team?

So yeah. Sometimes you’ll end up with the someone with the Product Manager or
Product Owner title. But sometimes you wont. Before you write that job ad,
consider what you need and/or what you need to do to make that person
successful.


# Explaining Product/Market Fit in 60 Seconds

Your product shows potential. But does it perform?

* * *

### Explaining Product/Market Fit in 60 Seconds

#### Your product shows potential. But does it perform?

Product/market fit is a slippery term. I think of it as follows (3Ps):

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*Q4ql8AqNvIIuGpKgDicMjw.png)

#### Pain

You’ve validated a **pain** exists and an identifiable group of people are
willing to fork over cash to see that problem fixed

#### Potential

Your product shows **potential. **That group of people want to give your
product a shot. They’re willing to engage with your product/organization in
the hopes that it will solve their pain.

#### Performance

Your product **performs**. It actually solves / alleviates the pain. It
produces valuable outcomes and _continues_ to produce valuable outcomes month
after month, year after year. You continue to innovate on your solution to the
problem/**pain**, and realize the **potential**.

This is why Product/market fit is fluid and hard to pin down, especially when
you’re tackling ubiquitous problems.

  1. **Pain **is relatively easy. Most pains are known (though some discover pains we didn’t even know we had).
  2. With some work, teams can develop products that show **potential**. It’s harder, but doable. The deeper the pain, the more people are willing to take chances on things with potential. Especially in tech, a lot of companies are throwing around money just to try things out.
  3. **Performance** is where things get tough. The rubber hits the road.

The danger is **mistaking pain and potential for performance**. Pain and
potential can get you reasonably far, certainly past a couple rounds of
funding. But it all eventually boils down to performance. Large swaths of
startup technology hasn’t advanced beyond the potential phase. Which is OK —
there might be a huge upside — but it is what it is.

The lesson: **differentiate product potential from product performance** when
talking about Product Market Fit.

### 16 Quick Product Management Tips

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*RhRgIrTBI3EdGZiz6AYNRw.png)

PM work isn’t easy ….

Some quick coffee fueled snippets from a product coaching email exchange …

#### Consider the following …

  1. Approach all PM advice with some skepticism. What is the context? What is the product? What is the product stage? Who is the customer?
  2. Senior engineers care deeply about the impact of their work, and check out when they don’t sense that impact. Being a cog in a feature-factory is no fun. Address that or risk losing your best
  3. Batch your planning and approach it “just in time”. The floors of companies are littered with planning in progress. You can plan 6 months of work in 60 minutes, so why do it ahead of time?
  4. Be proactive about giving the team slack to work down debt. Let them know you’re open to that discussion
  5. There’s a spectrum of actionable context. More experience = greater ability to act on (and reject) data, context, and details. Junior folks wont have that skill (yet). Point is … respect the need for more context as it gives your best team members the information they need to solve the problem. For junior team members respect that they’re constantly upping their game. Explain how you’re connecting the dots …
  6. Leave time to iterate. This is frequently given lip service. “Well, we’ll watch for things and then — while you’re building this new widget — we’ll work it in.” This never (or rarely) happens … and 2 years later, when the context is lost, doesn’t count
  7. Cultivate a meaningful ebb and flow. Iterative development can suck the life out of a team. People like challenges and missions
  8. Respect the dynamic. Writing production-quality code and designing production-quality user experiences is extremely demanding. There are “passing tests” (usability tests included). As a PM, do you have passing tests?
  9. Become a master of driving a shared understanding. But realize that meetings are one of many ways to achieve that (and often the least effective). Visualize things. Record things. Repeat things, in person
  10. Creative work requires downtime. What defines productivity in your world (keyboard tapping) doesn’t equal productivity in the UX and Engineering world
  11. If the “best ideas win” then make sure that everyone has a fair shot at offering ideas. The reality is that your ideas aren’t always the best ideas. More importantly, cultivate a deep understanding of the problem, or commit to learn more about the problem. The good ideas will flow
  12. Quantify the status quo. Too many teams dream up success metrics with no baseline. What is the customer’s current behavior? Later, check to see if your work impacted this behavior
  13. “Leftover” work and design/research don’t work well with each other. It’s two different mindsets. Don’t do six 1hr research activities spread over a week while you tie up loose ends. Finish A, and then start B with two days of focused work. That “staggered sprint” thing or “getting ahead of the sprint” … just not a fan. All efficiencies disappear despite it making sense on paper
  14. It’s tempting to force convergence (“we need the mockups now!”). The best ideas emerge after an almost uncomfortable level of divergence. Protect this, even if it feels messy
  15. You have to be willing to throw code away and start over. As a PM its easy to rationalize otherwise.
  16. It’s important to differentiate between linear and non-linear impacts in product development. You can’t scale certain things 2x and expect other things to scale 2x (e.g. # of personas and size of team required to serve those personas)

OK. Back to coffee and [some doodling](https://medium.com/personal-

### Why Startups Need 3rd Party Accountability Coaches

As a startup founder you’ll get a lot of advice and feedback. Everyone has
opinions. Everyone wants you to avoid pitfall X,Y, and Z. Your board, your
employees, your fellow founders, and your customers will all have something to
say. The advice is often conflicting and deafening.

More advice doesn’t equal more clarity and at its worst (e.g. board advice) it
forces violent swings in strategy and tactics. What’s needed is unbiased
accountability. Is it working? Where’s the data? How are your experiments
going? Are you staying true to your values? Instead, you get shotgun blasts of
well-meaning but invariably biased advice.

The problem is compounded because founders exist in a cognitive bias petri
dish. It’s the achilles heel of the lean startup approach. A disciplined,
experimental approach sounds good in theory. But that all falls apart when
someone dangles money in your face, an investor mentions an off-handed
challenge, the big partner calls, or someone fluffs your ego.

So the advice is biased and you are biased … the well-meaning leading the
blind.

The irony is that most founders, at some point, were the one’s giving the good
advice and feedback. The rolls were reversed. And someone wasn’t listening.
That frustration, and the conviction to “not make these silly mistakes”, is at
the root of many startup inception stories. But like parents promising to
never repeat the sins of their parents, it’s much harder to pull off in
practice.

What you need, is someone with no skin in the game to hold you accountable.
Not an employee, not another founder, not someone on your board, and not a
friend in the business. Find that person. Write things down. Meet regularly.
Describe your strategy, pivot/proceed points, and milestones. Be disciplined
and focused. And get dispassionate advice linked to YOUR goals.

I am eternally grateful for the great work these communities and individuals
have done. My personal ROI to learn, mix, match, and apply these methods has
been amazing. Sure it looks like a buzzword soup. But that’s what learning is
all about. “Consume responsibly! Test for staining!”

If you think its easy to do research, write a book, organize conferences, give
talks, complete projects, and [ — — — — ] you are mistaken. Sure, much of it
isn’t “new” (and the curators wouldn’t claim otherwise) but the presentation
is crisp and thoughtful. In some cases — take Lean and Agile, for example —
the body of work is massive, spanning decades and tens of thousands of people.
Sure, some people want to cash in. But don’t we all, on some level?

Put bluntly, there are no shortage of ideas and perspectives to apply to your
current challenge. Perhaps too many. It is a “learner’s market” … you’ve got a
lot to work with. However ….

In most cases, organizations are not blocked because they picked the “wrong
model”. Rather, they are blocked because their organization lacks the pre-
requisites for experimentation, reflection, and continuous improvement (a
challenge addressed in many of these approaches, though often glossed over by
the reader). Or they’re truly burdened by past decisions. There’s nothing
original in this observation. We’ve all played the old salt reminding people
that there is no magic bullet. [There’s a reason why it took years for Inuit
to adopt a design thinking approach](https://hbr.org/2015/01/intuits-ceo-on-
building-a-design-driven-company).

That said, I find myself making the same mistakes repeatedly:

  * Taking too broad of a systems thinking approach. Sometimes the problem is truly local. You’ve got a toxic, power hungry, maniacal person in a position of power. And that sucks. Granted, the fact that they remain in power is the root cause, but I digress :)
  * You can’t measure someone’s passion for change by how loud/quite they are. Some people love to complain. Others are scared to speak out. Partner and form alliances with care
  * Timing. Many orgs are digging out from a mountain of ____ debt. It manifests as having product issues, but the reality is that nothing tangibly will happen in that area until they’ve worked out other issues
  * Assuming that folks feel safe to experiment and fail. An executive sponsor may be terrified at the prospect of trying X and failing on the first go round
  * Payday. Some people are just riding things out. They’re waiting to be 100% vested. They have a lot to win and gain. It doesn’t mean they approve of what’s going on, but just that they’ve come to peace with their desired outcome
  * The power of “good enough”. Because something is working moderately well doesn’t mean that 1) it will continue to work, 2) it can be improved upon without major changes. But that is difficult to explain and sometimes very difficult to refute
  * Only the “front-line” is bought in. Most of these approaches appeal to the front lines. But that doesn’t mean anyone else is paying attention. The reverse is often the case
  * Underestimating the sheer power of the status quo. It is easy to imagine it as static, instead of respecting the powerful dynamics required to keep something “stable”

> [](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/772044832747294720)

  * Not being empathetic to “change PTSD” … namely, the prior damage of poorly thought out change initiatives done under the banner of a “way”. Lots of senior execs suffer from this, and it drives their skepticism
  * The need for people to own and take credit for improvements and change. In many cases the methodology is being “hired” to give a particular team member power and influence. And sometimes we fall into that trap ourselves. I’ve dealt with people who steadfastly resisted methodology X, and then embraced X+”UX” because they owned UX
  * Lack of shared understanding. My “customer focused” is your “UX obsessed” is their “build features to close the deal”
  * Limited CIP: change in progress. The limited capacity of any system to absorb change. It wont all happen at once
  * Believing everyone thinks and learns the same way
  * Not reflecting and retro-ing on the change effort itself. Is it working? Why? Why not?

So, when mixing and matching your favorite perspectives (or implementing your
own), remember to keep this all in mind. Work first on the operating system:
cultivating an environment friendly to experimentation, reflection, and
continuous improvement. And then go to town at a sustainable pace.


# It’s All Good. Until You’re Screwed

There’s no free lunch or magic strategy.

### It’s All Good. Until You’re Screwed

There’s no free lunch or magic strategy.

Costs and risk are frequently invisible. Effects are non-linear and difficult
to predict. What makes sense now often makes no sense in the long term. We all
struggle with our biases. The sensible response proves to be irrational.

It is never easy …

  * We destroy our goals for three quarters, but end up struggling to pick up the pieces for the next two quarters
  * We pursue growth, but end up underestimating the accumulation of technical and cultural debt
  * We prevent errors, but end up overly confident that errors will be caught
  * We celebrate healthy tension, but end up with the mediocre, but less objectionable option
  * We try to keep everyone in the loop, but end up drowning in meetings and communications
  * We carefully define roles and responsibilities, but end up with too many constraints and too heavily matrixed team members
  * We design the perfect interface, but end up incapable of extending it for a new use-case
  * We hire 10x doers, but end up in need of 10x coaches and mentors
  * We seek alignment, but end up with too much momentum and process to pivot
  * We promote autonomy, but end up incapable of mustering the troops to defend against an immediate threat
  * We promote harmony, but end up having trouble with uncomfortable conversations
  * We stress individual accountability, but end up squashing team ownership
  * We chase velocity, but end up quickly shipping mediocre outcomes
  * We bail out a team, but end up limiting their ability to self-rescue in the future
  * We target more personas with our product, but end up with feature soup
  * We defeat one competitor, but end up leaving ourselves vulnerable to disruption

And that’s life. What counts is our ability to observe and respond … to
question the rational path, experiment, reflect, and repeat. What works now,
might not work tomorrow! Ask yourself: what is restricting our ability to
change course when the course is no longer smart?

Use a light touch and resist the urge to control and predict.

Cheers!

John


# PMs/POs: 25 Things You Can Try Now

What can you do in the next week or two to be a better product manager?

* * *

### PMs/POs: 25 Things You Can Try Now

#### What can you do in the next week or two to be a better product manager?

I write these listicles for friends and consulting clients and share them when
I can:

  1. Call five customers and ask them the same, non-leading questions. Share an overview with your team. Better yet, invite folks to listen in
  2. Observe five people using your product to get their daily work done. GoToMeeting is fine for this. Ask to be a fly on the wall. Edit a set of interesting clips. Share with your team
  3. Conduct a story-mapping exercise (see [Jeff Patton’s book for help](https://www.amazon.com/User-Story-Mapping-Discover-Product/dp/1491904909/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=jefpatass-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=NX2UXYQEFAANOFPO&creativeASIN=1491904909))
  4. Collaborate with your UX team to conduct a usability test _right now _for an upcoming feature (a paper prototype is fine). Do a couple tests, iterate, and repeat
  5. Watch [this video](https://vimeo.com/167029277) from [Sian Townsend](https://medium.com/u/745c6beae85f) on jobs-to-be-done. Consider how you could use jobs-to-be-done to replace personas, roadmap items, user stories, etc.
  6. Make sure you understand exactly how your business makes money (or intends to make money). What assumptions has your company made about the fundamentals? What must remain true for you to continue with business as usual? Sketch it out, and explain it to someone who has just started at your company. If you service a specific vertical, learn exactly how your customers make money as well
  7. Take a field trip with your team (yes, a real trip, with a van, with engineers and UX) to visit a customer. Spend a couple minutes on the drive back to capture key learnings
  8. Set a couple dozen [Google Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts) for news on competitors, customers, and specific domains/markets
  9. Break down silos. Do you speak to someone without your team present? Figure out how to have a conversation together so you aren’t the blocker and/or go-between
  10. Invite customers to the office and schedule a series of activities that they can participate in (e.g. sketching, customer journey mapping, etc.)
  11. Go on site with a customer and record a no-holes-barred, “this is how you could completely change how I work”, video. Bring the inspiration back to the team
  12. Figure out how to have an honest and safe discussion with your team about what is working, and what isn’t working. All too often the presence of the PO/PM stifles conversation (you’d be amazed what they say when you aren’t around). Change that dynamic!
  13. Create a “that drives me crazy” list — things that drive your internal team crazy when they use the product — and dedicate a couple days to knock those things out. It isn’t guaranteed to be customer facing, but it sure will boost morale
  14. Institute a just-in-time meeting policy. Make a Kanban board public. Keep adding agenda items to the board until there is enough stuff to fill a 45 minute meeting. Have the meeting. There’s no sense in talking about stuff until it is actionable and pertinent
  15. Get some photos of real customers who will benefit from your immediate work, and put them up on the wall. Call them as well. Personas are great and all, but real people and real stories inspire people
  16. Organize a customer panel to discuss topics pertaining to an upcoming initiative. Invite the whole team. Seeing the differences and similarities across customers can be eye opening. Plus it’s fun
  17. Partner with your onboarding / customer success / account management team and schedule regular interviews and usability tests with new customers. Fresh eyes are super valuable
  18. Remove a rarely used feature and figure out how to message this to your customers. That wasn’t that bad, was it!?
  19. Work to break through any of the stereotypes you hold about your team (e.g. engineers don’t care about UX, and UX doesn’t care about the business). Invite someone to lunch. Ask about what drives the people you work with
  20. Before you use the words _complicated_ and _complex_, [consider this model from David Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_Framework) . Ask whether the problem you are solving is complicated or complex
  21. Conduct a targeted survey in-app. The targeting matters… you want highly qualified responses. The silent majority of users has a lot to say
  22. Check the adoption of your past five ship and reflect on your product decisions together
  23. Make a commitment to report back to your organization on the outcomes generated from your current effort. Consider [a pre-cap design studio](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/beat-the-feature-factory-run-pre-cap-design-studios-725d1c83ecd7) to flesh out what you want to communicate
  24. Schedule a session where everyone — yes everyone, including engineers — draws ideas, prototypes, etc. Make it official by calling it a [design sprint](https://developers.google.com/design-sprint/downloads/DesignSprintMethods.pdf)
  25. Do some [research on Service Design](http://www.servicedesigntools.org/) . Consider how your product is an integral part of a higher level service, and reach out to other parts of the organization to understand how you can help deliver that service more effectively. Customer journey mapping is a great place to start


# The Healthy Tension Trap

Seriously! We’re all Product Developers!

* * *

### The Healthy Tension Trap

#### Seriously! We’re all Product Developers!

I’m sure you’ve heard something like this before…

> A good designer wants an elegant, polished solution. A good PM wants to
solve the right problem and optimise for speed. A good engineer wants an
implementation that’s maintainable and efficient.
([source](https://blog.intercom.com/healthy-tension-in-product-teams/))

And then you’ll hear about _healthy tension_. The idea is that everyone will
“advocate” for their respective interests, and out will pop an awesome
product. The thinking is that without the keen eye of UX, the interface will
end up looking like a command prompt. Or that without Product cracking the
whip, Engineering will re-factor their code a dozen times, and UX will polish
every pixel (repeatedly, those wacky designers).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*e-hzbTBlfuymmmZKioAaSg.png)

Do you know what happens instead (in many cases)? Mediocrity and complacency.
Green + Red != Christmas. No…. Green + Red = Brown (an “[icky mix that doesn’t
bode well for your pigment/paint](https://www.quora.com/What-color-does-green-
and-red-make)”).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*rZDosDyq2H9xMr9ZB-aXwg.png)

Instead of advocating (and healthfully debating) for the **_best idea, or the
right way to deliver value to customers, _**you end up with bunch of people
playing into various stereotypes, or worse yet chasing the incentives /
rewards of their functional group over a focus on customer needs.

A **_healthy team_** will debate, argue, test, and tweak. It’ll get downright
heated sometimes. _Healthy _**_tension_**_ _assumes no one can think beyond
their functional silo, look at the data, or leverage the respective
backgrounds and skills of their teammates in a productive, non-tense way.
Someone wins, and someone loses.

Quotes [like this](http://www.zdnet.com/article/engineering-design-need-to-go-
hand-in-hand-for-enterprise-software-execs/) drive me crazy:

> “There’s some healthy tension there,” McCoy remarked. “At the end of the
day, the product manager has a primary responsibility to the business. The
designer has a primary responsibility to the user.”

The dreaded **Business** raises its ugly head again (as if there is this clean
line between the engineering org — the factory — and the business/product
folks who know what to build). Designers! Have you been in this position and
rocked that _healthy tension_? Was it fun representing that user? Did you
“win” ?

We are all product developers! We make stuff people use. We wear a ton of
hats. We care! I’m not saying you don’t have a speciality, and a community of
practitioners to learn from, but that is different from carving up your
product development organization.

No one has ever given me a persuasive reason why you can’t just bag the three
functional groups and have a single product development team.

But, but, but …. the CTO doesn’t care about UX! **Bad reason**. But, but, but
… we need a Product org to hold the Engineering org accountable. **Bad
reason**. Most of the reasons have to do with internal personalities, trust,
chains of command, and outdated ideas about how _healthy tension_ can benefit
the product development process. They’re rooted in the idea that you need this
layer (product management) to sit between the business and the engineering
factory, and that UX will sort of float there advocating for good design when
no one will listen. And that we’re all myopically selfish.

Replace tension with trust and diversity. It achieves the same outcome without
the death-by-matrix baggage.

As mentioned in previous posts, the customer doesn’t care one bit how you
structure your org. But if they witnessed the typical positioning,
politicking, and “advocating” that happens in most organizations, they’d
probably laugh. Solve my problem, so I can give you money! And leverage
everyone’s skills to make that happen, regardless of context, functional
group, or agenda.

### Product Development Nerds Unite

#### I want to go to a conference with engineers, UX, customer success ninjas,
data scientists, and product managers/owners! And talk about building stuff
humans value.

Random stock photo from [here](http://www.onlineschoolscenter.com/30-high-
paying-trade-school-degrees/) . Sadly, without this image, I’ll have about
1/5th the number of readers.

There are [product management conferences](http://www.mindtheproduct.com/),
[UX conferences](https://www.uxstrat.com/), [software engineering
conferences](https://chefconf.chef.io/), [customer success
conferences](http://www.gainsight.com/pulse/), [Agile
conferences](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile2016/), and [design thinking
bootcamps](http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/exec-ed/programs/design-thinking-boot-
camp) ($12,500 for four days). And then there are those pesky tracks (bless
the single track conferences, by the way, because I’m a track swinger).

Help me out here. I must be missing the obvious.

Barring some attempts (e.g. [LeanWX 2016](http://2016.leanuxnyc.co/about-us/)
by the LeanUX crew) and the startup focused conferences [Lean
Startup](http://leanstartup.co/2016-conference/?gclid
=CjwKEAjw34i_BRDH9fbylbDJw1gSJAAvIFqUwtVJHkqNskV-
CCBBNGgdg_f7JK2WrWfHX20Q_V7maRoCzSDw_wcB), I can’t seem to find a decent
_product development_ conference. You know, somewhere where the people who do
the work — the people who wear the various hats — get together and talk about
how to make the magic happen. We have all sorts of opportunities to learn how
to make **OUR** magic happen, but not **THE MAGIC**.

Weary consultants have rightfully embraced organizational design as their
_last stand_. It’s HOT. It’s where the money is, and frankly it is where the
problem is as well. Either that, or the big bugaboo scaling. Whole-org
Agility. Lean Startup for the Enterprise. Complexity Theory. The Learning
Organization. Teal Orgs (what a color pick). **Still…where do those of us in
the trenches take off our respective hats and nerd out about the craft of
product development?** I get it, the whole-org stuff cuts big checks, but …

Remember when UX [had to figure out how to coexist with
Agile](http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/04/integrating-ux-into-agile-
development.php)? And when UX [decided to coexist with
Lean?](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/lean-ux-vs-agile-ux-is-
there-a-difference/) Or when Product Managers needed to be [trained on
devops](http://www.mindtheproduct.com/2016/02/what-the-hell-are-ci-cd-and-
devops-a-cheatsheet-for-the-rest-of-us/)? Or folks [finally shed some light on
the Agile PO Role](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-owner-
responsibilities/) (thanks [Roman
Pichler](https://medium.com/u/9562e5263e32))? Or when people finally realized
they were guessing all the time and [needed to validate
outcomes](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/how-implement-hypothesis-
driven-development)? There’s still work to be done, but I’ll pull out this
quote from **The Lean Mindset** by Mary Poppendieck and Tom Poppendieck (with
illustrations from [Henrik Kniberg](https://medium.com/u/3ccad081c81a)):

> We have written three books about software development, but we couldn’t
write a fourth, because the islands of software development have largely
disappeared. In their place we find a new landscape, one in which
infrastructure is a commodity and multidisciplinary teams are expected to ask
the right questions, solve the right problems, and deliver solutions that
customers love. True, those solutions are often software-intensive. In fact,
just about everything is software-intensive these days, so isolating software
on its own island doesn’t make much sense anymore.

To what degree are we reinforcing these islands with the conferences we
organize, departments we create, blog posts we write, and titles we assign?
I’m not belittling the importance of craft, disciplines, and areas of
practice. It’s all important and we’re getting pretty damn good at it. But I’m
asking whether you also need an equal focus — a truly cross-functional focus —
on the collaborative craft.

Are we structuring our learning like we have structured our orgs? Are we
worrying more about the bastions of product, ux, agile coaching, and
engineering more than the success of what we build?

This is why I love [Jeff Patton’s](https://twitter.com/jeffpatton?lang=en)
[story mapping book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033851.do) (see
[this video for a summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R1z8POfvgQ)). On
the surface the book is about story mapping, but the subtitle “Discover the
Whole Story, Build the Right Product” is pretty spot on. It is a full-contact,
full-team sport. And everyone plays.

Where do I go to get this fix? I love me some UX and Product conferences. But
I’m also tired of people talking about other people when they’re not in the
room. Where can we all get in the same room?

Let’s discuss in the comments (if you feel like it)


# The Overlap

The Messy World of Modern Software Product Development (With User Interfaces)

* * *

### The Overlap

#### The Messy World of Modern Software Product Development (With User
Interfaces)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*p-Xmpg3MFXo3Ie4G0LgGMw.png)

In forward thinking product development organizations, **product management
and UX have become increasingly overlapped**. Concurrently, we have seen a
move towards **collaborative design** — involving engineers and other
stakeholders in the design process. These two factors have had a dramatic
impact on how product development teams organize, work, and deliver value to
customers. In this post I am going to explore some of these impacts.

#### A Vignette From the Trenches

_Everyone is reasonably good at everything (except maybe Engineering, though
some UX and Product folks have chops), and really good at some things…_

First, let me paint a picture based on my career and recent personal
experience. Imagine a team with a UX researcher, UX designer, product owner,
engineers, quality assurance, customer success rep, and an agile coach.

They’re all in a van visiting a customer’s office. They’ve been spending the
last couple days engaged in various activities: design studios, customer
journey mapping, user story mapping, listening to customer interviews, and
building a backlog of experiments to run.

The walls back at their office are plastered with artifacts…stickies from a
[pre-mortem](https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem), [a story
map](http://jpattonassociates.com/the-new-backlog/), wireframes (drawn by
everyone), and a [lean canvas](https://leanstack.com/lean-canvas/). Everyone
is engaged and contributing.

The PO isn’t the single owner of the backlog (the whole team owns it). The UX
designer isn’t the single owner of the design (the whole team owns it, and is
reasonably design savvy as a whole). The PO isn’t the sole owner of defining
the problem (the whole team explored it, with help from the UX researcher who
did a deep dive a week prior).

And the pairing! QA is pairing with UX to explore interesting edge-cases. An
engineer paired with the customer success rep to analyze existing customer
data. And the UX researcher paired with the product owner and another engineer
prior to the effort to do some preliminary research.

#### That Sounds Batshit Crazy

_This only happens in the movies… As a designer this would drive me crazy
…Can’t they just write a spec?_

  * **Sound terribly inefficient?** Perhaps, though we are chasing efficacy and outcomes and the madness addresses these goals remarkably well
  * **Sound impossible without a ton of resources?** Probably, if you only just hired your first UX designer
  * **Sound completely foreign, and you have a tough time believing things actually function this way? **It’s rare, but this is how some of the best cross-functional product development teams operate now (2016)

#### PUX

_The product owner gets their world rocked…_

The role that has been most impacted by these shifts **is the product owner**
role. No exaggeration, but my role recently as a UX researcher (at a West
Coast, recently IPOed SaaS company) was nearly indistinguishable from what I
_used _to do as a PM/PO a decade ago:

  * **User stories?** Yup, as an output of facilitated activities with the team.
  * **Deep customer/user research?** Yup, prior to and during the initiative.
  * **Measuring the impact of the initiative?** Yup, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Lines are blurred.

A Director of Product Management remarks:

> My biggest problem is the overlaps. Our UX folks and product owners have
such an overlap of responsibilities and skills, that it is difficult to keep
everyone engaged. I almost feel like a new role or title is in order. Sure,
the PO does some of the tactical record-keeping stuff. They do the status
checks and keep me informed. But the reality is that this team could run well
without one (a PO).

> My challenge is that we have already established these structures. I can’t
just say “don’t work”. I have people to engage. I want them to share in the
excitement. But in some cases their getting overwhelmed by all of these very
experienced people

This isn’t an environment that an associate product manager will navigate with
grace. It’s hard. It has become a game of who can contribute valuable context
and skills to the soup. A pure meritocracy. The customer needs no
representation because the customer is literally on the phone and the team is
decently skilled at asking the right questions. Heavy prioritization is
unnecessary because the team is moving quickly enough to try new things (with
real customers) at will.

One major factor here is the rise of UX. The UX tool chest has always been
broad (research, validation, iteration, etc.). They just didn’t get a chance
to flex their muscles until recently. Turns out designers make great
sensemakers and untanglers and know a thing or two about customer value. Throw
in collaborative design, and suddenly your engineers are a bunch of entry
level UXers and product owners. Cool huh?

Which in turn impacts the product owner. The formulaic “1 PO per one or two
teams” starts to feel very archaic. In its place we ask “what do we need, and
who can provide what we need?”:

  * If in-depth data science is required, we should find a data scientist
  * If coordination with the marketing team is required, we should find a coordinator
  * If more context is needed about the business objective, we should find a business analyst

You get the idea. To be valuable, product owners must leverage differentiated
skills. My prediction: the product owner/product manager titles will morph as
new, more specialized roles march to the trenches. [I have a simple table
describing how I see the product manager role
evolving](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/the-evolving-product-manager-role-
6f288bbc3cda).

#### The Clan

_Where do I belong? Who cuts my check?_

In a lightly matrixed environment, it is clear who your clan is. You have a
boss. You go back to home base to recharge. Your services are “loaned out” (or
even billed out, in some cases) to these teams. It’s a services model.
Engineers form the nucleus, and you swoop in when you can to help out.

Things are different with these [highly formed, normed, stormed, and
performing teams](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_86.htm). You
now have a **team **(a _squad?)_**_._** You’ve gone through rough times and
happy times. They’ve called you out in a retrospective for slacking. You made
up, and formed a stronger bond after the rift.

The matrix is hard. It is made _much harder _when you are fully embedded on a
team. It’s almost not a matrix anymore, except for the pesky question of who
gives you your marching orders to a new project, a raise, promotes you, and
coaches you. Is it the people who have contact with you day to day? Or the
whole network of coordinators and managers who exist to keep the whole matrix
pumping?

The services model brand of matrixing has given way to being fully embedded.
Everyone is invited to the retrospective. Which ironically has made things
much more confusing. My prediction is that we’ll see the matrix dissolve with
[Spotify-like chapters](http://www.full-stackagile.com/2016/02/14/team-
organisation-squads-chapters-tribes-and-guilds/) providing the functional
camaraderie, hiring, and career development. Product and UX teams must adopt
new structures to evolve.

#### Patterns and Consistency

_It won’t happen without a pattern library…_

[Jeff Gothelf](https://medium.com/u/94a2a063be85) makes a great case for
pattern libraries in [his LeanUX
book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0074KA0A4/ref=dp-kindle-
redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). Reflecting on the last couple years I can
say, without a doubt, that pattern libraries are one of the core components in
this new reality. To achieve any level of consistency in the midst of all this
independence and autonomy, you’ll need more than weekly design reviews. Things
are moving too fast for consistency to take work. Consistency needs to be
automatic. A solid _live _pattern library also empowers rapid prototyping and
collaborative design. If using the _right _pattern takes any extra work, then
the wrong pattern will hit production.

Simply put, getting the plumbing straight for this needs to happen. It needs
to be made a priority. But pulling it together will pay massive dividends.

#### T-Shaped On Purpose (Or By Accident)

_A little of this, a little o’that, and a lot of that…_

Whether we like it or not, in this model we’re all becoming more T-Shaped.
Wikipedia has some good “Also Known As” terms for T-Shaped:

  * [Versatilist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versatilist "Versatilist" )
  * Generalizing Specialist
  * Technical Craftsperson
  * Renaissance Developer
  * Master Generalist

The net effect? Well, everyone has something to say about UX and product
decisions. It might not be perfectly informed, but it’s not like you’re
operating in a vacuum. Low and behold:

  * The engineer has a better UX solution
  * The team refuses to release the crappy MVP
  * The product owner can wireframe like a bat-out-of-hell
  * We all have trained for years to do things that aren’t as easy as they seem (but the team will think they’re trivial)

This requires a big dose of humility, perspective, and empathy. Great story.
After finishing and summarizing a customer call (audio edit and notes), I
asked an engineer for some technical help. He solved it with a brilliant one-
liner.

> **Me:** Dude, that was amazing! I could never do that in a million years.  
> **Eng:** No, no … I could teach you. That call was amazing. Great stuff. I’d
never be able to do that in a million years.  
> **Me**: No, no … I could teach you.

Get used to not being the smartest person in the room. And get used to having
to show people your value, instead of hiding behind process or titles. In
prior realities someone would toss an idea over the wall, and another team
would pick it up. They’d grumble and curse about your mistakes and
incompetence, but it would never get real. Now things get real, and that’s OK
because you’ve made your environment safe right?

If not, you’re in trouble.
[Scuttlebutt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuttlebutt) makes this all fall
apart.

#### Speaking Engineer, UX, Product, QA

_We’re all on _**_A_**_ spectrum…_

What used to get resolved with silos, departments, process, and gatekeepers,
is now solved by people working it out together. Newsflash: engineers, UX, QA,
and [insert functional area here] don’t always communicate the same way. For
teams to function like this you need help (Agile Coaching?), time, and
patience. You can’t just drop a junior person into the mix and hope they “pick
it up”. To an outsider it’ll seem crazy.

We all have to develop great communication skills. There is no filter, and
waiting around for one would be kind of silly.

#### In Closing

This has been rambling, and I’ll probably go deeper in future posts. Let me
try to recap:

  * A lot of rules, process, and titles get messed up the further you advance down the road towards fully autonomous, cross-functional teams. If you try to cling to the old way, you’ll really confuse people. You have to take the plunge to discover new structures and ways of working (which will also confuse people)
  * The further you evolve the more challenging the PO role becomes
  * The Matrix dissolves or morphs. New structures and ways of working rise from the ashes. Anyone can provide value anywhere. You’ll still need to become an expert at melding with new teams though
  * Anything that happens “just because” doesn’t cut it. Is the team functioning with the necessary skills and hats? If not, change things
  * We need to adapt to a new reality of T-Shaped individuals, and learn how to communicate without pre-defined processes
  * It’s messy as hell! And the tendency is to say “oh, it’s too messy and inefficient”. But if you let these types of teams build their mojo you’ll be blown away by the results


# 6 Questions to Guide Continuous Improvement

Do the work…

### 6 Questions to Guide Continuous Improvement

#### Do the work…

There’s no silver bullet: continuous improvement takes resources and work,
humility, empathy, and [teaming](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle
/productCd-078797093X.html). It is less about the methodology you pick (across
hundreds of templates and books you’ll find remarkably similar themes these
days) and more about the work you do, and the degree to which you can reflect
on the meta-process of improving how you improve.

Which means we need to heed [Steven Pressfield’s advice and Do The
Work](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NK0MJBK/ref=dp-kindle-
redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1).

Give it a try!

**Below you’ll find 6 questions that I have found particularly useful for guiding continuous improvement efforts.** Gather a cross-section from your team — mixed seniority and functional areas — and have a conversation about these questions. Of course, you’ll need safety (see question 1) to have the conversation (see question 6), but maybe that is your starting point. That’s your first hurdle. You have to start somewhere.

See the **Notes** section for some commentary on these questions

How **effective are we at:**

  1. Maintaining a safe and healthy environment for individuals and teams?
  2. Resolving areas of widespread cognitive dissonance?
  3. Learning and converting our learnings into customer value?
  4. Dampening the negative impacts of scaling and growth?
  5. Helping our people and teams grow?
  6. Sensing changes to, and continuously improving on the the areas above?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*QKJ5w5WS_zX7myiutqR4KQ.png)

Talk about it. What have you observed? What is the delta since you last spoke?
How do your individual biases impact your perception of what you have
observed? Are you hearing all voices? Are you missing data? Where are the
opportunities for improvement? What would happen if you did nothing? Might
certain things just work themselves out?

One of my mentors wisely cautioned:

> Fight the temptation to see continuous improvement as a conduit for your pet
projects and career advancement. It’s tempting. One of the biggest blockers to
change is the desire to take credit for it.

Set a “Change In Progress” limit and prioritize [safe-to-fail
experiments](http://cognitive-edge.com/methods/safe-to-fail-probes/). Too much
change or change that is too prescriptive is the enemy of successful
evolution. Stop starting and start finishing. Consider a continuous
improvement Kanban board detailing ongoing efforts. Rinse and repeat. [As
David Snowden writes:](https://hbr.org/2007/11/a-leaders-framework-for-
decision-making)

> Instructive patterns can emerge if the leader conducts experiments that are
safe to fail. That is why, instead of attempting to impose a course of action,
leaders must patiently allow the path forward to reveal itself. They need to
probe first, then sense, and then respond.

This requires a certain level of introspection and humility. What if a leader
is contributing to the problem? At the root of cognitive dissonance (2) we
often find friction between leaders which manifests in unclear objectives and
unnecessary tension. To see our own failings more clearly it may be necessary
to cast a wider net for data (e.g. engagement surveys, 360 and peer reviews,
etc.) Leaders are, in that regard, team members. It is Team with a capital
“T”.

### Notes

  1. Safe environments welcome diversity, risk taking, experimentation, dissent, and sharing difficult feedback. Individuals can be authentic. Unsafe environments do this selectively, or not at all
  2. Examples might include the acceptance of toxic behavior from an individual, inability to respond to a growing threat, or situation where teams/individuals have accepted a way of working that is hurtful/unhealthy to others. It is widespread in the sense that has reached “watercooler status” or a frequent topic of 1:1 so-called [scuttlebutt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuttlebutt)
  3. Context and data can inform a team, but it does not in itself produce positive outcomes. You’re marrying two competencies — to [Sense and Respond](http://senseandrespond.co/)
  4. Examples of negative effects attributable to scaling and growth include accumulation of technical debt, UX debt, increased dependencies, hardening silos, decreased speed and agility, decreased information flow, disengaged teams, premature optimization, etc. Many of these “costs” are invisible and difficult to quantity which complicates the issue.
  5. Importantly, this can sometimes involve individuals “growing out” of the organization. One could argue that for the benefit of the company you’d like to see a shared growth goal that benefits company / individual, but I’ve found this to be unrealistic and counterproductive expectation (and profoundly immune to intervention).
  6. Continuous improvement involves regular discussion, action, and reflection. Are you addressing the right questions? Are your conversations safe? Are you gathering all available data?


# To the 40+ Year Old PMs

Do you stay in the trenches, or get out? Why? And what does this mean for
teams?

* * *

### To the 40+ Year Old PMs

#### Do you stay in the trenches, or get out? Why? And what does this mean for
teams?

You’re 40+ and involved in product management.

Maybe you took some detours in your twenties and thirties: played in a band
(that’s me!), started a business (yup, did that), freelanced to be at home
with your kids while they were young, or tried something completely different.

You love product development. You want to stay on the front lines and in the
trenches. You want to remain a doer. You enjoy coaching, mentoring, and
showing people how to fish, but you aren’t a good fit for traditional
management roles. You speak product, UX, business, and engineer. The extra
money would be nice, but so is your sanity and sense of accomplishment.

Your pattern matching and BS detector is on point. You see organizational
dysfunction through the sharp eyes of someone who has played the game for a
while. Maybe that’s not your sweetspot.

If you’re engineer, there is a path. Be a 10x behind-the-scenes person. Most
orgs welcome that. Craft it up, coach folks, and crank it out. You’re making
$200k and still get to keep your hands dirty.

But us older product owners and product managers … we have a different
predicament. We’re being told to “advance”, “move up”, “shift companies”,
“move out of product management” (for PMs), or “start consulting” (for more UX
focused PM/POs). Recently, I was told bluntly that “if this hasn’t happened by
the time you’re 40, well that is a warning sign!”

But I like being on the front-lines!

The trouble is that the further you “move up”, the further you get away from
where the work is happening, and the closer you get to executive level
dysfunction. For some that means a desirable corner office. For others that
makes it un-fun. Explains a fellow PM:

> I keep struggling with this dilemma. If I care for my career and earning
potential I will need to stop doing this! But I work best and provide the most
value when I’m with my teams. It seems like my best option is to company hop
for a while to keep things interesting

Agile prescribes a PM/PO for every one or two teams. As teams scale this
necessitates an ungainly product org. The economics kick in and you fill your
org with junior and/or associate PMs to fill the warm seat prescribed by
Agile. Which in turn pisses off your experienced engineers. You’re being told
to leave the area where your impact is needed most.

And then people wonder where the good PM/POs have gone! If you’re a more
technically focused PM/PO you might have some options, but for many this is
the end of the line.

I don’t have an answer here. But this is a problem if we are to advance the
“craft” of product management and product ownership and deliver great value to
teams. How do you engage your older team members and keep your best? Or is
this the inevitable conveyor belt of talent and career development?

This morning I woke up to this tweet from Jeff Patton:

### #agilebrandproblem

This morning I woke up to this tweet from Jeff Patton:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*IqYsOliimYMyaoKB.)

I found this interesting on a number levels. First, it was a gimme punchline
at a product conference. Well played! I’ve heard plenty of gimme PM jokes at
other conferences, so it sort of comes with the conference territory. Not a
big deal.

Second, I found it laced with some juicy (likely unintentional) irony. I’m
pretty up on the product community, and I’ve polled people during my talks, so
I feel fairly confident to point out some likely patterns and quotes from a
good chunk of the 1,400 people in attendance during their day to day work:

  * “We need to ship more quickly”
  * “How many _resources _do I have at my disposal to build this stuff?”
  * “We have to move on to the next feature so [insert reason here]”
  * “We can’t afford to work down that technical debt! You’re guessing it will keep us from slowing down. I need data”
  * “I need an estimate, please, so I can [ insert reason here ]”
  * “We really need to get an MVP out there now! And then we’ll, um, come back to it at some point in the future after we’ve done [other things]”
  * How infrequently product managers actually focus on customer outcomes vs. feature delivery
  * How often PMs shoot for 100% utilization (aka team Tetris), which sets up teams for catastrophic collapse when something doesn’t go right, which in turn impacts the customer
  * The conference is called Mind The Product, not Mind The Customer. Sure, we still purchase products. But in the software world we are increasingly renting services (delivered through various, evolving products / touch-points) that yield outcomes. In my experience, PMs often have primary allegiance to this nebulous “product”, not customers, users, or outcomes

No wonder people use points and velocity! No wonder some forward thinkers in
the Agile community are arguing that estimates shouldn’t be necessary (see
#noestimates). No wonder UX is injecting some life into product management!

I’m pretty sure this wasn’t what the speaker was thinking. Maybe they were
selling something else. So I’ll just let it blow over as a good joke.

Anyway, what I was struck most by was Jeff’s term Agile Brand Problem
(#agilebrandproblem). The **branding** of Agile, and all the various ways
people are trying to capitalize on that brand … yeah, there’s your problem.

I’ve attended big Agile conferences. And yes, the busy tracks are filled with
people buying into the Agile solution. Let’s DO AGILE™ THE BRAND. It makes it
it an easy target for conference jokes. The UX and Product tracks can be
pretty sparse, and PO focused talks tend to bring out the Agile Coaches trying
desperately to help their POs do their job.

Heck, even Agilists crack jokes about Agile (see [Joshua
Kerievsky](https://medium.com/u/28229c304ac9) and his wonderful Modern Agile
work, and read up on his great jokes at Agile 2016). I like Josh’s approach
because he’s not being dogmatic, and evolving like Agile suggests you evolve.

Agile has become an umbrella term for so many practices, methodologies,
frames, principles, stuff to buy, people to hire, etc. that it’s bewildering
to the user (forget branding for a moment). But I think this is natural as
things like Agile evolve. They start focused and principle based. Then welcome
all sorts of experimentation and exploitation and grow a chest of offshoots
and interpretations. And then sort of fold in on themselves under the weight.
Layer that with two (and now coming on three) generations of consultants
looking for their Agile Angle, and you’ll develop a self-inflicted branding
problem.

At this point Lean is sort of past that. It is sufficiently “old” that you can
use it at will, anywhere, without too much of the baggage. Once people got
over the six-sigma associations and connecting it primarily with
manufacturing, it became a good nondescript gimme that could be tacked on to
anything for good effect. Are people trying to brand Lean as just Lean™? Let
me know.

Anyway. Being a punchline is nothing new for Agile, Product Managers,
Engineers, UX, Project Managers, etc. It’s easy to have a laugh. But it
doesn’t really move forward the craft of product development. Rah rah
conferences for the functional skillsets are good for keeping the hope alive,
sharing information, and having some beers with likeminded individuals. Real
work is required to figure out how we can work together.

### 30 Things I Think about When Meeting a Product Dev Org for the First Time

_File this post under Listicles John Creates to Keep His Own Thinking
Straight_

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*6zCgxz_r1MTzEiPtPIjbzw.jpeg)

An actual set of notes … my spelling is atrocious

What is it like to drop into organization and take stock of the team?

I was asked recently to describe what was going on in my head when I meet with
teams for the first time. There are scorecards and maturity models for all
this, but I found myself talking in terms of themes and areas of inquiry.
Below I’ve taken a stab at listing what I look for when I’m doing a health-
check for a new team. Hopefully this is of some use to internal coaches,
analysts, consultants, VCs, or individuals vetting prospective employer.

Important! It is very tempting to let your biases run rampant here. Keep
reminding yourself to focus on individual, team, customer, and organization
needs. What must this team excel at given their situation?

  1. **Decisions.** What is their product development decision track-record. A perfect track-record is not what we’re looking for. How quickly do they make reasonably good decisions? Do they flounder until someone makes a political breakthrough and advances their specific agenda? Or are decent decisions delivered more regularly? Equally important, look for the process by which the team measures and reflects on the quality of their decisions.
  2. **Information Flow.** How does information flow from the market and customers to the builders and designers on the front-lines? Where is there signal loss? Where are there switches and filters? Where is the signal amplified?
  3. **Continuous Improvement.** What is their approach to continuous improvement? How is it directed and controlled? Who participates? Can the team point to tangible examples of improvement? Look for efforts to take credit for improvement efforts. Struggle over ownership of change efforts is often the blocker to meaningful change.
  4. **Internal Feedback Loops.** Thinking beyond the market/customer feedback loop, describe how feedback moves internally … up, down, and across. Is it funneled, and if so by whom? Who “knows everything” and why? This is related to continuous improvement, but worth mapping out to compliment that discussion.
  5. **Handoffs.** Spend time observing handoffs. These can be incredibly informative. How does an idea get delivered? Who is waiting for what? Are sprints staggered? Focus on the I/O of the organization and the various functional roles. Map these out. Are these handoffs a function of team needs, or the needs of the organization to control work?
  6. **Utilization Rates.** Is utilization very high? Scan for examples of “keeping people busy” and chasing high utilization. Also look for mechanisms that preserve slack. Couple this with attitudes towards multi-tasking and tackling concurrent projects. There is no right/wrong here (there are economic reasons to tackle multiple projects), but it pays to pay attention.
  7. **Flow.** I’m a big believer in the concept of [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29). Mostly because it’s something people everywhere can relate to. You’re suitably challenged, you’re in the zone, and you exude a calm, productive energy. You sense your impact. Are individuals and teams experiencing a sense of flow? How often? If not, what happens instead? Is there high drama, a lot of start and stop, or a sense of being “stuck”?
  8. **Debt Work-Down.** How does the organization monitor and work down its various areas of debt (learning, UX, tech, cultural, etc.) ? Is there shared understanding around the costs/rewards? Does the team routinely work down debt, including the removal of unused features? How are these costs “accounted” for?
  9. **Roadmap.** Ask to see the product roadmap, and discuss how it is used as an artifact across the organization. Is it a list of features? How are the goals described? Is it shared broadly? Is it a living document? Why, and why not? Explore how other roadmap users (from the front-lines to the leadership team) view the roadmap process. Are people getting value out of the roadmap?
  10. **Data/Evidence.** How is qualitative and quantitative data used to drive decisions? Is data a regular part of the decisions making process, or is the approach more “ad hoc”? What is on the monitors in the hallway? Where do the data-silos exist, and do people care?
  11. **Mentorship/Coaching.** What is the approach to mentorship and coaching? Approach this from a broad perspective (most efforts are not formal). Do team members attribute their personal and professional development to the organization and/or people in the organization? How do people grow? Where does someone go if the blocker is their boss?
  12. **Ideas vs. Problems.** Is this an idea oriented team or a problem focused team? Check for mentions of the best idea winning, the need to advocate strongly for your ideas, or celebrating great ideas. Contrast this with a problem focused frame, where the team relates strongly to solving a particular problem for a customer/user (or the organization). One isn’t better than another, but this will have a strong impact on how the org operates.
  13. **Features vs. Outcomes.** Somewhat related … is the team feature-centric or outcome/mission centric? Pay close attention to how/when teams celebrate, and what they celebrate. Look at user stories and backlog items. Listen during meetings. Is a project “done” when it ships?
  14. **Collaboration.** How does collaboration happen in the day-to-day? Spend time observing people work together. Is the mood forced and artificial, or voluntary and natural? Contrast this with the official narrative on how work gets done.
  15. **Cross-Functional Interactions.** Focus specifically on cross-functional interactions. Where is this easy, and where is it hard? Where do buffers exist? Who initiates these interactions? Is it driven by process, or by local need? Is the office organized to encourage the cross pollination of ideas?
  16. **Work Division.** How is work divided among teams and individuals? Refer to the org chart, and contrast this with what you see on the ground. Are there functional silos? Component teams? Is Conway’s Law in effect? Who makes the decisions on how to divvy the challenge? Are these structures morphable and adaptable to address present needs? Do teams have some say in what they work on?
  17. **Safety and Trust.** Is there sufficient safety and trust for teams to “get real”? Where _can_ this happen and where _does_ it happen? Where are the natural boundaries to safety? Could a front-line engineer have a frank discussion with the CEO? What would happen?
  18. **Cadenced Meetings.** Do an inventory of cadenced meetings. Who is invited? Who actually participates? How does the output of the meeting catalyze action elsewhere?
  19. **Releasing Product.** Can the team release product without fear? And is there a devops mindset? Figure out what is actually involved for something to get into the hands of customers. Who must approve? Who must touch it? How does the team know if something is amiss?
  20. **This vs. That.** Listen for how the team describes the various dichotomies / tensions in their work. Is it speed vs. quality? Learning vs. shipping? Proud vs. shipped? These narratives can tell you a great deal about the forces at play
  21. **Core Relationships.** The organization will typically mimic the relationships of a couple core individuals (often leaders, sometimes founders, etc.) Look closely at these relationships. Are there overlapping strengths? Productive tensions? Trust?
  22. **Safe To Fail.** How often does the team fail, openly acknowledge that failure, and indicate the ability to learn from that failure? Is their approach too safe? Could they be taking more risks? We are looking for a healthy amount of failure, otherwise there’s likely not enough learning happening
  23. **Messy Middle.** Look closely at the “messy middle” of the organization that sits between leadership, and the individuals doing the work. What happens there? What is the value add? Is this group open to change, or intent on controlling it?
  24. **Me vs. We vs. Them.** Focus on how words are used. Listen for I, Me, Us, We, They, or Them. How does that manifest in how individuals and teams interact?
  25. **Craft Communities.** Are there informal communities of craft (and practice) ? You’re looking here for the ability for the various functional groups in the org to support themselves vs. needing more formal structures.
  26. **Expert Status.** What is this organization great at? By great I mean true, world class experts. Is that known and celebrated? Is it the “right” thing to excel at?
  27. **Walls.** What is on the walls? You’d be amazed at what you can learn by just looking at the walls. Are the whiteboards outdated? How about stickies? Kanban boards?
  28. **Consistency.** How is consistency maintained? This is an interesting one. There are ways to maintain consistency that involve a lot of command and control. For example, you can set up a design review board and approve designs individually. Conversely, you can also maintain design consistency with a living pattern library and communities of interest. That’s one example. You can expand this to other areas including quality efforts, hiring, etc.
  29. **Celebration.** Pay attention to how the organization celebrates its wins and learns from its mistakes. Do teams get credit? Individuals? Is work viewed as a slog, or is there a natural ebb and flow?
  30. **Narratives.** I’m amazed by how many teams are incapable of sharing their foundational stories. What has brought them to this point? When did they slay the last dragon? Dig for stories as they form the foundation.

Hope this helps others as they analyze a product development team.


# What Do You Need? What Do We Need?

What do you need? What does your company need? Why? What are you trying to
achieve? What must you optimize for?

### What Do You Need? What Do We Need?

#### What do you need? What does your company need? Why? What are you trying
to achieve? What must you optimize for?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*_r3zVICDbrBWeXq0lPKTCg.jpeg)

Doodling while thinking about the “real” org chart

Change is not difficult. Agreeing on what to change — what you need — is
difficult. Resistance to change is not static. It is active and tightly wound
… a system of competing change initiatives. This is why it is easy for
consultants to plot the “right” way forward, but no silver-bullet to actually
enact that change.

Need is a tricky topic. Individuals have needs. Individuals band together as
teams, and those teams express the amalgam of individual needs. In theory we
develop a product that addresses the needs of our customers, partners, and
“market”. These complex systems develop ecosystem-like needs of their own.

Here’s a list of needs expressed at a recent retro I facilitated:

  * Long, mid, and short term economic outcomes for the organization
  * Long, mid, and short term economic outcomes for individuals
  * Improving outcomes for customers
  * Addressing the needs of the user when there is a customer/user differentiation
  * Individual challenge and skills development
  * Increased sphere of influence for individuals
  * Opportunity to practice craft (e.g. “good design”, or “clean code”)
  * Advancing a cause, disruptive change, mission, or fundamental shift
  * Eliminating frustration, “busy work”, focus on optimization and “smooth sailing”
  * Maintaining unity, harmony, quality of personal relationships. Community building
  * Preserving / defending psychological safety

Consider an example.

  * A **UX team member** is advocating for a solution that will contribute to the organization’s long term economic outcomes, meet their definition of a “good job”, increase the influence of UX in the organization, and let them notch a win which assures their mid-term economic survival.
  * Meanwhile **the product manager** advocates for a solution that addresses short term economic realities, only marginally improves customer outcomes, and maintains a healthy (but perhaps less optimal) harmony between stakeholder needs.

Who is right? Throw in another hundred people into the mix. Who is right now?
Is there a right answer? No. But some things most certainly have a negative
impact:

  1. Assuming your past experiences qualify you to interpret future needs, or that your organization’s needs today will resemble its needs in the future
  2. Lacking fundamental psychological safety in your organization. Are people free and safe to express their needs and perspectives?
  3. Expecting to change individual value systems. You might help someone become more at peace with their values, or show more empathy for the needs of others, but trying to change what they value is a tall order
  4. Assuming someone isn’t motivated because they don’t care about the same things you care about.
  5. Assuming you’re talking about the same thing when you say something like “user friendly” or “agile” or “pivot”. Shared understanding matters
  6. Failing to express your own needs as your own needs. Instead of saying “it is important for me to consider the customer in this case” you advocate for a methodology, or directly attack the motives of a team member. Are you communicating your own needs effectively?
  7. Assuming everyone cares about the economic success of the business in the same way. Some people don’t care at all, or they prioritize customer outcomes over business outcomes, or they care primarily about short/long term outcomes. What can you leverage in this case for everyone’s mutual benefit?
  8. Assuming a person’s passion for a point of view is proportional to the amount of time they spend complaining about it. They might care, but not _really _care. Or they may be afraid, and choose not to voice their deep concerns.

This is what I’ve been mulling on today.

What do I need? What do you need?It’s a good start.


# 10 Ways PMs Can Earn The Respect and Trust of Their Team

### 10 Ways PMs Can Earn The Respect and Trust of Their Team

#### … because once you’ve lost it, you’re pretty screwed

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*X57glPnDN_hC08jWZQXn3A.png)

In [Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon
Valley](https://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Monkeys-Obscene-Fortune-Failure-
ebook/dp/B019MMUAAQ), Antonio Garcia Martinez describes the plight of the
disrespected and distrusted PM:

> The most pitiful sight in the Facebook Ads team was the PMs who had lost the
confidence of their engineers. Nominally in charge of some product area, they
were like the government in exile of some occupied nation: sitting there with
all the pomp of their position, sending emails and road maps hither and yon,
and yet producing nothing.

Similarly, I’ve seen teams that waited until the product manager disappeared
for the next meeting, and then let out a collective groan of dismay. Sadly,
this is often a gradual process. A couple bad decisions. Some back pedaling. A
white lie. Some marathon meetings with no purpose/point. So it’s better to
have a positive start.

How do you earn the respect and trust of your team?

  1. **Create “passing tests” for your product development initiatives**, and be diligent about reporting on progress. Heck, engineers do this all day, so some rigor on your side is always appreciated. I’m not talking “did it ship?”. I’m talking “what progress are we making towards meeting the desired business objective?” or “were my assumptions correct or not?” Sure, making decisions that turn out to kick-ass goes a long way towards building a level of respect, but so does being honest about your failures and lapses of judgement.
  2. **Don’t be a pushover**. It’s easy for the team to see through you. You come back from a big meeting, moping, tentative, and then mutter something about needing to move on to the next feature. Now, you may have fought tooth and nail in that meeting to stay the course, but the team doesn’t know that. At the next standup, they see a pummeled and beaten PM. The solution is to avoid getting to this point in the first place. Align people around a goal early, and fight to stay focused on that goal until you’ve reached a precise point (a passing test). If you can’t do that for whatever reason, be clear about that from the get-go. Sometimes being the whipping boy/girl for your org is just how the PM cookie crumbles (in which case you might consider another job).
  3. **Acknowledge what you don’t know. Don’t make shit up! **Don’t say “well customers are saying …. “ when you can’t list those customers, or those two customers represent 2% of your customer-base. Don’t say “the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive” when you did a single call. When you’re using your intuition, say “my intuition — based on x,y,z — tells me option A”. Humility goes a long way.
  4. **Treat your team like adults!** If you go home each night fashioning yourself a cat herder, it will manifest in your day to day work. “Those crazy engineers with their nerf guns! Thank goodness there’s an adult here that lives in the real world of business and has to attend stressful meetings all day” … **don’t think or say that, because you’ll act like a jerk.** You are not their manager. You are the product’s manager. Any hint of paternalism and you’re DOA (dead on arrival). This also goes for giving and receiving (hopefully constructive) feedback. Yes, you can go run off behind the team’s back and have a teary-eyed 1:1 with a scrum master or tech lead begging to be respected. Or you can advocate for a regular and well-facilitated retro and in a non-defensive manner accept and give feedback like an adult.
  5. **Don’t stereotype.** Related to #3, but resist the various software engineer stereotypes that exist. I know engineers with social anxiety, engineers who win Toastmasters, former golf pros, guitar god engineers, guys/girls who code best when high, ballroom dancing engineers, ex-Army Rangers, and brogrammers. Nothing quashes respect faster than assuming everyone is [insert whatever you think here].
  6. **Do something valuable!** Seriously, imagine if you were knee-deep in solving complex problems, and someone showed up after 6hrs of meetings with nothing to show for it, or no additional information that assisted you in solving your problem? And loaded you up with new tasks and lots of annoying questions about estimates as they seemingly played Tetris with you and your teammates? You’d lose respect for the person. Start with a simple “what can I do to help” or “what data or context can I provide?” Make yourself available but don’t distract. Deliver value to the team. I’ve said this before, but my favorite questions for a team is “if you controlled the budget, would you hire your current PM?” Not providing value at this particular moment? Well, then go away and let people work!
  7. **Respect context switching, the price of multi-tasking, and the need for slack.** Think about the message you’re sending when you try to keep the team nose-to-the-grindstone, 98% utilized, every minute of the year. Or harp away about velocity and story points. Or be an ass about debt work-down stories or refactoring. Do you think that cramming those four extra points into the 40 point week is going to make a big difference? No. And when something goes slightly wrong, and the over-taxed team goes into a death spiral, it will royally suck. Don’t play Team Tetris. Product development isn’t an assembly line. The goal is to ship outcomes, not story output.
  8. **Do the mental gymnastics**. Related to #6. I once had an engineer friend tell me “you know, I don’t inherently dislike specs. In fact, if you write an excellent spec it will make my day. What I dislike are commands where the person doesn’t think about the problem. They just spew out requirements and don’t think the thing through.” Analyze the customer problem. Consider the non-happy path. Find different angles. Do your homework. Speak economically, but be able to back up your suggestions. You may not be an engineer. You may not be technical. But you can at least practice sound reasoning and problem solving.
  9. **Stop talking about YOUR ideas. **Represent the customer and their problems. Talk about business opportunities. Bring data and context. Be an amplifier. Suggest your ideas, but bring everyone to the table to discuss alternate proposals. To many engineers, PMs come off as narcissistic, CEO wannabes, with nothing tangible to add, and a lot of career aspirations. This team assignment is just the stepping stone. You have to create a persuasive case for the outlay of effort beyond “um, the business thinks this is a good idea” or “this will totally rock!” I’ve heard it mentioned that engineers make a cost/benefit decisions once every 15 minutes. Before cluttering up the code base, they want to hear a halfway decent rationale for the work. And they remember prior decisions like hawks. That feature you shipped two years ago? Yeah, no one ended up using it. Strike three against you! It’s easy to assume your team doesn’t care if they don’t ask. I’ve even had engineers say “you know, I don’t care anymore, just tell me what to do.” But this is result of losing respect for you. You have to rebuild it.
  10. **Have fun and don’t be a basket case.**


# Helicopter Management, Teal, and Stirring The Soup

We’ve exchanged command and control for coax and manipulate

* * *

#### Get Shift Done: Management

### Helicopter Management, Teal, and Stirring The Soup

#### We’ve exchanged command and control for coax and manipulate

You thought things were political before?

The irony of fostering autonomous and self-organizing teams is that it
eventually negates the need for traditional management. This is a common
pattern observed during re-orgs and “transformations”. Being savvy career-
wise, management tries to adapt and in the process becomes even more spooky
and political. It’s like parents transitioning from command and control to
[helicopter parenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_parent). In
some cases it is downright Orwellian.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*dL_2WWibLJkuIyN14qS7ow.png)

Have you heard of _teal_ organizations? Teal is where it’s at (it is [humbly
referred to](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Teal_Organizations)
as the “next stage in the evolution of human consciousness”). Teal isn’t some
drab Orange:

> The hierarchical “predict and control” pyramid of Orange is replaced with a
decentralized structure consisting of small teams that take responsibility for
their own governance and for how they interact with other parts of the
organization.

Anyway, no one wants to be Orange when there’s something brighter and more
Tealy out there. No one wants to be a mere manager. That’s a dead end gig.
[Sydney Finkelstein writes](http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20150624-the-end-
of-middle-management):

> We should no longer expect traditional job ladders for managers to move up
the ranks, or even retaining the notion that middle managers are the glue that
connects workers and ensures goal alignment up and down the hierarchy.

**Leadership** is the where the action is.

What this means is you’ve got a clusterfuck of people trying to reinvent
themselves as facilitators, mentors, motivators, and, um, leaders. Orange and
Teal mixed to a frothy brown. It’s the same urge — to wield power, expand
influence, and advance career — just now under a [thin veil of Simon Sinek
dulcet tones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4). Throw in the
incessant 1:1 meetings, passive aggressive political posturing, and gag
inducing cultural manifestos, and you’ve got something far more oppressive
than command and control.

My point here isn’t to say that there aren’t better ways of working. I believe
in autonomous, self-organizing teams. I believe in quality facilitation and
mentorship. I believe the front-lines are the best to make decisions, and
should have the data to make those decisions. And I believe the front-lines
should “hire” managers and help when they need it. Above all, and above all
dogmas, what works, works.

But do you notice the degree to which this has all been co-opted? The people
who need to be paying the most attention, and changing their habits the most,
are the folks playing god with the front-lines. They’re stirring the soup and
opaquely tweaking and probing the culture. They’re reading up on systems
thinking and complexity theory on one breath, and then plotting their
ascension in the other. It feels kind of shitty.

This is the environment that many builders, crafters, makers find themselves
in: in organizations caught uncomfortably mid-evolution, half getting it, but
not able to get out of their own way. We’ve exchanged command and control for
coax and manipulate.

The answer is to empower the front-lines to get the work done, coach,
facilitate, and get out the way. And that’s a hard pill for some to swallow.

# Should We Do [ Agile, Kanban, Design Thinking, LeanUX, …]

* * *

### Should We Do [ Agile, Kanban, Design Thinking, LeanUX, …]

Should we DO Design Thinking? Should we DO Lean Startup. Should we DO Agile?
Should we DO LeanUX?

**No. Just DO IT.**

> [](https://twitter.com/practicingdev/status/785986850787725317)

Stop searching for a silver bullet.

Become a student. Get to work. Reflect. Adapt. Roll your own.

I’m profoundly grateful for the work of the Agile community, the tradition of
Lean in all of its various permutations (from TPS, Lean Startup, to Kanban),
and the various design methodologies (e.g. Design Thinking). Because of their
hard work, you — along with some other members of your team — can hit Google,
read some books, maybe hit a conference/class and just DO IT (“it” being some
form of trying things, reflecting, and adapting).

Yeah, you. No degree required. You can probably get started without that $2500
a day course. Put on your thinking (and feeling, and observing) cap and go.

Lest you think you can put everything into neat boxes, read the history of
[Lean Startup](http://www.salimvirani.com/the-history-of-leanstartup-and-how-
to-make-sense-of-it-all/), the [Agile
Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/history.html),
[Agile](http://techbeacon.com/agility-beyond-history%E2%80%94-legacy%E2%80%94
-agile-development), [Kanban for Knowledge Work](http://www.djaa.com/brief-
history-kanban-knowledge-work), and [design
thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking#History). If you trace
back the coining of most “ways” you’ll find people DOING IT out there in the
real world, drawing from multiple traditions to chip away at a problem.
Spotify Method … [Spotify’s engineering team decided to rewrite the rules and
create their own agile methodology](http://reqtest.com/blog/how-spotify-does-
agile-a-look-at-the-spotify-engineering-culture/). XP … Kent Beck’s “[role
expanded as he noted several problems they were having with their development
process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming#Origins).” Lean UX
… [was honed by Jeff Gothelf and his team at The
Ladders](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2011/05/case-study-lean-ux-at-
work.html).

At some point, someone was DOING IT. IT started to work. Manifestos were
written. Then books published and the requisite book tour. Conferences held.
Consulting practices established. Then McConsulting practices. Buzzwords
promulgated. Tweets blasted. The Big 3 Swooped In.

Things got complicated, I get it, but not something a Sunday morning, the
internet, and some coffee can’t handle. You’ve got this!

I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that none of this is rocket
science. The hard work of boiling down the traditions to actionable steps has
already happened. To be in the top 5% you don’t need rocket science. Talk to
any consultant, and they’ll admit that the biggest hurdle is moving past the
political bullshit, incompatible HR policies, silos, soon-to-be obsolete job
responsibilities, and the momentum of the “old way”. Cliche as it sounds, it
is invariably a people problem. And, importantly, having people around who
have either 1) done it or something kind of like it before, or 2) have enough
time to do their homework, and exist in an organization where trying new
things doesn’t carry a huge political risk.

The hard work is ahead of you ([read about Intuits 8 year design thinking
quest](https://hbr.org/2015/01/intuits-ceo-on-building-a-design-driven-
company)). Don’t get paralyzed on methods. That’s the easy stuff. Becoming a
learning organization — capable of inventing and adapting your system — now
that is HARD.

“But, but, but … everyone is worried that IT won’t work! So we need to be
extra sure that IT is what we need. I read that IT sucks. And that IT is the
hot thing.”

Do your homework on these traditions: there’s so much cross-over, borrowing,
and evolution. You’re going to end up with a Franken-Method, so you might as
well embrace that! Anyone who is looking for “the way” has either 1) maxed out
all available options, and is doing swimmingly (file under problems you’d like
to have), or 2) is delusional about the power of “the way”.

So… JUST DO IT.

### 24-Point Checklist for PM/PO Candidates

For a quick post today I thought I’d share a personal checklist for assessing
product management / product owner candidates. These 24 items are useful when
1) thinking about the role you hope to fill, and 2) assessing a candidate. It
can take a lifetime of shipping to max out your chops, so it is important to
view all of these skills on a continuum.

  2. Entrepreneurial spirit
  3. Respect and empathy for crafters, and builders
  4. Respect and empathy non-builders (aka “business”)
  5. Systems thinking
  6. Behavioral economics / cognitive biases, consumer psychology
  7. Facilitation techniques (meetings, activities)
  8. Qualitative research methods
  9. Data analysis, statistics, descriptive/predictive/prescriptive analytics (and requisite technical skills)

# SaaS and the Impostor Clairvoyant PM

Why most estimation, ROI calculations, and heavy upfront planning is a waste
of time in SaaS

* * *

### SaaS and the Impostor Clairvoyant PM

#### Why most estimation, ROI calculations, and heavy upfront planning is a
waste of time in SaaS

This post is about fear and uncertainty, how we respond to that uncertainty,
and how we accidentally perpetuate learned helplessness in software
development.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*gppqlsgZYxHoWPHyuKXDng.png)

<http://lisapapineau.blogspot.com/2012/03/actresses-and-crystal-ball.html>

SaaS products are service touch-points. Customers don’t buy, they rent or pay-
per-use. Adding features to the product cannot be equated to adding features
to a physical product. The feature may be “shipped”, but more accurately you
are establishing a potential value stream in a complex service ecosystem. [To
quote Dave Snowden](http://cognitive-edge.com/blog/safe-the-infantilism-of-
management/), “software development needs to be seen as a service and as an
ecology not as a manufacturing process.” Yet, the vestiges of manufacturing
remain.

Complexity triggers our defense instincts.

We plan. We play planning poker. We estimate. We play “buy a feature” with our
stakeholders. We try to calculate ROI (the cost and reward side). We draw
linear process flows as circles and call them loops. We stoke the feature
factory, crank the velocity, add bullet points to feature lists, and bask in a
false sense of rigor. Output soothes the nerves, albeit temporarily.

As Snowden remarks, “going through a linear process in shorter cycles or
drawing it as a circle does not make it non-linear”. Our challenge is
nonlinear. Therefore, you’re battling a mismatch between the problem space and
the approach. Manufactured Product = linear. Service = nonlinear, complex
adaptive system.

Remarked a developer friend:

> After all the ****ing song and dance with estimates, it is three months
later and no one is using the damn thing. It was shipped and forgotten … on to
the next feature right away. We were 1.2x of estimate, yet the ROI discussed
is tracking at .2 … probably negative if you figure in the technical debt we
were forced to add. We’ll lose money! But hey … we are “predictable”

The reality is that we are not great at predicting/understanding:

  1. how customers will actually use what what we build in their real-world environments
  2. when and what we will learn, and what opportunities may emerge
  3. the emergence of new technologies, changes in competitive landscape, changing usage habits, micro and macro economic trends, evolving customer needs, emergence of new opportunities
  4. how an individual feature will contribute to the overall value of a product from the customer, user, and/or business perspective. Customers are notoriously bad at estimating the value of a proposed enhancement
  5. breadth of usage and growth in breadth of usage over time
  6. the rate with which perceived value will degrade. Today’s delighter is tomorrow’s table stakes feature ([see Kano Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_model))
  7. the actual ongoing cost of adding new functionality (maintenance, support, increase in technical debt, training, complexity, etc.) Upfront engineering costs typically represent a small % of overall cost
  8. the impact of various nonlinear effects caused by increased complexity (for example, doubling team size doesn’t produce 2x outcomes)

But, but, but, but …. we should still try, right?

It’s not worth it. Heavy business cases, ROI calculations, project estimates,
feature estimates, complex prioritization schemes, etc. — all of that upfront
stuff — is mostly useless. They reinforce a linear delivery model mindset and
being able to predict the items above. We might progressively narrow in on an
ROI estimate over time, but solving that puzzle upfront is nearly impossible.

Your best bet is to aim resources at a seemingly valuable problem to solve (or
customer’s job-to-be-done), attempt to continuously deliver value, and hone
your ability to “[sense and
respond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_respond)” based on what
happens. We may not be great at the points above, but we’re better when we
actually observe a response (sense) and respond accordingly. Amplify and
diminish/mute/kill accordingly.

But you need to be able to move quickly, deliver value continuously, learn and
experiment, and fail safely. “Our team can’t do that!” you say. That’s a
problem. When your ability to move and learn quickly is compromised, we are
forced to maniacally protect our resources. We MUST become clairvoyants. We
MUST try to do the impossible and look into our crystal balls and correctly
predict the future of a complex adaptive system (hard/impossible). You can
only do that when your horizon is very short, and you are moving quickly.

We then have a self-fulfilling prophecy … because we’re weak, we impose a way
of working that discourages ever becoming good at our weakness! The feature
Tetris / factory starts up, and your team never learns how to iterate and
progressively add value to a value stream. Worst of all, teams become overly
reliant on receiving a prescriptive idea/solution vs. aggressively tackling a
problem to solve, failing, and learning.

And that’s where I’ll stop for the day. Are your planning and estimation
efforts actually adding value? Do they “work” (outside of assuaging internal
fears, and aligning everyone’s cognitive biases)? Are they _really _necessary?
If you’re firing on all cylinders and doing all that stuff, well awesome! If
not, is this a chicken and egg problem?

### PMs: How To Make Sure You Aren’t Wasting Everyone’s Time

Product managers, here’s an easy way to see if you are wasting your own time,
and the time of the people around you. First, buy a watch so you don’t get
distracted by screens whenever you have to know the time.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*74Y05eVGrXYfMBbe5wCkrw.png)

Next, ask yourself “**what am I _REALLY_ doing?**” This can be harder than it
sounds, but go figure it out.

Then ask …

Does [that thing you’re doing] help **your team** (and the **individuals on
your team, _you included_**):

  1. [Build trust and reduce fear](https://www.infoq.com/articles/modern-agile-intro)? (see also [here](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/))
  2. Make it [safer to experiment](http://cognitive-edge.com/methods/safe-to-fail-probes/) and move with conviction and speed?
  3. [Achieve a flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29)?
  4. Leverage their diverse perspectives, habits, and quirks for mutual benefit?
  5. Work through conflict and become stronger?
  6. See the impact (and feel pride) in their work?
  7. Continuously deliver[ validated value (outcomes)](http://blog.leandog.com/2015/12/ux-design-peopes-over-output/)to your customers and organization?
  8. Add [as little as possible](https://www.agileconnection.com/article/art-maximizing-work-not-done) to your product for the greatest validated impact?
  9. Learn more about your users/customers/organization/larger ecosystem?
  10. Accelerate the rate of meaningful feedback and the ability to act on that feedback?
  11. Build a rich shared understanding applicable to the challenge at hand?
  12. Practice their [sensemaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensemaking) skills?
  13. Discover new opportunities to deliver value as they emerge?
  14. Think beyond incremental changes? Think big and shoot high?
  15. Reflect on what is and isn’t working and continuously improve?
  16. Hone their craft and branch out professionally?
  17. Work sustainably, with fewer fire-drills?
  18. Eliminate unhelpful dependencies and process, especially when rooted in mistrust and fear? Dampen the musty stink of internal politics, cognitive dissonance, and “just because”ism?
  19. Have fun and laugh?

What did you come up with?

**No. None of that!** Then you can stop doing that. See, that wasn’t hard! Do something else.

**Yes and No. I’m worried it has some positives, but also some undesirable side effects. **Figure that out. Take your hesitation seriously. Your behavior may not be safe.

**By golly yes!** Rock on. Keep it up, and reflect on whether it’s working with your team.

### 10 Ways UX Research Is Changing

How is UX Research evolving with the times, especially given approaches like
LeanUX that favor fewer handoffs, more participation, and more
experimentation?

It is Sunday, and the listicle (and doodle) instinct is strong ….

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*srLo60TVu2IaQWn3KcBJfg.jpeg)

See #1, #2, and #4 below …

  1. **Pull based, just-in-time research**. Spending weeks and months accumulating research is an accident waiting to happen. The environment is constantly changing. The danger of accumulating research inventory is that it is constantly _depreciating_. A small change in direction can render it stale and useless. Yes research takes time, but it is best to start at the [last responsible moment](https://dzone.com/articles/lean-tools-last-responsible). The ultimate just-in-time approach is to resist trying to “get ahead” of the work altogether and wait until there is capacity and time to start alongside the team. 80% of the value can be delivered quickly, and you’ll have 100% of the current context. What you find in many companies is a strange sort of neurotic design team driven shotgun research approach. They’re terrified they’ll get caught on the back foot or blow their “[seat at the table](http://firstround.com/review/How-Designers-Can-Earn-a-Seat-at-the-Table-2/)”, so they undertake all sorts of pre-emptive research that fails to ever synchronize effectively with front-line teams.
  2. Research is **validated continuously**. Is the research informing actual product decisions? I’m not talking assumptions — like putting one thing earlier/later in a roadmap, an ooh-ahh session for a two-year mobile plan, or a slicker kick-off deck — I’m talking about actual decisions on what was designed, built, and validated (customer-delivered value). Did your research findings hold water when validated out in the real world, with real data, and real customers? It’s ironic that to support Agile product development teams, UX Research is frequently asked to work in a waterfall model. Don’t delay validating your work. Which brings us to …
  3. **Less linear product development process**. Look at any antiquated graphic of the product development process and you’ll see a big block for Design Research. That block exists **TO THE LEFT **of when developers start to write code. UX Research for modern software products is still heavily entrenched in practices that fit more appropriately with hard-goods, and agency-orchestrated product development. Learning is happening all of the time, and UX Research will always be pivotal in the learning process. We’re moving from project-based research to continuous learning.
  4. **Less research in a vacuum**. Take teams along for your learning journey and invite them to participate in activities. Share findings frequently and incorporate feedback. Regularly “synchronize” and reality check your progress. Build empathy by connecting teams directly with customers instead of presenting your findings as reports or briefs. In this model you play the expert, guide, and fellow learner.
  5. **Facilitation**. To support #4, you’ll need to become skilled at facilitating various activities with cross-functional teams. Most researchers I know are extremely good at relating to people. But they can be severely challenged when it comes to working with engineers and internal teams. It is easy to become beholden to your research, and approach the work from the standpoint of a missionary vs. a guide and coach. Study up on facilitation skills. Get to know the developer and product manager mindsets …
  6. **Lightweight presentations**. Since teams are involved directly in the research, it is less common to be producing slick presentations. It used to be that you’d find yourself in the spotlight rarely (and the research was a many month effort), so you needed to make it count. The goal is to communicate learnings, and since the learnings spend less time in “inventory” (see #2 above), there are fewer learnings to communicate in any single shot. Succinctly answer the questions that matter now. Less fluff.
  7. **Using both quantitative and qualitative data. **Teams expect researchers to use all of the data at their disposal, and these days (if you’re lucky) you’ll have access to a significant amount of quantitative data. What do your users actually do in your product? How do they navigate in the real world? What key features differentiate the population you’re studying? How can we augment personas (or jobs-to-be-done profiles) with actual data? What predicts low/high NPS? Are these really the “top tasks”? Gone are the days when the most a researcher would graph/analyze were the results of a five person usability test. I’d venture to say that the qualitative vs. quantitative schism is a non-issue. The two feed seamlessly into each other. To tell a good story and engage teams you need both.
  8. **Experiment Design**. As a researcher, your job isn’t relegated to pre-work, benchmarking, reviewing historical data for insights, and making a take-it-or-leave-it recommendation. You’ll be frequently involved in a dynamic work in progress, A/B tests, triaging feedback from newly released experiments, and validating your own research assumptions in real-time. Experiment-design becomes part of the tool chest. This doesn’t mean that everything needs to be a rigorous, by the book, ready for a scientific journal experiment, but you can’t waste the team’s time.
  9. **A bigger research library to manage**. With the large amount of data available, you’re going to build a big war chest of raw data, information, and insights/knowledge. Data is coming in from various sources, and you have to organize it and make it accessible. Sure you can leverage tools, but there’s still a role for the librarian … especially when the library is big.
  10. **Evolving role of product managers**. I’ve written about [how product management is evolving](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/the-evolving-product-manager-role-6f288bbc3cda#.ol9l8038g), and the [many overlaps these days in product development](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/the-overlap-puxeng-56dcfd33875b#.bxs6hy54s). This draws the UX Researcher into the fray. For one, UX becomes an embedded team member, so you have your people in the fray, and you must support them. There’s less of a buffer. But I’m increasingly seeing that product managers are coming around to respect the various techniques used by UX Research. I’ve heard PMs say things like “so THAT’s how you do an interview!” or “these methods are not in my skill set, but I’m finding them incredibly helpful!” There’s a growing respect and overlap.

  1. We can predict the future
  2. We can impersonate our customers
  3. The customer with the failed usability test is not representative
  4. The customer who loves the new feature is representative
  5. We’ll come back to it in a couple months
  6. Our roadmaps will remain accurate for more than a month
  7. The story is ready to be estimated as is
  8. No news from QA is good news
  9. By default, the team will feel comfortable giving you constructive feedback
  10. The customer will eagerly adopt the new feature
  11. Doubling the team size will double the output
  12. Apps are dead. The desktop is dead. Responsive is dead. [ — — — — ] is dead
  13. Sales understands how to sell the new feature
  14. We understand how to sell the new feature
  15. Product complexity scales linearly with number of personas serviced
  16. Eventually we’ll be able to leverage all of this data!

UPDATES (From comments)

41\. If we build it, they will come

42\. Sales doesn’t know what the customer wants

43\. An unhappy customer is just “the wrong type of customer”; we didn’t build
it for them anyway…

44\. There’s _nothing_ else we can do until we get a response on ________.
(best way to give yourself the break you earned! :D)

45\. We’ll release n-features on X-date!

46\. It’s easy, we don’t need any FAQs/documentation.

47\. It’s obvious, we don’t need user testing.

48\. There are a lot of things users don’t like. Rather than fixing each one,
we should just re-architect it.

### Your Saas Company Is Like a Theme Park

I’ve been toying with metaphors for a SaaS company. The more I mull it over,
the more SaaS companies start looking like service companies (or “experience
companies”). Products are touchpoints, and the whole complex system is
evolving and changing. Traditional product discovery methods aren’t well
suited to the non-linear nature of the system.

How about a Theme Park?

### 50 Questions I Ask PMs About Data and Their Teams

In my coaching work, I end up talking to lots of product development teams
about data, KPIs, running experiments, and “measuring the team”. People are
looking for the silver bullet:

> I’m also wondering if you’ve seen any good solutions to the product KPI
problem in general

My response is a typical, befuddled “it depends”. Why does it depend? I’ve yet
to find a one-size-fits-all solution. Goals vary. Products vary. Cultures
vary. Skills vary. The scope for possible actions vary. At at the end of the
day, cultivating a learning culture (a prerequisite in my mind for the
responsible use of data) isn’t something you install. That’s the blocker … not
some tool, technique, or having access to a data scientist.

Here is my backup list of questions I use when doing interviews and gathering
“data” on an organization before making any recommendations.

Use ’em if they’re helpful. Look before you leap, and gauge the organization’s
DNA. Then start the experimentation…

  1. How open is your culture to disconfirming information? Is it welcomed or fought? What would be the path from that disconfirming insight to an actual change in direction?
  2. Trying new ways of using evidence and data to drive decisions can be risky. Mistakes are common. How safe is your environment for teams that might make the occasional mistake in their quest to make better decisions?
  3. When it comes to using evidence to drive better product decisions, what’s working? Why is it working?
  4. Describe something new you have learned about your customers in the last two months. How did that learning come about?
  5. Describe a current blind spot. What do you know you _don’t know_? What might you accomplish if you could learn more in this area? What would you ask a crystal ball?
  6. Could you describe a recent ad-hoc report or analysis you generated? What questions were you hoping to answer, and what decisions were you hoping to inform? Can you tell me more about how you actually gathered, cleaned, and analyzed the data?
  7. Are you required to deliver regular reports to other parts of the organization? What do they look like? How frequently do you prepare these reports?
  8. Moving beyond the pros and cons of individual decisions, how does your team reflect on the quality of your product development decision making process?
  9. Describe some recurring decisions you must make, and how you leverage data to make those decisions.
  10. What does being “data-driven” actually mean to you? What is the opposite of being data-driven? Can an organization be customer-driven AND data-driven?
  11. If your teams could get faster feedback, what might that let them do? What type of feedback would drive these actions?
  12. Who is involved in your business intelligence efforts? Who do they report to? Who thinks about the big picture and handles cross-functional / cross departmental needs?
  13. Words like data, business intelligence, data science, analytics, insights, experimentation, and learning are thrown around often. Can you describe your personal mental model?
  14. How do your teams handle and explore ambiguity?
  15. Can you describe insights that exist elsewhere in your organization that are logistically difficult to incorporate/integrate with your product data? Why does this silo exist?
  16. “Fail fast” is one of those buzzwords we hear often. It inspires many reactions. What’s your reaction?
  17. What was your last flop? How did you figure out it was a flop? How long did you know it was heading in that direction?
  18. People often speak about “wrangling” data. Can you describe some recent struggles with getting data into a state suitable for analysis?
  19. How is decision making distributed across your organization? When the Why for a particular decision involves data and evidence, how is that communicated?
  20. An engineer once asked me if there were “passing tests” for product managers. From the PMs perspective, how would you describe the “passing tests” for your work?
  21. What are some common adoption patterns for new features in your product? What dictates the uptake?
  22. How do you go about understanding the impact of newly shipped features?
  23. What can’t data tell you? What are some of the intangibles that are driving your product decisions?
  24. Who has access to your product data? How do they access that product data? If they produce some sort of insight — a graph, a dashboard, a report, an analysis, etc. — how do they share that internally?
  25. Some common themes associated with data include: control, learning, efficiency, resourcing, performance management (measuring people), and innovation. What’s at the heart of your efforts? What’s your motivation? What will become possible?
  26. Do you have monitors in the office with product metrics? Or a dashboard that is widely and passionately consumed? What’s on it? What’s the story on how that dashboard came to be?
  27. What is your current weak-spot in terms of using data and evidence to drive better outcomes? Where is there friction and hiccups? What’s stopping progress?
  28. Describe some of the longer term trends in your product. What have you been tracking for some length of time? When will it reach an inflection point?
  29. How do your teams leverage existing product data during the design process? Can you describe a recent design decision that was informed by benchmark data and insights?
  30. How might someone internally get a quick snapshot of your product’s health? How would you know if something was going wrong, especially if it was a longer term trend that might not be immediately apparent.
  31. Does your team trust the data it has? When is trust lacking? Where is there confidence?
  32. How has data and measurement been inadvertently abused in your organization?
  33. How do teams share their insights? Where would I go to learn about recent learnings?
  34. If presented with data showing poor adoption or that the work was not driving the desired outcome, what action might your team take? Who would make that decision?
  35. Who is the most data-savvy person you work with? What can they do that others cannot do?
  36. The word “experiment” can mean different things to do different people — especially in the business context. What does it mean to you? Can you give some examples from your organization?
  37. Sometimes it is OK to guess. Other times, not so much. Describe a recent situation where it was decidedly NOT ok to guess, and explain how you went about gathering the facts.
  38. Describe a metric you refer to on a daily or weekly basis. What does it mean? Why is it important?
  39. Can you give a recent example of a situation where your team’s intuition was proven wrong? How did that unfold?
  40. The “intuition vs. data” debate is a frequent one. Have you observed this in your organization? How did it play out?
  41. How is your personal performance measured?
  42. In your opinion, what makes a product successful?
  43. In your opinion, what are the traits of a high-performing product development team?
  44. What are you thoughts on the phrase “learning organization”? How do you personally balance learning and execution?
  45. What leeway do your teams have for shipping, analyzing the data, and acting on that information before taking on new work? How quickly are they called on to the next task?
  46. How do you segment your customers and users? Who uses these segments internally? How does your segmentation scheme manifest in how you work, prioritize work, make decisions, etc.?
  47. What traits do your most valuable customers have? How do you prioritize your customer success and customer support efforts when in a pinch?
  48. What are the signs that a customer is embracing your product? What are some signs that a customer is having trouble embracing your product, and may be at risk of churning? How does the information get funneled to your product development teams?
  49. How does your team know it is doing a good job?
  50. Teams take a lot of satisfaction in seeing the impact of their work. How do you show your teams that their work made a difference?
  51. What are some of the key things you consider when prioritizing items in your backlog/roadmap? How does data figure into your prioritization efforts?


# Acute vs. Chronic Product Issues

### Acute vs. Chronic Product Issues

In his post [**Normalization of deviance in software: how broken practices
become standard**](http://danluu.com/wat/)**, **Dan Luu** **makes an
interesting point about postmortems:

> If there were an acute failure, you might see a postmortem, but while we’ll
do postmortems for “the site was down for 30 seconds”, we rarely do
postmortems for “this takes 10x as much ops effort as the alternative and it’s
a death by a thousand papercuts”, “we architected this thing poorly and now
it’s very difficult to make changes that ought to be trivial”, or “a
competitor of ours was able to accomplish the same thing with an order of
magnitude less effort”.

It’s a great post — I highly recommend it — but this section in particular
struck a chord with me. We tend to discuss and analyze our acute failures and
celebrate our big wins, but rarely find a way to constructively discuss our
chronic challenges and areas of barely acceptable mediocrity.

It’s like someone delaying dealing with a chronic health issue (or a screwed
up relationship or work situation), but promptly visiting the ER when
something “bad” happens.

A friend echoed a similar situation in their organization:

> Somehow we persuaded ourselves it was OK to work with the broken
architecture. We’d churn features out. Have little parties. Pat each other on
the back for a job well done, even if we didn’t know if the work was actually
successful. And just turn a blind eye. Anyone who tried to push for change was
simply marginalized, and singled out as not being a team player

In Lean you have the concept of a stop-the-line culture ([pulling the Andon
chord](http://www.shmula.com/about-peter-abilla/what-is-andon-in-the-toyota-
production-system/)). Here was a person doing just that — developers were
struggling due to the architecture — but she was marginalized for speaking up.
Now, this wasn’t a critical issue. The lights were on, and the product was
accessible. But this kind of stuff adds up. The same goes for delivering
mediocre features, letting UX debt accumulate, letting learning/cognitive debt
accumulate, or allowing toxic behavior. You can celebrate your wins all you
want, but it doesn’t make this stuff go away (or make discussing it safer).

In this particular situation there were a couple interrelated problems:

  1. A feel-good, harmony focused culture. Talking about chronic problems was frowned upon (vs. acute issues that could be addressed immediately). Most cultures (not just feel-good cultures) find that discussing chronic, wicked problems is difficult for both managers and the front-lines. Typically, they are bigger and require more resources to address
  2. Let’s assume that management had very good reasons why they couldn’t address this issue … if they did, they weren’t discussing them. This lack of communication and acknowledgment was toxic
  3. New developers assumed this was just how it worked
  4. More experienced developers didn’t see an upside in calling out the issue repeatedly because of #1
  5. Because of #2, there was no basis for a straightforward discussion on what might trigger a response. IOW, how bad would it need to get before acting? How would you measure that?

So what can you do?

Luu [cites a couple recommendations from a study detailing normalization of
deviance in
healthcare](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2821100/):

> Pay attention to weak signals

> Resist the urge to be unreasonably optimistic

> Teach employees how to conduct emotionally uncomfortable conversations

> System operators need to feel safe in speaking up

> Realize that oversight and monitoring are never-ending

All of this advice applies for software. If you accept the new normal as
normal … then you quickly lose the fire for addressing the chronic issues.
They multiply. And suddenly you are struggling with the non-linear effects of
those issues. While retros and postmortems target the acute issues that
account for 20% of your hurt, you are stifled by the chronic issues accounting
for 80% of your hurt.

You might not be able to address the problem immediately, but you must
encourage your teams to monitor the issue without discounting their
frustration. For example, developers could cut new tickets each time they had
to work around the finicky architecture, or use product usage metrics to
indicate the impact of UX debt.

Anyway. [Check out Luu’s post.](http://danluu.com/wat/) It’s good. And think
about how you can make your environment safer for monitoring and discussing
chronic issues.


# Cutting Corners and Electric Fences

Your team ships a new feature. Something is not right.

* * *

### Cutting Corners and Electric Fences

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*0wdqFy2-c9zCBobJVoxZSQ.png)

<http://www.grit.com/animals/electric-fencing-basics>

Your team ships a new feature. Something is not right.

You’re worried about the test and monitoring/analytics coverage. The
developers weren’t able to refactor some crappy code, which made things take
longer. The uptake isn’t what you expected, and it looks like users are
struggling with the workflow (but you having trouble parsing the details,
because of the poor monitoring). It feels shoddy, and as someone who cares
about doing good work this bothers you. The ensuing success theater — with
sales and marketing in full pitch and sell mode — just makes things worse. It
starts to gnaw on you and you find yourself being uncharacteristically testy.
Someone has to say something, right?

Tactfully, you mention your concerns during a 1:1 chat with a manager. It
doesn’t go well. She responds:

> We can’t be perfectionists! We have to get stuff out there and be _Agile_.
Sales is killing it with this! Users might be struggling, but let’s be honest,
they’re not our customers. They don’t pay our bills. We also have a great
support team to smooth things over. All I’m asking here is that you focus on
what you can control, and on being a team player. I’ve noticed you being more
negative lately. I bet the team doesn’t appreciate that! They worked hard on
this. They might think you’re undermining their work. Be careful …

Biting your lip, you mull things over in your mind. That’s a lot to process.
The conversation feels manipulative on many levels, but perhaps you’re not
seeing something. You know that’s not the definition of Agility, but that’s
the least of your concerns. The questions flow: Was the work in vain? Am I
just naive? Are my standards too high? Is it better to just go with the flow?
Maybe she knows something I don’t know?

You think about your significant other and your apartment in the Bay. The
company isn’t burning, and you’ll likely have this job for at least the next
couple years. It is decently fun, the people are nice, and there’s a chance
things might work out.

Does she know something you don’t know? That last question inspires you:

> Thanks for the, err, advice. I appreciate it. I understand that at times we
need to cut corners. It would just help, to, you know, feel like there was a
good reason we were cutting those corners. Like there was an upside. Or at
least to be transparent about the risks we’re taking. We’re making a bet that
it doesn’t matter, for now. We’re making a bet that we don’t need to do our
best work, and that this will pay off in the future. Let’s at least make that
explicit. I’m willing to roll with it. How will we know when it is the
right/wrong bet to make?

There’s a pause. Now put yourself in the shoes of the manager. Someone is
asking her to:

  1. admit that the best work is not happening
  2. admit that this is impacting someone who cares, and
  3. be explicit about risk, and agree to be called out on her decisions at some point in the future.

And all the while she is likely dealing with the same cognitive dissonance
from her boss, and her boss’s boss.

It’s like asking someone to acknowledge that:

  1. smoking is not the best choice
  2. second hand smoke is harmful to friends and family
  3. they’re making a calculated decision that not quitting now will serve some future good for everyone

Based on my chats with my mom (a smoker of 60 years), that doesn’t work. The
response is predictable: defensive, dismissive, mildly threatening, and brief.
Meeting (or lunch with mom) over.

* * *

I’ve fallen for this trap dozens of times. It _ALMOST NEVER_ works. You’re not
going to get the clarity you’re hoping for. Sure you’ll get clarity about
everything else — what’s in the backlog, sales numbers, the fancy methodology
you’ll be adopting, your managers plans, etc. — but you won’t get the level of
transparency and vulnerability you desire. [Larman’s Laws of Organizational
Behavior](http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/index.php?title=Larman%27s_Laws_of_Organizational_Behavior)
gives us some clues. The third point especially:

> any change initiative will be derided as “purist”, “theoretical”,
“revolutionary”, “religion”, and “needing pragmatic customization for local
concerns” — which deflects from addressing weaknesses and manager/specialist
status quo.

Now, it is easy to make this about middle management. Often, however, they are
merely _caught in the middle_. They’d love to have good answers for you, but
the strategy they’re getting is equally as obtuse. To Craig Larman’s point,
handling these wicked problems typically triggers a litany of arguments meant
to basically shut you up and calm the cognitive dissonance (theirs and yours).
These talks literally hurt the manager’s head and make them feel helpless and
out of control.

So what do you do as someone who cares and wants to do great work?

To fight this battle, you’re going to need to be quiet and carefully observe.

  * Where is the invisible border management has created around continuous improvement? I like to call this the electric fence: the border that seems to trigger the defensive reaction. Even organizations that pride themselves on “radical candor” have these fences scattered around
  * What issues come up over and over, but somehow always trigger the localized “pragmatic” response? Check annual surveys, retros, and post-mortems. What do people keep bringing up, but simply stop complaining about?
  * What is your organization optimized for at the moment? Draw out the system
  * What is the _real _culture as [evidenced by actions](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/company-culture-is-44592c36958c), not words?

After you’ve observed for a while, ask yourself the hard question. Are you
ever going to do your best work in your current role? Change rarely happens
because one person goes on a mission. Canaries die (that’s the point). Is this
a place where you can be challenged, and feel like you’re doing great work?

Still willing to give this place a chance?.

  * Don’t waste time having conversations with people who will be paralyzed by discomfort. Instead, focus on how to create safe situations where people can talk about this stuff without tripping the electric fence and causing defensiveness. Achieve that first, then have the conversations that matter. If you find yourself in a spokesperson role without other advocates at your side, you are likely going to fail
  * Visualize impacts, don’t talk about impacts with generalities. Basically … show, don’t tell
  * Talk about your own needs (e.g. “I have a need for more rigor here”) vs. grafting your needs onto the rest of the team, or speaking generally about a fucked up situation. Speaking generally fires the stress response
  * Consider that we often focus on the corners we cut, because there is nothing positive happening to counteract that crappy feeling. These are two distinct problems: 1) things are awesome because we’re cutting corners, but we’ll pay for it later, and 2) we are cutting corners now, and things are not awesome. Both are challenging, and attract a different response from those on the front-lines. In most cases, someone is aware that corners are being cut. The danger of things being awesome, is that we discount those cut-corners altogether. When we’re craving awesome, we make up all sorts of excuses why it’s necessary to cut corners (without admitting that we’re in this mess because of prior corners cut). So both are dangerous.
  * Try to take the emotional sting out of the word “bet” and use it! _Bet _is an interesting word. In a safe to fail environment we are free to make bets, including those that might involve cutting some corners. In a culture of fear, the idea that you’re betting the company’s money by doing less-than-great work is not to be discussed. Socialize the word “bet” in a safe way so that it has the potential for changing the mindset
  * Set an example. You aren’t going to get that manager to be transparent about their calculus. But you can discuss your own bets, and be humble when things don’t pan out

The big point here is that in these situations it is not just about speaking
up. The reaction you trigger can often circumvent your cause. By all means
encourage an environment where uncomfortable and challenging discussions can
happen. Encourage safety. But realize that candor alone wont destroy those
electric fences. That may take more time, and more strategy. Or you simply
finding another place to work.


# Case Study: From The Front Lines

Keeping people in the loop without it sucking

### Case Study: From The Front Lines

#### Keeping people in the loop without it sucking

How do you give big picture visibility to 12+ individual teams (100+ devs, UX,
PMs, Agile Coaches, etc.) without stepping on people’s time, or instituting
stuffy process? Below I share how I tackled this problem with decent results.
Perhaps it can inspire an experiment within your large product development
organization.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*xBQpQAnUHrV6Ro3bdJsumw.jpeg)

#FTFL … blurred for confidentiality reasons, which has scaled to 20+ teams

#### **Organization**

Large, B2B SaaS organization

#### **The Problem**

  * **Visibility**. Teams had low visibility about what was happening across the product development org. This meant that the people who might have some helpful information to share — “hey, I know about that part of the codebase” or “I have some helpful customer data about that” — had no trigger to share that information
  * **Second Hand Information**. Product managers were tasked with reviewing the full near-term roadmap with their teams. Engineers found this to be a waste of time. I’m not sure if it was the timing, or the content (the information was secondhand), but it didn’t work, and some teams stopped the ritual
  * **Celebrate Wins**. While teams would ring gongs to celebrate a success, it was hard to keep track of the wins across the org. Teams periodically shared updates in lunch-and-learns (which was awesome), but time constraints limited the frequency of these meetings
  * **Management skeptical / resistant** I briefly tried having an epic-focused Kanban board. Management was highly resistant of any kind of work visualization spanning all teams. Their argument was that extra process might diminish team autonomy (very justified), and that visualizing the upstream “team tetris” (assigning epics to teams) might turn contentious (which it did, largely because teams did not choose their epics, and there were frequent team changes). Their concerns were valid

#### **Experiment Criteria**

I was pretty skeptical about having an impact. Previous efforts to make work
visible — with a single epic board, for example — were unsuccessful. People
were sensitive about wasting team time. No one cared for “Status Checks”… it
wasn’t that kind of culture (that’s good in my book). Teams didn’t have access
to the roadmap tool. So I knew whatever I tried needed to be:

  * Relevant
  * Be first-hand: come directly from the people on the front-lines
  * Easy and fast to update
  * Easy and fast to read
  * Not objectionable or threatening in any way to management
  * Not require an extra login

#### **The Experiment**

I nominated a “correspondent” on each team. I focused on developers because
they were closest to the actual work, and I wanted the content to be relevant.
I posed these guidelines:

  * This is an experiment that will likely fail, but I value your help
  * We’ll do this every other Wednesday. I’ll remind you on Mondays
  * You are the correspondent. I want the story “from the front lines”
  * The story shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes to write. Full stop! We are talking 1–3 tweets total. Not a book
  * This isn’t a status check. You can mention inane things, odd things, technical challenges, failures, new team additions … anything
  * The compiled version will take no longer than 8 minutes to read. The goal is to waste NO time
  * This is a purely voluntary role. If you get sick of it, you can pass it along
  * If you had no update (no delta from the previous post), just put “no update”

#### **First Try**

I created a Google doc with a slot for each team update, and shared it with
everyone. To my surprise, people played along. The updates came streaming in.
I needed to gently remind a couple people, but they thanked me sincerely for
the reminder. When they were done I scrambled for a title. The first thing
that came to mind was “From The Front Lines #FTFL”. I later found out what
#FTFL actually meant, but it was too late.

Title in place, I PDFed the thing. For some reason I thought it would be
easier to process (and focus) if it was a PDF. I also wanted to make it
printable. After putting it in a shared folder, I sent a quick email/Slack
blast. #FTFL1 was born!

#### **Feedback**

The feedback was (mostly) positive. A middle manager claimed it “wasn’t
scalable” to which one of the correspondents replied that “the old way wasn’t
scalable either, so this is worth a try.” Product Management felt stepped on.
They wanted to communicate status and felt uncomfortable. They grumbled. But
the overwhelming feedback was positive, and it was game on. We kept it up.
Correspondents would rotate. The issues kept rolling. It read like a community
newsletter with quick, accessible blurbs that made you feel closer to the
teams.

It was heartwarming to see the response among those on the front-lines and
other folks in the org. Two conversations in particular stood out. The first,
when the CTO thanked me for putting it together. Apparently, it allowed him to
briefly scan what was happening. The second, when a senior remote employee
(one of the first hires at the company) thanked me. It brought him closer to
the teams and areas where he could help. I never heard from middle-management,
but that’s another story.

A couple days before I left the company I “handed it over” to my good friend
Sarah, hoping the tradition would be kept alive.

#### **Update**

I learned recently that it is still going, almost 16 months after I started
it, and 12 months after I left the company. The basic format was still in
place — PDF, printed, separated by team — though UX had taken a stab at
beautification. How unexpected and cool! How many times do people complain
about “not seeing the big picture”, try some kind of “update” scheme, and the
whole thing falls apart? All the time, at least in my experience. So this was
a team effort, and a win.

I think this worked for two key reasons:

  * Our heart was in the right place. This wasn’t a status update for management. The goal was to create something valuable for the front-lines, not waste their time
  * We respected people’s time — both the readers and the writers
  * It was a bottom-up effort, and participation was voluntary

Who knows. It might fade away, but it was a fun thing to be part of. Give it a
try! If you’d like to chat about how to set this up in your org, just drop me

# Visualizing Debt, Rework, Cut Corners, and Frustration

Making the invisible visible lets you inspect and adapt

* * *

### Visualizing Debt, Rework, Cut Corners, and Frustration

#### Making the invisible visible lets you inspect and adapt

Your team is cranking through stories and hits a wall. Perhaps you’ve hit an
area of technical or UX debt. Or you’ve encountered a learning void and the
customer need is unclear. The going gets tougher. This is perfectly normal …
we’ve all been there.

A single story can involve a good deal of “work”: rework, working around
technical debt, research, usability testing, and experimentation. These tasks
exist on a customer-value spectrum. Research very much contributes to customer
value (your customers would be psyched to see you learning more about their
needs). Working around technical debt that you’ve continuously kicked down the
road … not so much. What we DON’T work on is also important. Suppose you cut
some corners to deliver early, all the while knowing you’ve delivered
something brittle and in need of eventual improvement?

Again, all of this is perfectly normal. We intuitively know we’re adding risk,
cutting corners, and working in less than ideal ways. Trouble starts to brew
when you stop reflecting and learning (see my post [Cutting Corners and
Electric Fences](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/cutting-corners-and-electric-
fences-c8fbfaa4d91a)). The trick is to visualize the impact.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*uyGVPNpn8GJ6EigIU6o6Kg.png)

  1. If an engineer is battling technical debt to finish a story, then cut a ticket for that work
  2. If you ship a feature with obvious UX debt, then cut a ticket for this debt
  3. If research is required because no data existed, cut a ticket
  4. Is the work not contributing to customer value, but needs to happen? Cut a ticket
  5. Did you rush to get a story out and then need to play whack-a-mole with bugs? Cut a ticket
  6. Have you failed to validate the impact of a story? Cut a ticket for the research
  7. You get the idea. You’re creating more work, doing rework, cutting corners, punting, working around something …. doing something feels a little less than awesome. Cut a ticket.

I know, I know … that’s a ton of tickets. But without the ability to visualize
the work, waste, and rework, it can be difficult to reflect on that work,
waste, and rework. In my experience, this is inherently uncomfortable for
teams. We’re used to managers bullying us for estimates, measuring teams by
looking at velocity (not outcomes), getting scoffed at for mentioning
technical and UX debt, and being told to “be a team player” and accept shoddy
work. That’s NOT ok, and it insults teams. Our gut response is “no more
tickets”.

True story. I remember talking to a CTO who did a lot of rework / refactoring
“out of band” (not represented by tickets) just to avoid the scrutiny of the
product team and CEO. Meanwhile, the CEO was wondering why progress was so
slow. How dysfunctional!

Turn it around….

Instead, consider a radical approach for quantifying impact. More tickets.
More details. More awareness on the part of the team. More diligence in
documenting areas of debt. More safety, trust, and reflection. Less low level
“why doesn’t anyone see what I see” stress. At the end of the day, most
knowledge workers have a good radar. Engage that to make the invisible
visible.

### 12 Signs You’re Working in a Feature Factory

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1800/1*A9HaI7x2MdvkTn48D9a0wg.jpeg)

I’ve used the term _Feature Factory _at a couple conference talks over the
past two years. I started using the term when a software developer friend
complained that he was “just sitting in the factory, cranking out features,
and sending them down the line.”

How do you know if you’re working in a feature factory?

  1. **No measurement**. Teams do not measure the impact of their work. Or, if measurement happens, it is done in isolation by the product management team and selectively shared. You have no idea if your work worked
  2. **Rapid shuffling of teams** and projects (aka Team Tetris). Instead of compelling missions or initiatives, teams deal in feature and project assignments. Chronic multitasking and over-utilization
  3. [**Success theater**](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/success-theater-b60a1666fe67#.5zjj95jy4) around “shipping” with little discussion about impact. You can tell a great deal about an organization by what it celebrates
  4. **Infrequent (acknowledged) failures** and scrapped work. No removed features. Primary measure of success is delivered features, not delivered outcomes. Work is rarely discarded in light of data and learning. Often the team lacks the prerequisite safety to admit misfires
  5. **No connection to core metrics**. Infrequent discussions about desired customer and business outcomes. Team cannot connect work to key business and customer satisfaction metrics. Impossible to connect iterations to “what matters most”
  6. **No PM retrospectives**. Product managers do not conduct regular retrospectives on the quality of their product decisions and compare expected benefits to actual benefits. Developers have “passing tests”, but product managers do not. Product managers view velocity and output as their key performance indicator
  7. **Obsessing about prioritization**. Mismatch between prioritization rigor (deciding what gets worked on) and validation rigor (deciding if it was, in fact, the right thing to work on). Prioritization rigor is designed exclusively to temper internal agendas so that people “feel confident”. Lots of work goes into determining which ideas to work on, leaving little leeway for adjustments and improvisation based on data. **Roadmaps show a list of features**, not areas of focus and/or outcomes
  8. **No tweaking**. Once work is “done”, the team moves immediately on to the next “project”, leaving no time to iterate based on qualitative and quantitative data
  9. **Culture of hand-offs**. Front-loaded process in place to “get ahead of the work” so that items are “ready for engineering”. Team is not directly involved in research, problem exploration, or experimentation and validation. Once work is shipped, team has little contact with support, customer success, and sales
  10. **Large batches**. Without the mandate to experiment, features are delivered in single large batches instead of delivering incrementally. You might still work in sprints (yay, we’re “Agile”), but nothing new is reaching customers at the conclusion of each sprint
  11. **Chasing upfront revenue.** Features are implemented to close new deals. While not inherently wrong, the economic justifications are often flimsy (at best), and fail to account for the non-linear increase in product complexity (you make the quarter, but you pay for it many times over later). Again, this reinforces the idea that features are the unit of value measurement. Product decisions lack a sound economic grounding
  12. **Shiny objects**. Low visibility for refactoring work and debt work-down. Low visibility for overall value delivery capabilities. As mentioned, primary measure of success is new feature output. Little appreciation for the health of the whole product as opposed to shiny new objects. Little awareness around impact of new features on usability (and maintainability and extensibility) of existing product

# Success Theater …

I recently posted about Feature Factories ,which got me thinking about success
theater.

### **Success Theater …**

I recently posted about [Feature Factories](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-
youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2#.kjhkgs7aj) ,which got me
thinking about success theater.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*yTlYkteVv_rV8wXqCY6Kmg.png)

Up and to the right …

There’s something about the phrase “success theater” that immediately hits
home. You just _know _what it means.

It’s hearing you hit the quarterly goal, but knowing [the corners you had to
cut](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/cutting-corners-and-electric-fences-
c8fbfaa4d91a) (and the people who will have to clean up the mess), listening
to someone rattle off vanity metrics that say nothing, but claim everything,
or being told you’re not a team player for having some doubts about a recent
“win”. It’s all optics and smoke and mirrors, and the experience sucks. To
anyone who takes their craft seriously, there’s no escaping that crappy
feeling.

It’s also seductive. Building stuff that people use and pay for (for real)
isn’t easy. It’s fraught with all kinds of setbacks and the reality is often
unfriendly. We want desperately for things to work, and need a small dose of
delusion just to keep going. But …

### Success theater undermines the long-term potential of your team (and
organization). It:

  * Dampens introspection
  * Fosters an environment unfriendly to healthy push-back
  * Gnaws at your most passionate team members (feels intellectually dishonest)
  * Insults the intelligence of your team
  * Sets you up for a rude awakening
  * Reduces safety and trust on teams (“I have to put on a smile, or else….”)
  * Locks you into keeping the illusion alive at all costs (the show must go on)
  * Puts optics ahead of your customers
  * Syphons your team’s valuable creative energy
  * Establishes a difficult to navigate dual reality
  * Deals in [vanity metrics not actionable metrics](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2009/05/19/vanity-metrics-vs-actionable-metrics/)
  * Makes it hard to filter out the “real” good news
  * Reduces the ability to detect weak signals
  * Discourages measuring what is really happening
  * Limits risk-taking and innovation
  * Leans on one group (or multiple groups) to deal with the reality

### That’s bad! But what can we do about it?

  * Lead by example. Once reinforced by leadership, success theater is very difficult to combat
  * Share some challenging news. Talk about missteps
  * When you have real wins, celebrate them like crazy. Have fun when the wins are real
  * Talk about failure and learning regularly (and respectfully)
  * Ask your team what success looks like to _them. _Get them involved
  * Ask your team to come up with actionable (and meaningful) metrics
  * Invite them to pick about the current metrics / units of success
  * Acknowledge (never dismiss) team feedback, and explain your rationale for doing or not doing something about it
  * Teach all team members about your company’s business model and operating assumptions. Regularly revisit those assumptions
  * Explain why targets/goals are what they are, and why it matters
  * Make it safe for someone to say things like “I’m not seeing why that’s a win ….” or “I really feel like we’re cutting the wrong corners”
  * Compensate/reward on performances and outcomes that matter, and that don’t cause divisions in your team. Rewarding success theater sets a terrible example
  * If optics matter to the external world — they usually do — have frank discussions on why that is the case, and how external messaging cannot dictate the internal dialogue


# Beat the Feature Factory — With Biz Chops

Buy the CFO lunch …

### Beat the Feature Factory — With Biz Chops

#### Buy the CFO lunch …

I’ll probably ending up writing a couple of posts focused on beating the
feature factory (see my post [12 Signs You’re Working in a Feature
Factory](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-
44a5b938d6a2#.5wrtg2rog)).

Yes, software product development teams (UX, Engineering, Product) need to
[get out of the building](http://www.inc.com/steve-blank/key-to-success-
getting-out-of-building.html). Equally important, is for everyone to **walk up
to the second floor** (or wherever “the business” hangs out).

**Arrange a meeting with your company’s CFO and/or CEO (I recommend the CFO because they tend to be less biased)**. Have them explain the moving parts in the business model, and the assumptions that underpin forecasts and growth targets. How do you _really_ make money, and what must remain true for you to continue to make money? What costs matter now? Why are sales goals what they are? Where does product _performance_ fit into the big picture?

To defeat the feature factory, the front-line must learn to speak the language
of the business _as well as_ the language of their craft. It’s the game you’re
playing. Resist all efforts to “protect and insulate” you from this
information. Be wary when told that the team “just needs to execute”. For a
great fictional example of how/why this works, read [The Phoenix Project by
Gene Kim, George Spafford, and Kevin
Behr](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AZRBLHO/ref=dp-kindle-
redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) .

I’m always amused when middle-manager business types are somehow surprised
(and even threatened) by the critical thinking skills of UX and software
developers. You can’t really blame them. Their worldview hinges on owning
this. But pushing back with vague discomfort and pleas for craft will fall on
deaf ears. You’ll need to talk the language of the business. For example …

  * “If we continue to iterate on this existing feature we can achieve that goal without having to fork the product. It’s worth our focus.”
  * “The work we’re doing is barely making a dent in that metrics.”
  * “If we accumulate this technical debt, we wont be able to meet those goals for new product development. I’ve observed the following leading indicators …”
  * “Churn will increase beyond your threshold if we don’t double-down on nipping this expectation mismatch in the bud.”
  * “We can still meet these sales goals if we choose to be more selective. Building feature on demand is a distraction, and I’ll show you why ….”

So set up an innocent meeting with your CFO. She’ll probably love the fact
that you’re going to be her second pair of eyes on the front-lines. Learn
everything you can, and then start looking for ways to drive outcomes and
commerce with craft. The two do intersect … you just need to understand the
landscape.

### Dear Product Managers …

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*s-ZwCwJVMPWQoodMRI42_A.jpeg)

We know your job is hard, but you need to let us help you. We’ve got the chops
and creativity, and want to help you, the team, the product, and our company
win.

There are a couple things on our mind that we would like to discuss. We’d do
this in person, but the last thing we need is another meeting.

We are curious. Is any of our hard work _really_ paying off for our customers
and business? Is it moving the needle? It might not seem like it, but we care.
When we know we’re delivering results, it is a little easier to stomach
releasing mediocre work, just shipping it, accumulating debt, and jumping to
the next project. Without some evidence that we’re making decent decisions,
those things add up. Frankly, we stop trusting you and stop caring.

Guessing is fine (we all do it). Guessing without reflecting is not fine.
We’ll never learn that way. Some of us are wondering whether continuing to
iterate and doing _better_ work might deliver even _better_ results?! Perhaps?

We need your help. The team is measured (officially or otherwise) every day:
uptime, defect counts, story point velocity, test coverage, hours spent
programming, acceptance criteria met, and stories and features shipped. But
none of these things indicate customer outcomes. It’s the opposite, actually.
Feature-bloat adds complexity, and complexity slows us down.Keeping us busy is
not the goal. Delivering outcomes is the goal.

We know you are under a lot of pressure to execute. You might have done UX or
development in the past, but you don’t now. You need us. Therefore, we’d
appreciate it if you treat us like partners, and not the construction and
assembly crew. Introduce us to actual customers. Let us contribute ideas. Let
us monitor and measure progress, and change course accordingly. Give us
context, and we will do good work.

Of course you don’t _need_ to do this — we can dutifully give you estimates,
and build your ideas to spec, and deliver things into the abyss — and this can
keep us interested for a couple months or years, but eventually we’ll move to
work somewhere else (the market is great these days). The company won’t notice
for a bit (hurray velocity!) but our customers will suffer, and the business
will suffer. We don’t want that, do we?

We respect your chops, instincts, perspective, and surreal ability to sit
through monotonous meetings. Let’s help each other do our best work, deliver
value to our customers, and build something we are all proud of.

Thanks

Engineers &amp; UX

# Place Your Bets

### Place Your Bets

#### Describing product (and company) strategy as a series of bets

In recent posts [12 Signs You’re Working in a Feature
Factory](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-
44a5b938d6a2#.2jkk8hw2m), [Success Theater](https://medium.com/p/success-
theater-b60a1666fe67), and [Dear Product Managers](https://hackernoon.com
/dear-product-managers-c488ba6386ea), I discuss the resentment engineers and
UX feel when product managers fail to reflect on actual outcomes. Part of the
issue here is the challenge of building shared context and a shared
vocabulary. Words are powerful, and they matter.

I’m always on the lookout for more effective ways to talk about strategy
(especially in a way that resonates with the front-line). In this post, I’m
going to talk about the power of the word **_bet_**.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*p1UPrbUm4vGGayVmMBTylQ.png)

Old-school roulette (Wikipedia)

A couple months ago, I read an [interesting post by Henrik
Kniberg](http://blog.crisp.se/2016/06/08/henrikkniberg/spotify-rhythm) where
he shared [his
slides](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1018963/Projects/2016-05%20agila%20sverige%20spotify%20rhythm/Spotify%20Rhythm%20-%20Agila%20Sverige.pdf)
from a presentation at Agila Sverige. The slides describe Spotify’s current
strategic planning approach (aka Spotify Rhythm) and are worth reviewing.
Among all of the great nuggets, one thing in particular jumped out at me: the
use of the word _bet_. Over the years I’ve encountered Projects, Missions,
Initiatives, Epics, Objectives, Rocks, Boulders, OKRs, Experiments, and Goals
(and a bunch more I’m probably forgetting). But never Bets.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*z2NgaFBKcJXJ_bXDCbL0qQ.png)

Slide from Henrik’s presentation

So I tried Bets with teams (along with the DIBB framework he discusses, and
combined with missions and initiatives) and have become a fan. Bets are
versatile and fun to talk about. They capture that perfect interplay between
assumptions, desired outcomes, experimentation, risk, and reward.

Why does the word _bet _work?

  1. A bet can be tactical or strategic, prescriptive or descriptive. It can relate to what you’ll build, the problem you hope to solve, or what will happen in the marketplace (for example). It can range in scope from the core assumptions about the business to the outcomes of a small continuous improvement experiment
  2. Bets can be loose or strict. Business cases are typically “heavy”. Bets can be lightweight, or super structured
  3. Bets are by definition outcome focused. We bet that something will _happen_, and ask “how is the that bet working out?”. But they also suggest experimentation and learning
  4. By calling it a bet, we are admitting that “losing” the bet is an option. Somehow, even the word _experiment_ fails to prepare us for failure
  5. Bets have odds. Sometimes the odds are known, and sometimes they aren’t known
  6. There are big and small bets. This can be discussed in terms of very concrete costs, or in looser concepts like opportunity cost, distraction, fatigue of the team, intensity of work required, etc.
  7. Timeframe matters. When will we know if the bet paid off?
  8. Talking about bets will inevitably trigger good discussions around risk, information availability, learning, validation, and outcomes. They make good conversation pieces. They’re fun to talk about
  9. We explore the various implicit bets we are making (but not formally acknowledging). For example, by betting on enterprise customers (bet A) we may be implicitly betting on a longer sales cycle (bet B) and the ability to support enterprise customers with the existing support team (bet C)
  10. Bets force us to explore our “operating” assumptions and “universal truths” (what Knikberg called Beliefs and North Star / 2 Year Goals). My bet might be your validated truth. Or, I might have noticed signs from the market that a fundamental tenant of the business is now on shaky ground. If something is a sure thing (and almost nothing is), then it is no longer a bet
  11. By placing small bets (with a short timeframe) we can “buy” information that clarifies the odds for larger bets
  12. You can have a “portfolio” of bets, each with different risk profiles, hedges, etc. Discussing this with the team helps us frame our appetite for risk across the program/portfolio
  13. We consider the ideal number of concurrent bets (“bets in progress”). Taking too many bets at once can distract the team and in some cases teams will pursue clashing/competitive bets that reduce the odds overall
  14. Bets can be “nested” hierarchically and/or have dependencies. The company could have a big bet on an emerging technology which cascades into a number of smaller, more tactical feature bets

Check out Kniberg’s slides. Their framework may or may not be right for your
company, but the word Bet might still prove to be useful.

### Safety, Discomfort, and the Art of Self-Service Un***king

To quote [Joshua Kerievsky](https://medium.com/u/28229c304ac9) ‘s brilliant
[Modern Agile principles](http://modernagile.org/), you must “make safety a
prerequisite”. Without safety and trust, we rightfully resist change. When
safety is present, we relish the thrill of going outside of our comfort zone,
learning new things, exploring our limits, challenging our biases, and taking
risks. [People don´t resist change (only being
changed)](https://twitter.com/NielsPflaeging/status/793414761232928768).
According to Google research, [psychological safety is the key
predictor](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-
from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=0) of team success.

<http://diving.about.com/od/forbeginners/a/getStarted.htm>

I’m always amazed when an executive bemoans the fact that her team won’t try
new things, only to hear about a culture of blame, retribution, and distrust.
Compare …

> Oh geez. Things are a mess right now, but in that exciting kind of way. I
don’t mind when my boss gives me a hard time and pushes me. It makes me better
at what I do, and I trust them. When I describe real blockers, he understands.
And he’s always straightforward. No duplicity

vs.

> When I’m not around, she talks shit about me. Always second-guessing my
work, and never letting me take risks. Also, it is almost like she is playing
a game with me: not letting me know if I’m doing a good job, and keeping me
guessing. It’s terrible. All I can focus on now is the immediate task at hand,
and doing what is asked of me.

Improvement requires safety, a modest amount of discomfort, time for recovery,
and time for reflection and learning. Discomfort can be a terrible experience,
or it can be exciting. It can destroy us, or serve as a signpost and catalyst
for better outcomes. [We feel
flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29) when we are
moderately challenged. In their quest for “harmony”, too many organizations
accidentally eradicate positive levels of challenge and discomfort.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*_q7oLu6E0TlOiU8Wk3GC7Q.png)

A bit of brainstorming on high/low safety and high/low discomfort

Best practices are overrated. As a consultant, I very rarely say something to
my customer that hasn’t been said before by some members of their team. Those
team members might have given up on sounding the alarm, but they know what’s
up. Somewhere, in your org, are the ingredients for the solution. Not **THE
SOLUTION**, but the ingredients — the people, the context, the experience, and
the perspective — for progress to emerge. If process or knowing best practices
was your problem, you would have solved it already. I’m happy to think about
catalysts and attractors, but not “ways”.

Most of the rigor around change management and “transformation” is founded on
a fundamental (conscious or unconscious) underestimation of your people, their
resilience, and their desire to improve. The helicopter management that ensues
is part of the problem. That, and the delusion that you know the change end-
point.

Below I list 45 _potential _areas for experimentation. This list is _not
_prescriptive. It is directional. These are heuristics. They work because we
_tend_ to benefit from _some movement _in these areas_._

Take batch sizes. Yes, there is an economically ideal batch size for each
initiative. But we _tend _to work in batches that are too large, and ship too
infrequently. You could pull these out of a hat and experiment randomly if you
wanted. My bet is that a safe team trying things at random would vastly
outperform a prescriptive change management approach.

Random Experiments^Safety &gt; Best Practices^No Safety

Make it safe to go outside your comfort zone. Your goal is to try safe-to-
fail-experiments to move these needles and see what happens. The end-goal IS
NOT to move the needle, but rather to see what happens when and if you move
the needle!

Try (to):

  1. Ship sooner
  2. Ship more often
  3. Build less
  4. Release smaller batches
  5. Tweak and iterate more
  6. Remove more features
  7. Get feedback sooner
  8. More direct contact with the customer/user
  9. More direct contact with internal resources
  10. Gather more evidence of impact
  11. Be more obsessed about customer value
  12. Try more options
  13. Explore more novel solutions
  14. Be less prescriptive
  15. Commit later
  16. Converge and align later
  17. Less need for certainty
  18. Experiment more
  19. Broader mission and initiative scope
  20. Less prescriptive
  21. More slack
  22. More stepping away from the keyboard
  23. Less multitasking and context switching
  24. Fewer hand-offs
  25. Less rigid roles &amp; responsibilities
  26. More mobbing and swarming
  27. Fewer “transactional” meetings
  28. Less bureaucracy
  29. Less planning-in-progress
  30. Less planning-in-inventory
  31. Fewer dependencies and constraints
  32. Fewer phase-gates and approval steps
  33. Less focus on efficiency
  34. More transparency
  35. More off-sites and team bonding
  36. Invite more voices to the conversation
  37. More responsibility
  38. More team autonomy and ownership

  40. More trust
  41. Less success theater

### Startups and the Enterprise Vortex

I have a friend who recently wrote me with some questions about whether their
startup should “start selling to enterprises”. Sharing my response below.

* * *

I’ve found that startups get sucked into the enterprise vortex prematurely,
and not as a result of a premeditated strategy (although we pretend there is).
It “just happens”. Like most things, it feels right initially, and the costs
are less visible.

  1. Enterprise deals are enticing, but **they are a breeding ground for the sunk cost fallacy.** It’s hard to walk away from a deal you’ve spent ten months cultivating. What’s “right” for the company (and product) is routinely sacrificed for the “big deal” and short-term growth. This is rationalized, of course, but with flimsy, bias-driven arguments about reusability, strategy, and optics. Why exactly couldn’t you close five deals totaling the same amount with far less hassle?
  2. I’m all for a mid to later stage startup expanding into the enterprise, but only with _intention. _**Startups slip into an enterprise strategy, instead of really thinking it through**. In most startups that “go big”, the shift in direction is highly reactive. Deal size is too small. Smaller companies with limited budget don’t see immediate value in your product. There’s something structurally off in your approach. Instead of addressing those problems, you opt instead for the beauty of the big relationship sell. That becomes your salvation.
  3. **It is a self-fulfilling prophecy**. When you go big, you close big deals (if your product has a modicum of promise). You close big deals with entities that have lots of money to play around with and experiment. You are literally an experimental buy. Suddenly, your team reports “seeing traction with bigger customers, and the average deal size increasing”. Each quarter you bank on closing one or two of these to make the quarter. That manifests in rationalizing an enterprise approach. The question remains … did you really, really give the original approach a fair chance? A common excuse I hear is something like “well, our product is SO unique that it requires a high-touch approach”. Sometimes that is true. Oftentimes it says more about your implementation of the product. Simplifying the above. There are a million reasons why you’ll rationalize the shift into the enterprise. Attack each one. Have you given the less capital intensive, more organic, more product-centric approach a real shot?
  4. **“Land and expand” is another one of those things that looks great on paper, but it rife with bias**. All too often it is codeword for “let’s basically give away the product to a small department, deal with all the bureaucratic hassles, handle all sorts of custom requests and kid-glove them, and cross our fingers.”
  5. **(Many) enterprises are laggards.** This is a huge generalization, but the people who work in large orgs are typically less savvy, have less experience with modern tools, and are more easily impressed. They’re craving ANYTHING that works. Their IT departments are swamped. This is great on one level — they need help — but it also means you aren’t getting as many critical eyes on the product. Back to the generalization … some large companies behave like small companies. Are you targeting them also? Do you have traction there?
  6. **Attacking the enterprise is distracting and lengthens feedback loops**. The deals are higher touch. You need more people around to tie up the loose ends. There’s more cognitive dissonance. Suddenly, your CTO is spending half of their time completing massive security reviews. Most importantly, it becomes harder to see through the fog. It is more difficult to innovate, react, and pivot when 80% of your revenue is coming from six big players.
  7. **It is harder to go backwards**. The nature of org systems dictates that it is always easier to go up-market, than it is to structure your org around “going backwards” and offering a more mass market option. Targeting the enterprise impacts your organization in a way that is difficult to unwind, and even more difficult to run concurrently with a more self-service approach.

I mention this above, but the hardest thing to tackle here is that “going big”
is a self-reinforcing loop. It will challenge every fiber in your body once
you start tiptoeing in that direction. Start, and you will almost certainly
rationalize: enterprise reps, new biz dev hires, custom services, custom
training, customer-specific features, poor UX, and the customer/user dichotomy
(well, the people paying don’t use it so _______ ).

I realize how hard it is to be running on empty. It is terrible and scary. I
also realize how hard it is to resist the lure of big deals, and to resist the
cognitive biases that start to kick in. The best I can offer is to strategize
with intent, and to act based on experiments with sound experiment design.
Fight the urge as long as possible. I’m not saying it is “bad” or “good”, but
that startups _tend _to go that direction prematurely. There’s plenty of time
to tackle the enterprise.

### A 12-Step Program for Recovering Product Managers

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1800/1*txyuPaVi0r2IALW3zjwUqA.jpeg)

I frequently hear from Product Managers that want to break the vicious cycle
of the [Feature Factory](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a
-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2#.cyaqivj9x). You know it’s wrong for your team,
and your customers, but you can’t break free. Sometimes you question whether
product management is even the right profession.

Trust me. I’ve been there. There’s hope, and it all starts with you! It is
time to reaffirm your commitment to your craft.

Update (12/16/2016): I recorded a 45 minute video talking about the 12 points
and added shortcuts to each point below. My advice … read first, before
jumping into the video.

  1. **I WILL** accept my own [fallibility](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/40-lies-pms-tell-themselves-20be00570dc#.7ofz5sevq), and the power that cognitive biases have over my decision making ([2:35](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=155))
  2. **I WILL **work to earn the trust of the team, and commit to creating a safe environment that is friendly to taking risks, practicing our craft, and being transparent and honest ([5:20](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=320))
  3. **I WILL** refuse to make promises and commitments that impact the team, without first consulting with the team ([8:36](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=516))
  4. **I WILL** respect the fact that makers [need uninterrupted time](http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) to ponder, experiment, and build. I will make myself available at all times, but without interrupting and breaking the team’s flow ([10:10](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=610))
  5. **I WILL** focus on making ALL of the people in our ecosystem — [customers/users](https://vimeo.com/131407754), immediate team members, extended team members, “the business”, investors, and partners — awesome. Not through coercion, or manipulation, but by always experimenting with things that might allow people to do their best work ([11:55](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=715))
  6. **I WIL**L detach from my pet solutions (and the solutions offered by HIPPOs and customers), and focus instead on gathering data about problems worth solving. The team (with me as a member) will decide which problems and solutions are worth pursuing ([17:00](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=1020))
  7. **I WILL** shorten the distance between the customer/user and the team, and [resist the temptation to act as a go-between](https://medium.com/@JoshuaKerievsky/customer-obsessed-teams-dont-have-product-owners-7c20a01c195f#.yxdq0s9s1). Whenever possible, we will seek to let the customer represent themselves, and will refer to actual usage data in addition to what people say ([19:32](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=1172))
  8. **I WILL** work with the team to deliver continuous value (not features, or story points). When faced with big batches, we will work to decompose those batches, and deliver value (and learn) incrementally. With flow, many rituals (e.g. estimation) will fall by the wayside, and I will support the team’s decision to stop rituals that add no value. In terms of process, I will advocate for as little process as necessary to preserve safety, and challenge my own need for certainty and control ([23:10](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=1390))
  9. **I WILL** collaborate with the team to measure, iterate, and celebrate based on the actual impact of our work. We will fail often, but will leave sufficient time to learn from those failed experiments and deliver the best outcome possible ([28:16](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=1696))
  10. **I WILL** stop trying to “keep the team busy” at all costs, and will encourage the team to leave sufficient slack for personal projects, professional development, and having a life outside of work. Whenever possible, we will [keep utilization rates at a reasonable leve](https://hbr.org/2012/05/six-myths-of-product-development)l, and strive to deliver outcomes while at the same time “[maximizing the amount of work not done](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)” ([29:50](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=1790))
  11. **I WILL** respect the strong desire to [not cut corners](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/cutting-corners-and-electric-fences-c8fbfaa4d91a), and do whatever possible to promote the sound economics of “doing the job right” and/or committing as a team to address those cut corners at some point in the foreseeable future ([33:30](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=2010))
  12. **I WILL** reflect on the points above, seek feedback and coaching, accept and address my weaknesses, and continue to do what works (until it stops working). And I’ll take care of myself, meditate, and not become a stressed out / terrible person to be around ([36:25](https://youtu.be/1sej105qY1E?t=2185))

I’ve recently become a fan of [Joshua
Kerievsky](https://medium.com/u/28229c304ac9)’s four [Modern Agile
principles](https://www.infoq.com/articles/modern-agile-intro) which dovetail
nicely with these 12 points. They are worth checking out if you are sick of
the “Agile industrial complex”.

# 110 Product Development Posts Later…

### 110 Product Development Posts Later…

#### Time flies when you’re figuring stuff out (and getting more confused)

Just realized … wow, 110 posts!

Writing on Medium is my way of thinking stuff through. It’s a messy process,
with lots of revisiting ideas, and a big dose of angst. Things got crazy in
the last 30 days with 200,000+ views (thanks Reddit, that’s it, I can retire),
but my expectations with any particular post are low. I expect it to flop, and
get pleasantly surprised when folks find it.

I love all things product development related. There’s something so powerful
about small groups of smart craftspeople building stuff, validating it,
tweaking/refining it, and delivering real value — not success theater — to
customers and the business. Naive? Maybe. But hey, we pick our path.

Medium oddly makes it hard to get a nice, clean list of your posts. So to
celebrate 110, here goes …

### 140 Product Management Action Verbs

I enjoy brainstorming words. It’s a weird habit. When describing our work, we
often talk in platitudes. Words jog our memory, and force us to think about
what we need and don’t need. What do you need? Do you need things that
inherently clash? Who can realistically do what?

Here is a [Google Sheet with the list of
words](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WHptwdv8uH_AJAgyptCCZFYSiLlj6eBV_qgkrUtZnA8/edit?usp=sharing).
Might be interesting to look at your PM job descriptions, and see how these
line up. Or revisit your resume.


# Evangelist/Consultant Myopia

How can change agents and change participants make each other awesome (see the
Modern Agile first principle: Make People Awesome)?

### Evangelist/Consultant Myopia

How can change agents and change participants make each other awesome ([see
the Modern Agile first principle: Make People
Awesome](https://www.infoq.com/articles/modern-agile-intro))?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*SZw2Z7tnK2Q5qKxlbOS6Mg.png)

Come Into The Woods: Melonie King

Today’s Thought: **Change agent myopia does not make people awesome**. It’s
easy to ignore how silly a lot of what we’re spewing actually sounds, unless
you’ve seen it work:

  * Why _wouldn’t_ we try to build more?
  * Why _would_ we let our engineers sit around and mob program all day?
  * Why _wouldn’t_ we try to speed up?
  * Why _wouldn’t_ we just design everything upfront?
  * Why _wouldn’t_ we try to keep our developers busy?
  * Why _wouldn’t_ we try to establish clear roles and responsibilities, clear lines of accountability, and efficient processes?
  * Why _wouldn’t_ we run a feature factory?

Context and work history dictates our perspective. I spoke recently with
someone who had focused on “the enterprise” for their career. They simply
couldn’t believe that other organizations targeted similar customers (size,
savviness, product complexity) but worked in entirely different ways. “You’re
***ing kidding me! No one brings a bunch of engineers on site to visit
customers!”

There are two ways to respond here:

  1. a dash of smugness, point to some books, insinuate their org is behind the curve, hype a buzzword methodology, reference a keynote talk on YouTube, or
  2. curiosity, empathy, and accepting the burden of proof.

The former fails to accept that what you’re pitching is likely highly
counterintuitive. It might have no connection to what this person has seen,
experienced, has been subjected to, and has tried in their career. The latter
invites an experimentation mindset.

I’ve attended — and sadly given — many talks where the upshot is “you’re
wrong, you are behind the curve, and there is a better way!” Peppered through
the talk are a list of symptoms everyone can relate to. The audience nods.
People laugh. People cry. They want to up their game!

But the reality is that only 5% of the people in the room have actually
_experienced _(and that is the critical word) or even observed the better way
of working. 15% have experienced some sort of watered down pragmatic variation
(see [Larman’s Laws of Organizational
Behavior](http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/index.php?title=Larman%27s_Laws_of_Organizational_Behavior)).
95% of the audience relates to the pain, but cannot relate to the path forward
on any visceral, non-theoretical level. And therein is the challenge. We are
complex animals, and we like quacking ducks and good stories.

Lasting change often follows a cataclysmic event. In a fit of existential
struggle, the organization flips the lever and launches into the new. You
could argue that change agents would, in many cases, be better served by
triggering an oh-shit threat, and just sitting back.

The other approach is to focus on running safe-to-fail experiments that let
people experience the new, and judge for themselves. Have empathy. Start with
where you are. Respect prior experience. And focus on experiencing the new in
with safety and trust.

### Untangling OKRs with a Big, Visual Board

_Note: A 1.3MB version of this imagine can be found
_[_here_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B04yoW1JFDHGak0tR0xGYllFM0E/view?usp=sharing)_.
I use the term OKR below. To learn more about OKRs see
_[_here_](http://eleganthack.com/the-art-of-the-okr/)_. I use a diagram (not a
photo) here for confidentiality reasons._

Do you use OKRs? Can you visualize the work of a 100–300 person company on a
single “board” ? I think so. With this format, I’m trying to address four key
problems:

  1. Visualizing how team-level goals and company goals interact
  2. Big batch planning
  3. Confusion over cross-team and team based goals
  4. Confusion over “we’d do that anyway” goals and powerful, mission-based goals

The most important characteristic of the board’s format is that it is
continuous. The leftmost column is always Month 0. As we move into the future,
there’s less room for detail. Month 0, the current month, is significantly
bigger than month 6. Vertical height constrains the number of cross-functional
objectives (Boulders) we can pursue at once. In this example it is a single
item. **The board is always kept up to date, and represents our current
reality. It is big, but that is what walls are for.**

I break down the elements below, but here is the board in its loveliness:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1800/1*pFgqAU8yrpJ2xC3tXiLHsQ.png)

The Board. _A 1.3MB version of this imagine can be found
_[_here_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B04yoW1JFDHGak0tR0xGYllFM0E/view?usp=sharing)_._

There are five swim-lanes on the board. Why five?

I’m a big fan of a singular focus. But in talking to teams, I noticed that
**financial goals** rarely have salience. These goals are seen as a leading
indicator of doing great things, but are not the _great things_ themselves. So
when picking OKRs, you always have this struggle over whether to include them.
It’s the same deal with health metrics. While important — you don’t want to
drive your company into the ground — they are something we monitor constantly.
So I lump those into a single swim-lane.

  * **Financial Goals &amp; Health Metrics**. Key monthly and quarterly financial goals such as revenue targets, sales targets, MRR, churn rates, average deal size, monthly burn, etc.

### What We Can’t See

Close a deal and money gets transferred into your bank account. That feels
real. Hire three new people and increase your burn by $50k per month… ouch!
That feels real too. If only our wins, risks, and losses were always so
salient.

The central problem is that the many of the costs we incur do not feel real.
The impact is barely felt, or misdiagnosed entirely. It’s not visible and
salient, like beating the quarter or closing a round. Suddenly you turn around
and it smacks you in the face, and there’s not much you can do to turn back
the tide. Or you see the dark clouds coming from miles away, but the various
remedies seem to further exacerbate the problem.

What can you do? Are we destined to get caught in these traps? Is the only
answer to spend our way out of it when the shit hits the fan?

I don’t think so. I think it takes awareness, and engaging the front-lines in
relaying their feedback. You have an org filled with “sensors”, and they are
capable of sensing the [drift into
failure](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10258783-drift-into-failure).
Plus, you can always do a better job of making certain costs more visible.
Just being open that these things exist can have a big impact. But you’ll have
to free your own mind, and start listening.

What types of costs and impacts are we looking for? We are looking for
movement/changes/vacillations in the following:

  * Cost of technical, UX, and instrumentation debt
  * Cost of leadership/organizational debt
  * Cost to communicate context/data with minimal signal loss across organization
  * Impacts on team morale and engagement
  * Impacts on resiliency, ability to adapt/adjust to changing context
  * Impacts on ability to pursue novel solutions / fortuitous accidents
  * Impacts on overall “efficiency” (velocity/headcount, etc.)
  * Cost of multitasking and context-switching
  * Cost to service diverse market segments, user personas
  * Cost to maintain increasing technical complexity
  * Cost to compete with smaller, yet more nimble competitors
  * Cost to document and support new functionality
  * Impacts on new skill attainment (professional development)
  * Cost of knowledge/skill silos
  * Cost to hire and onboard new team members
  * Cost of unrecognized, untapped human potential
  * Impacts on goodwill with customer/user communities
  * Cost to maintain integrations and partner relationships

### 50 Things I’ve Learned About Product Management

#### The Sunday, can’t sleep, had coffee after 2PM edition…

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*qDSjH1hEIeCtnQm8jZchmw.jpeg)

It’s often the little things that count…

  1. You are wrong more often than you are right. The trick is getting a couple shots at solving the problem.
  2. Your company can do (almost) everything wrong, and still grow in the short and near term.
  3. You can do (almost) everything right, and not outrun the elephant in the room.
  4. Without a strong product vision, you’ll end up outsourcing product strategy to the rest of the company.
  5. Don’t hire product managers to be (mediocre) project managers. There are awesome project managers out there if that is what you need.
  6. The best way to get people off your back is to deliver value continuously (with data to back it up). Real results (and a proud team) eat everything for breakfast.
  7. Craft and commerce are not incompatible. Reckless growth and craft are incompatible.
  8. Passing the trash to other departments (e.g. “support will deal with it”) always comes back to bite you.
  9. Someone on your team has a better idea. Would you know?
  10. Shiny objects sometimes work. But shiny things always fade.
  11. To learn how to be a good PM, spend time working on a team with a great PM.
  12. Show — with data, stories, and examples — don’t tell.
  13. Driving out all uncertainty tends to drive out originality (and innovation).
  14. You tend to go where you look. If you look too hard at the competition you’ll go towards them, instead of towards point ahead of them.
  15. If you’re arguing about the impact of UX on the bottom line, you should probably consider working for a more forward thinking company.
  16. Everyone ends up hating the ticketing system. And the wiki. That’s partly because we overload our ticketing systems with extra process/metrics/junk, and no one actually contributes to the wiki.
  17. With user stories it’s the conversation that counts. Have the conversation!
  18. At some point you’ll have the benefit of the doubt. Make that count.
  19. When heroics become the norm, then only heroics will generate reasonable results.
  20. Before you send that canary-in-the-coalmine email, keep a journal for a week and reflect.
  21. If it’s not a good fit, leave before there are hard feelings.
  22. Is the product manager actually managing a _product_? If not, do you need a product manager?
  23. If the team isn’t inviting you to the retros, you’ve got to figure out why and fix that.
  24. All bets are off until someone is trying to use the feature with their data, in their environment, in their day to day work. You have to leave time to iterate based on that feedback.
  25. Sales will tell you that they need a way to track feature requests. They don’t. They need a product that will close deals, white papers, customer referrals, and a defined available market.
  26. Trying to land a 747 on a speedboat is never a good idea. Work in small batches, and plan at the last responsible moment.
  27. People say product managers need to learn to say “no”. Try “no, because ….” and endeavor to make some sense.
  28. Teams will always sniff out success theater. They might not call you out publicly, but they’ll become disengaged.
  29. When you are busy and multitasking it is easy to come off as standoffish.
  30. Don’t assume that people who complain in private, will also go to the mat in public.
  31. Before you go on about 10x engineers, ask yourself if you are a 10x product manager, and if you’re focusing on the 10% of things that will actually drive outcomes.
  32. Spend time in the support queue, jump on customer success calls, and try to close some deals.
  33. In most cases, your biggest competition is the status quo. Same goes internally.
  34. The users that have given up on you aren’t replying to your NPS survey.
  35. You are the CEO of the product if you can hire/fire, are responsible to investors, and control the budgeting process. If not, you are probably a product manager.
  36. Discuss what you’re ignoring, or making worse, in your quest to make something else better. Build shared understanding about the tradeoffs.
  37. Know when to get out of the way. If you’re good, you’ll always have work to do. Don’t insert yourself into every conversation and decision.
  38. Beware of complex prioritization schemes that serve (mostly) to make everyone internally more comfortable. Back-of-napkin heuristics are good enough in most cases.
  39. Nothing gets people more bitter than a PM who tries to self-promote. Celebrate (and fail and learn) with your team.
  40. Savor the moments when your team is kicking ass. It happens infrequently. Not because anyone is doing anything wrong, but because this is hard!
  41. If you find yourself asking for small estimates frequently — things that might take a day, or two, or three — make sure you’re actually working towards the most important outcome. If that’s the deciding factory, the value of story must be pretty darn weak.
  42. It’s not how many bullet points you add to the feature release notes (or story points completed or the team’s velocity). It’s the customer success stories you can tell, and the outcomes you can create for the business, both in the short and long term.
  43. You can fall in love with most product “problems”. Don’t rule out unsexy domains. Your happiness will be largely dictated by your immediate team, and the willingness of the organization to let you and the team solve problems. That can happen anywhere.
  44. When people keep bugging you about the roadmap, it’s typically a sign they aren’t happy with what’s happening right now.
  45. Block out time each day to think strategically. Block out time each day to interact with customers.
  46. If your team is moving slowly, make it safe for them to openly discuss the debt they’re digging out of and/or dealing with.
  47. Be available! This is a no brainer, but plenty of PMs keep their calendar stacked.
  48. Don’t force convergence prematurely. Often the best path forward comes after a period of confusion and messiness.
  49. If in doubt, get out of your head and gather data. Build something and test. Same goes with meetings where there is endless conjecture. Have a bias for action!
  50. Avoid calling a hard stop on an effort and surprising the team. It will seem arbitrary, and (hopefully) they are vested in the outcome.


# PM “Responsibilities” ?

There are a bunch of ways to unpack this question.

* * *

### PM “Responsibilities” ?

There are a bunch of ways to unpack this question.

In this post I look at the front-line team’s perspective, and share real world
results from a team exercise. In short, I don’t have the answer. You and your
team has the “answer”, and your context will change next week and you’ll need
to recalibrate. I explained this point of view recently in the Product HQ
Slack group when asked about the differentiation between PO/PM duties, but I
think it applies equally here:

> Get in a room. Make it safe for people to speak their mind. Make the
invisible work visible. Do a value stream mapping exercises. Make temporary
working agreements visible, but always subject to negotiation. And then find a
way to regularly inspect and adapt. In any rapidly changing context, roles and
responsibilities will be in constant flux. How you work will be in flux. If
they aren’t, you are probably over-optimizing on efficiency (unless you are in
a very, very stable domain).

> We often address the symptom … “if only we had clearer roles and
responsibilities”. And then a consultant comes in a writes a bunch of bullet
points. And the problems persist. Why? R/R weren’t the problem. Having the
trust/safety to adapt and converse was the problem. Strict “contract
negotiations” on bullet points broke in a matter of days.

Here’s the messiness from the real world.

In this exercise, the team brainstormed areas of responsibility for the
product manager. As a team member, the product manager participated. Together
they removed perfect duplicates, but opted to keep items that overlapped but
had some unique characteristics (e.g. coaching and facilitation). I was blown
away by how many items they brainstormed in the ten minutes provided.

Independently, the engineers and product manager looked at each item and
indicated who was _responsible_ for the task/skill on a sliding scale. A score
“in the middle” meant that the responsibility was shared 50/50, whereas a
score on the left or right extreme meant that the PM/Engineers assumed full
responsibility for that item. Importantly the group was asked to take a broad
view of responsibility … “these are hats that we can all wear, and are not
written in stone”.

What do you notice? Where does this team need more shared understanding? Where
is there agreement and disagreement? How might you go about addressing those
deltas? Is some disagreement _healthy_?

### 90 Problems You’ve Heard About Before

#### Take heart. You are not alone.

In software product development, problems are a constant. Teams everywhere are
venting, ruminating, introspecting, experimenting, and searching. It isn’t
easy, and that is what makes it fun.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*wa6E9Y_SJ_iM5eOyC16AsQ.jpeg)

Every fix has side effects, and superheroes all have a weakness. The obvious
invites the unexpected. Change is nonlinear, and rapid phase shifts can occur
unexpectedly. Human systems are messy. We’re biased, stubborn, and fall in
love with our ideas. A watched pot never boils and everything eats everything
for breakfast.

The problems will never stop coming. The trick then is how to deal with (and
to be strengthened by) the constant perturbations, threats, upheavals, and
change. How do you foster a self-repairing, self-strengthening system?

Because I’m sure (some of) these will sound familiar…

* * *

> Lots of the features we ship never get used

> I have no idea if anyone is using what we build and whether it is moving the
needle

> We can’t jump on opportunities fast enough. We miss the window altogether

> There’s a basic lack of confidence. We never make a single deadline or
commitment

> Stuff keeps breaking and feels brittle

> I’m not holding out hope for the reorg. We’ve done this before

> It takes forever to gain any kind of consensus about how to move forward

> Getting new environments up and running takes them forever. We’ve been
waiting for weeks

> We outsourced that. And now they are unresponsive

> I have no idea what is going on. There’s no visibility!

> It’s impossible to work with this codebase. The most basic thing takes
forever

> We need better user stories. There are too many unknowns. They are not ready
for development

> Our estimates are way off! It is embarrassing

> How do you put a number on a table-stakes feature?

> Teams are always stepping on each other’s toes. What can we do?

> How about the team’s ideas? I think we’ve got some decent ideas

> There’s so much rework. We can’t seem to nail it on the first or second
tries

> The shift from projects to continuous flow has been very challenging

> The developers are lazy. Don’t quote me on that, but it’s true. What can I
do? I’m a developer and I’m calling the kettle black

> No one is clear on the roles and responsibilities. Everyone is confused
about that

> What’s missing is leadership. Plain and simple. Sad to say, but I’ve lost
trust

> Everything is OK. Not great. Not bad. I just feel we could do _better
_somehow

> We have to be able to settle on a definition of done, and acceptance
criteria! Without those, we’re lost

> Not everyone can be as vocal. What about introverts? How do we get our ideas
heard?

> Competitors are running circles around us. How do they do it?

> The roadmap is too prescriptive

> How far ahead of the work should we get?

> Poor alignment. We’ll agree on something, and then all go out and do
something different

> I’m trying to advocate for the value of exploratory testing! It isn’t a
brainless task

> The difference between our A and B players is massive. The A players become
overworked

> It is hard to hire good people. More than hard, actually. Maybe it is a
regional thing

> They don’t appreciate UX as a discipline. It’s frustrating, because I think
we add something

> How am I supposed to keep moving forward in my career? I feel like I’ve
stopped learning

> We are missing the big picture and get stuck down in the weeds

> I appreciate the idea of co-locating. But that’s impossible in this
situation, and the remote team feels alienated

> We don’t know when to stop working on something. When is enough, enough?

> Until the VPs stop fighting, we’ll just be waiting around and watching

> Getting new people up to speed is painful and slow. Things seem so complex

> People arrive and the best people leave like 6 months later. They get sick
of it

> It depends on the team, but for some people the environment is kind of toxic

> Do we retrain or rehire?

> The word “debt” has been cheapened. All I hear about is debt this, and debt
that

> I’m not positive they do it on purpose, but I could swear they are ignoring
our team’s requests

> It has been crunch time for months now. People are burnt out

> The distinction between PO and PM has been a tough one for us to figure out

> Too many meetings with nothing to show for it

> Faster, faster, faster. We’re running fast and loose at the moment. Does
that make sense for the situation?

> Can you measure the agility of a team? How are we supposed to improve, if we
can’t measure our teams?

> The senior team members are so cocky. I’m always scared about making a fool
of myself

> We’ll meet, figure stuff out, but taking it back to the team requires a full
reset

> Story splitting makes sense, but sometimes it seems like we are just going
through the motions

> QA needs to be involved earlier in the process!

> No one uses the Wiki. Don’t even get me started on writing tickets. Jira is
a mess

> Are we doing Agile right?

> Can’t complain. I’ve got a sweet job. Team is fun to work with. I’d be
happier if I had more say in what stack we use, but I’m nitpicking now

> The teams just go rogue, even when they lack the experience. How do we tame
that?

> Work piles up in the backlog. It’ll take months/years before we are able to
work on some of those items

> Management just swoops and poops with no notice. So frustrating

> Design is not something you can do on demand. It takes take alone to get it
right

> Why don’t we catch these bugs before they hit customers?

> At what point do we split the backend and frontend teams?

> It’s a chore to get access to the right tools. Always a hassle

> Details matter. The vision thing is fine, but that isn’t what gets work done

> Engineers are not robots

> Our tools aren’t up to date

> They (UX) are perfectionists. Always tweaking. Can’t we just ship it?

> I don’t know where the time went. Every sprint feels full on, but we don’t
seem to get much done

> That’s easy. We just don’t move fast enough. Great product can’t save us
unless we can deliver

> Right in the middle of the project we changed direction. All that work for
nothing

> What we’re doing is not scalable. We can’t grow it quickly enough

> I understand the idea of incremental improvements. But how can we make a big
leap that way?

> All they do is bring up more and more problems! We’re doing our best. We
can’t fix everything at once

> Do we take the plunge and refactor? Do we start over?

> The standups are a waste of time. Everything is “all good”, but it isn’t

> We mapped everything out on the wall. The net effect was noticing we are
slammed. And that hasn’t changed. Trying to do too much at once

> Shiny objects! We get in a groove, and then get distracted again and again

> People were thrown into management roles too early, in my opinion. I get the
feeling that some of them don’t even enjoy it

> The retrospectives seem like a waste of time. We don’t follow up on our
action items

> We seem to worry more about protecting our turf and department’s reputation,
than about doing a good job

> I find myself asking the same questions over and over. Can’t we codify some
of this learning?

> Maybe we are delivering too quickly for our customers. They can’t keep up
with the changes

> Since downsizing we are trying to do more stuff, with fewer people. Does
that make sense?

> There’s so much bureaucracy to get anything real done

> Move fast and break things. That’s what we do. But we leave them broken!

> We just worship the status quo. Don’t rock the boat! Don’t change stuff too
much

> How early do we get engineering involved? Too early, and sometimes it is a
big waste

> The team doubled in 12 months. I’d like to say we absorbed it gracefully,
but I’m not sure

> Pairing feels like such a waste of time. I work better alone, and pairing
tries my patience

> The POs are terrible. I wish I had a positive thing to say, but they’re
simply bad at their jobs

> I am hesitant about the consultants. What is their agenda? Why are they
here?

### 20 Ways to Kill Elephants (In Rooms)

#### Or just dance with them…

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*mct-FinIQlekRi-C29CQdQ.png)

<https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blind.JPG>

  * Attack the elephant head on during the budgeting process
  * Set a trap for the elephant. He’ll eventually overstep his bounds
  * Starve the elephant of attention and life-giving support and validation (to do this you must locate/control all sources of contributing energy, and have patience)
  * Introduce another elephant into the room, and let them fight for resources. Elephant jousting
  * Keep reminding people about the elephant with long emails. They’ll come around … eventually. Bonus: Reply All. Extra Bonus: Put the important bits at the end of the email
  * Persuade yourself that the elephant is much bigger than it appears and fight the good fight
  * Hire people to act as the elephant buffer. Build a human shield around the elephant and advocate externally for harmony and acceptance
  * Go to a conference, learn about complex adaptive systems, and tell everyone the story about [the blind men and the elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant) . That’ll blow everyone’s mind. We’re all the elephant dude…
  * Lure the elephant away from the room into another division
  * Talk incessantly about the elephant in 1:1s and repel with silent angst
  * Introduce a mouse into the room to antagonize the elephant
  * During retrospectives ask _why_ 5 times. Them: Elephant. Elephant. Elephant. Elephant. Elephant. You: We’re looking for root cause. Keep trying!
  * “Start with where you are” (elephant and all, Kanban Method style)
  * Build (or acquire) an innovation lab with barbed wire and 6ft thick walls. Sound proof it. Smuggle the work product out during cover of night, and hope that the elephant doesn’t take credit for it
  * Do nothing. Let the elephant leave/die when she is ready (or when company is disrupted and has to butcher the elephant for food)
  * Try to de-normalize the elephantine behavior with cultural manifestos and vague values that bear little resemblance to how people actually act
  * Try to transform the elephant into a more Agile / Teal / Lean elephant
  * Micro-services. Because, you know, micro-services. Micro-elephants with the AI power-up
  * Apply [methodology X] to organizational design. When it doesn’t work, listen to the consultants blame the elephant over drinks at the bar. If only…
  * Jump on the elephant! Become the invaluable elephant whisperer (aka “The Leadership Guru” or “). Write book, and become the darling of the exec set
  * Agree you need to rid yourself of the elephant (at an offsite, with trust activities and stickies), but get reminded a quarter later that the elephant pays the bills
  * Accept the elephant will outlive your stay. Retreat into craft and pragmatism until the time is right


# Play Your Own Game

We tend to obsess about hours per day/week worked.

* * *

### Play Your Own Game

We tend to obsess about hours per day/week worked.

> Look what that life-hacker gets done in thirty hours a week!

> Wow. They did that in their spare time in the evening working 10hrs weekly.

> He’s been pulling 60hr weeks for months now.

That’s the wrong metric.

Some people are sprinters. Some people are marathoners. Others are
steeplechasers, decathletes, and boxers. You can look over and say “wow, that
person is working a 12hr day, just like me”, but you don’t know what kind of
intensity they’re putting into their work.

If you burn super hot, you’ll destroy yourself doing a forty hour week. A
sustainable pace for you might be doing four hours of focused, distraction
free work. If you burn medium, you might be able to swing the 60 hour week and
still stay moderately productive. And then you have to figure in the impact
over the long haul. The sixty hour, medium-rare week might feel sustainable,
but only time will tell.

We’re told that if you “love your work” you’ll be “energized” by your work.
That might be true for some people, but it isn’t true for everyone. For some,
passionate work takes a great deal of energy and leaves you spent. Holding
yourself (and others) to that standard can be dangerous.

A big personal realization was that my “normal” is not “normal” (as in my
perception of normal). In eight hours I can dig myself a pretty big hole,
especially if I have time free for uninterrupted work. I work intensely. I run
the risk of overwhelming the people around me (and burning out). Trying to
keep up with coworkers leaves me at disadvantage.

But that’s just me. My friend Gloria describes her eight hour day as “pretty
chill”. She kills it, but without the same level of intensity. She’s more of a
marathoner.

So…look inwards and gauge your own energy. And accept that you’ll still have
distortions in how you sense time, output, and intensity. It’s “normal”.

### Talking Product: Running Themes from a Year of Conversations

I’ve talked to lots of product people (and engineers, UX, and agile coaches)
over the past year. I am commonly asked if certain themes bubble up again and
again. So I dug through my notes and recordings and looked for some running
themes, and then selected some exemplary quotes.

Some of these are verbatim (when I had the recording). Others were
reconstructed from copious notes.

#### Recruiting and churn is a big deal.

> We are having an incredibly hard time finding qualified PMs. It’s just so
hard to find that perfect fit. Our cross-functional teams are demanding
(especially the more senior developers and QA). The business is demanding. Our
customers are demanding. Attrition is high when we even fine them.  
> VP of Product

#### The plight of junior PMs, and the need for training

> Our track record when we place associate PMs directly on teams is abysmal. I
feel bad for them, and I feel bad for the teams. We’ve experimented with
training programs, but everyone is just so damn busy. They just don’t get it,
and I’m doing a terrible job helping them get it.  
> VP of Product

#### Need for product managers, the title, team assignments

> We’ve been questioning the need for PMs. I know we are _supposed _to have
one on each team. But do we really need one? How do they actually add value?
There’s a lot of confusion among our engineers and designers around the role
of the PM. I can see the need for a more senior PM for the whole product, but
it feels like we create “mini-products” just for kicks. It seems like another
role should exist, but I can’t describe it exactly.  
> Director of Engineering

#### Career development challenges

> Where do I go from here? I want to keep working with teams, but the only way
up is either to quit and join another company, or to move to another part of
the organization. Biz-dev maybe? Remember, there is one of us for between four
and six of “them” (engineers). Above me is a VP, and the reality is that we
only need a team that is _so big.  
> _Senior Product Manager

#### Tensions around using data in product development

> The engineering team talks about data all the time. We have two data
scientists at the whole company, and they are split across all of the
departments. They (the engineers) treat this like a science … like a big
machine learning experiment. I respect that, but we are simply not resourced
to do that. Even if we were, I don’t think it would be what they expect.
There’s serious tension at the moment around this topic. The product team
didn’t hire for these skills.  
> VP of Product

#### Filling the “gap” between the business and front-line teams

> About a decade ago we used to see the product manager as protecting the team
from the business. No one wanted to deal with the business, so we forced this
person to act as a go-between and to channel their needs. They were the
translation layer. It just isn’t like that anymore, honestly. And when it is —
when the team seems to be asking for that — we typically know something else
is going on.  
> Release Manager

#### Impact of velocity on product management

> Speed. Things are so blazing fast these days. We could release even more
often if we wanted to. This has put an immense amount of pressure on the
product management team. Maybe five years ago you could have argued “oh well,
this will take a while, we need to do more research”. Now there is a
definitive argument for just shipping and iterating. And killing the work if
we need to. I’m not sure that has stuck with everyone. You have this political
thing now with getting to iterate on something once shipped. On some level
that is a luxury!  
> Senior Product Manager

#### Engineer / product manager tensions

> The discussion is always about them and _their _product. Not _our _product.
Or it is about their ideas. You would think that they believe no one is
watching. We see what is happening with what we build. We look at the metrics.
We see the shifts in strategy when stuff goes wrong. They return from “high
profile” meetings with our “new direction”. Yes, this sounds bitter.  
> Engineer

#### Teams taking on product management responsibilities

> The interesting thing, is that as the individuals on the teams matured, we
started to see a changing role for product. The teams became more self-
sufficient. Without a PM/PO, we could hand them a problem — even a sort of
nebulous one — and they’d make progress. That changed the game for the PM, and
made it easier in some regards, but also harder. The game is more complicated.  
> Director of Engineering

#### Looking for an edge…

> I’d say things are good. We are always looking for that extra edge. The
discussions these days are more about metrics and how we measure our efforts.
Or how to really get UX working directly with engineers. That kind of stuff.
There is this sense that there must be something better out there that we are
not doing. The business is doing well, also, which hopefully is due in part to
our work. If there was a downturn things could get pretty dicey.  
> CEO

#### Growth and debt challenges

> It is easy to blame the product manager in this case. So convenient! But
taking a step back, our team is digging out from serious technical and
leadership debt. There’s only so much we can do at the moment. We grew and
grew, and now we are dealing with it. I’d say that half of the crap we’re
dealing with is self-inflicted because we are so nervous nothing is actually
getting done.  
> COO

#### Organization design and silos

> We’ve toyed with combining our product and engineer departments to form a
single product development group. I think we’ve got it under control at the
moment, but at a certain point the cultural differences between the
departments will come back to bite us. At the start, that’s how we worked. But
as we grew, the more loose “departments” became hardened. Throw UX into the
mix — now aligned with the product organization — and you have a lot of moving
parts.  
> CTO

#### Coaching and product owners

> My role is to help the teams, including the product owner. Repeatedly, I see
the product owner as the source of friction. At one point we had to do
retrospectives without the product owner present because the situation got
that bad. The blame rests on everyone’s shoulders, but I find myself spending
most of my time trying to help the product owners.  
> Agile Coach

#### Respect and trust

> Respect is so easily lost, and so hard to build up again. We have a strong
engineering culture, and to be blunt, we don’t suffer fools lightly. If the PM
seems manipulative, waffling, or unsure … the teams pounce.  
> Engineer


# The Learning Styles Myth and User Onboarding

you’ll often hear comments like:

### The Learning Styles Myth and User Onboarding

When talking about the role of learning in onboarding, or in SaaS in general,
you’ll often hear comments like:

> You know, some people learn by just clicking around, some like to read the
manual, some just want to get their first task done, some are quick to call
technical support. People just have different learning styles.

It’s true that people differ in many ways when they arrive at a new feature or
product. But unpacking the idea of learning styles can dispel some myths about
instruction and give us some better insight.

The fields of educational psychology and instructional design can teach us a
lot about what makes for effective learning in onboarding. The notion that
people have a dominant learning style (visual, auditory, verbal, kinesthetic)
and learn best when instruction is tailored to that style is still widespread.

Surprisingly, though, this concept [doesn’t really hold up to
research](http://blog.cathy-moore.com/2015/06/how-to-respond-to-learning-
style-believers/). For one, although every person has strengths and weaknesses
and preferences, there isn’t any indication that those differences neatly fit
into a half-dozen or so defined styles. Second, studies are much more likely
to show that, regardless of personal preference, people learn best when
instruction methods are tailored to the type of content being taught.

So, if neat-and-tidy learning styles are largely a myth, what can we take from
instructional design research? We know that software users vary in their
goals, background, motivation, and preferences for how to learn, and that that
variation is far more complex than just learning styles. What affects users’
learning preferences?

  * Their goals and sense of urgency
  * Their willingness to try new things (one of the [“big five” personality traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits))
  * Cultural context and organizational culture context
  * Generational differences — people raised around computers and the web tend to have different approaches to information than those who weren’t
  * Incentives, potential rewards, potential costs
  * Different cognitive strengths and weaknesses
  * Technical savvy
  * Reading styles ([methodical versus scanning](http://www.slideshare.net/coolstuff/poynter-eyetracking-study-march-07/20-Scanning_readers_tend_to_Scan))

The list could go on and on! How can we approach learning for all of these
users? Looking at the instructional design literature, there are principles
and models that work and transcend learning styles. This is fertile ground
when considering your onboarding. One example is Gagne’s Nine Events for a
learner approaching and retaining any new information:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*R-k_a3w3TYQbDgtmZ2-qoQ.png)

<http://check-n-click.com/pin-up-resource-gagnes-nine-events/>

The situation of onboarding, however, often puts us farther from the moment of
learning than either a classroom teacher or an online course or tutorial
designer. Two concepts from education that can help us tackle this case are
self-directed learning and scaffolding.

#### Self-Directed Learning

Self-directed learning is a broad concept, but one clearly fits the situation
of an adult learner working in a digital environment with access to the vast
array of information on the web. In [self-directed
learning](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/suren-ramasubbu/is-learning-
increasingly-_b_7154164.html), learners “take the initiative, with or without
the help of others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning
goals, identifying human and material resources for learning, choosing and
implementing appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning
outcomes.” This fits with a user trying to get up to speed on a software
product. But, whether a student struggling to navigate the vast amounts of
information available digitally or a user trying to find what she needs in a
manual, overload is often the problem. Feeling overwhelmed by the number of
functions in an application often leads to users [skipping over available
documentation](http://digitalcommons.utep.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&context=cs_papers)
and this has led to the increasing minimal manual movement.

#### Scaffolding

How can we help self-directed learners swim a sea of information? [As this
article points out](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/suren-ramasubbu/is-learning-
increasingly-_b_7154164.html), this is a good niche for the educational
principle of scaffolding. The idea of scaffolding is that students learn by
being assisted as they attempt new tasks. As their proficiency grows, the
instructor gradually withdraws the support mechanism. In a traditional
classroom, the scaffold may consist of help from the teacher, or an exercise
that breaks a skill into simplified steps. But in an onboarding scenario,
there are different opportunities and options for scaffolding. In self-
directed learning, the “teacher” or resource can take many forms: content,
resource locator, motivator, and prompt for reflection and evaluation.

Of course, teaching is only part of what onboarding does. In addition to
improving learning in onboarding, we have to see the larger picture.
Onboarding itself can be assigned personas like coach, tour guide, concierge,
salesperson, librarian, and others. But when it seeks to teach, it’s best to
strive for excellent teaching suited to the content and the situation rather
than get bogged down in learning styles. Try to conceptualize how your
onboarding can help the self-directed learner get where they need to go.

### #NoEstimates. Two Different Problems

_If you’re not familiar with the #NoEstimates “debate”, try searching Twitter
for the #NoEstimates hash-tag. You have been forewarned._

It was probably silly to re-enter the fray, but I did…

> [](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/817462942186602497)

An explanation…

#### Risk Management

Risk management, compliance, and governance are extremely important. Spending
people’s money irresponsibly is fraudulent. When you’re paying for something,
it helps to have some sense of what you’re getting, when you’re getting it,
and how it will perform (even if you don’t have all the answers upfront). All
of this is _true_.

#### Underperforming Organizations

Many software development organizations (and the organizations they serve) are
not realizing their potential for value delivery. We’re not talking 8/10. No…
they performing at 1/5th or 1/10th of their capabilities (or more). They do
not deliver value continuously. Their practices are unsafe. And they fail to
learn and experiment. I’m not one for the 10x engineer thing. But I do believe
in (and have experienced, and measured) 10x organizations … and 1x
organizations.

* * *

So you have risk management on one side. Important. And you have poorly
performing organizations on the other side. Important.

Take a dysfunctional, under-performing organization and ask them what is
important and they’re likely to talk about “accountability, predictability,
hitting deadlines, and execution”. When you take a step back, what you often
see is that the org is battling a local maximum. Yes, those things are
symptoms of the problem, but the real problem runs deeper.

Chances are they’re battling a significant amount of organizational and
technical debt. There’s a lack of safety, humanity, passion, engagement, and
motivation. Sure, you can do a stellar job of risk management — and I truly
admire people who can do this well — but it belies the fact that you are eking
out a downhill 85mph run in an old Pinto, and there’s an 80% likelihood you’ll
make it from California to New York in 57.7hrs provided you pee quickly and
run the fuel tank to the red-zone.

The problem is that the _exact same practices_ — in _different contexts_ — can
constitute either 1) humane, reasonable conversations and a hearty effort to
help out the people involved, or 2) theatrics, hand-offs, command-and-
manipulate, and pass-the-buck. The _exact same practices. _One org’s
governance and compliance is a source of competitive advantage and employee
pride. Another org’s governance and compliance is their achilles heel, and
will lead to their disruption.

From my perspective, the #NoEstimates crew is focusing on the 80% of orgs that
have far bigger issues than estimates. They are trying to get a heartbeat
going … some flow, some focus, some breathing room, and some / any value
delivered. They are asking “how do you go from a 2x org to an 8x org?” and
stripping away the excess to answer that question. Trying to define _estimate_
is a rabbit hole in this particular conversation, and is almost beside the
point.

#NoEstimates detractors find this utterly irresponsible, as they are risk
management / project management pros and they live/breath this stuff. If I
needed a guidance system for my missile developed, I’d go to a #NoEstimates
detractor. If I was looking to turn around my company early in the game, I’d
go to a #NoEstimates advocate. Manage an outside contractor or assist my teams
with project work (vs. product work)… #NoEstimates detractor. We are talking
about two fundamentally different problems that happen to share the word
“estimates” _occasionally_.

The sad thing is that there are many skilled folks on both sides (of this
accidental, word inspired debate) that have a ton of great information to
share. And they do share! They contribute to the community in their respective
domains. But when I hear from people who are too _afraid _to join the
discussion for fear of being beaten down and harassed … then we have a
problem. It’s not productive and/or effective.

Sad really. I’d love to learn more about risk management, continuos value
delivery, and defeating the local maxima in under-performing orgs.


# Completed != Validated

Change your ticket statuses to beat the feature factory

* * *

### Completed != Validated

#### Change your ticket statuses to beat the feature factory

Words matter.

When we discuss “definition of done” we often forget the needs and goals of
our customers, users, and business (the true arbiters of done-ness). Closed
(or Completed in some companies) is a status value that effectively removes
the item from the team’s plate, records a completed-by date, and contributes
to the sprint’s story-point goal. Sure the story may be done and ready to
ship, but have we validated that the work is having the desired effect?
Accepted is no better. It is still not validated.

> But the story is part of a bigger epic! The story is done, even if the Epic
is not done. Actually, it can’t even really be shipped independently. Unless
we mark it done, and give it a narrow definition of done, it will muddy up our
dashboards!

If this is the case, you are missing the [I in
INVEST](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/invest/). The story cannot be
released _independently_ of other stories. It is not Valuable unto itself (the
V). Teams often run into this issue when they 1) are afraid to assign multiple
people to a single story, and 2) force the splitting of stories to obey the S
in Invest (Small), but do so at the expense of the integrity and user-focus of
their stories.

That still doesn’t really cut to the root of the problem. Our definitions of
done are not usually stated as desired outcomes. They are fancy specs.
Shipping is the goal, and the words we use (like Closed and Completed for
stories) only reinforce that. The desired outcome is lost somewhere in a PM’s
slides (or head).

To beat the [factory factory](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-
in-a-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2), you need to change your mindset. You have
to stop configuring your tools to reinforce the idea of a feature factory, and
adherence to Scrum “rules” that are often way too prescriptive. Yes, dev-
focused “tasks” are easier to grok than user-focused stories, but that’s what
ticket hierarchies are for. Most tools give you the power to rename your
status values.

How about Ready to Validate and Validated? Don’t let your tools and words mold
you. Need to show more logical nesting, and the validation cycle? Then show
it! Need longer sprints to actually deliver customer value. Lengthen them.
Think about the behavior you want — delivering validated customer value, not
feature bloat — and mold your tools and words around that.

So much process. So little indication of the work working …

# We Are What We Learn

When I talk to teams about data and evidence-driven product development, I
invariably encounter some fear and trepidation:

### We Are What We Learn

When I talk to teams about data and evidence-driven product development, I
invariably encounter some fear and trepidation:

“What if we measure the wrong thing?”

“What if the data shows no one is using that feature?”

“I’m not sure I really trust their analysis. It’s oversimplified!”

“We don’t have the budget for a data scientist!”

But knowledge is power, right? What are we so afraid of? Plenty. Data can
decide which initiatives are green-lighted or canned, which efforts have had
an impact, whether to increase or decrease headcounts, when to fire customers,
and when to pivot or proceed. This isn’t trivial stuff!

Sometimes fear holds us back from seeking data; other times efforts to use
data never bear fruit. Not for lack of trying — plenty of companies invest
massively in BI, analytics, data quality, eliminating data silos, etc. But
somehow, this yields no new insights and no changes in direction. Somehow all
prior assumptions and biases are confirmed, and it’s business as usual.

If there is one thing that the fear of data and failed attempts of data usage
have in common, it is the use of data for management, rather than for
learning.. These organizations miss the difference between instrumentation and
new insights. With KPIs, performance is _indicated_ and you’re checking
conformance to a predetermined plan. Measurement in this case is used _as a
management tool._

We’ve been told we are what we measure, and that we can’t manage what we can’t
measure. I’d flip that a bit to say that we are what we learn. And if we need
to learn something, we likely need to step out of the management-by-
measurement mentality. Whatever it is, we don’t know it yet! To learn it, we
need to be open to improvisation and experimentation. To quote H. Thomas
Johnson, “Perhaps what you measure is what you get. More likely, what you
measure is all you’ll get.”

Try asking yourself and your team these key questions:

  * What did we learn this month?
  * What must we learn more about next?
  * How should we try to learn about it?

These question are asked far too infrequently compared to questions like
“What’s the velocity,” “When will we finish,” “Is [person] performing,” and
“Are we on target to hit the revenue goal?” The end result is that teams end
up:

  * Not practicing, paralyzed by how to get started
  * Not exploring different methods and perspectives
  * Not addressing data quality issues for _new _areas of measurement
  * Not enjoying learning wins as a source of energy and buy-in

You have to make learning a regular part of your work. To make this happen, I
have found it helpful to convene a cross-functional learning team. Ideally
this team should meet regularly (weekly or biweekly) to keep the momentum
going. To make your learning team effective:

1\. Form a team drawing from different parts of your organization. This is
vital. By making this a team sport, you’re cross-pollinating learnings,
methods, question framing skills and more. In addition to generating new
learning, the goal is to leave everyone a bit more data-savvy and excited
about learning with data.

2\. Visualize a learning workflow (parallel to any ticketing systems or other
project roadmaps) and make a commitment to moving your questions through it.
Your best bet is to keep things conservative in terms of the amount of
learning work in-progress. Below is a sample work flow. Note how I’ve divided
in-progress questions into two potential workflows: one where the data is
available and must be gathered and cleaned before analysis, and the other
where some sort of experiment must be designed and run.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*hxVhIjIir7aUKi-8TiB1Tg.png)

3\. Engage a data-savvy coach from inside your organization. Ideally you’ll
have someone with a strong data science background to act as a coach and
technical advisor. This analysis coach helps pair questions and learning goals
with the appropriate analysis technique and provides learning resources to get
people working through learning projects on their own. If the team or
individual hits an impasse, the coach should help out, but the goal is to
teach people how to fish.

4\. Share the learnings inside and outside the learning team. Learning is
contagious! Many teams forget what new insights feel like. They’re hyper-
acclimated to thinking about measurement for management (and we HIT this goal)
vs. measurement for learning. It’s also important to share your learnings on
gathering your learnings. Reflect on the techniques you used and challenges
you encountered (especially with access to data and data quality).

If your team feels anxious about data or your efforts at data-driven
development fall flat, think about how you’re using data. What are you
measuring and what are you learning? Learning is often overlooked, but crucial
for real insights.

### Trello, “Jira Sucks”, and Tool Dysfunction

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*ozKxyhUOeYpIigJjGtN9pg.png)

I love [Trello](https://medium.com/u/fb5dd2d116a1) because there are very few
ways you can screw it up. You simply don’t use Trello for the “more
complicated” workflows because it fails miserably (thank god). It’s simple,
fast, no frills, and helps you focus on collaborating with other people and
getting work done. And that’s OK. I’m very happy that
[Atlassian](https://medium.com/u/5aa6b9976187) — a company I respect and
admire — [has purchased Trello.](https://hackernoon.com/what-the-trello-
acquisition-means-for-atlassian-6a21ef7ac169#.mem6innxb)

> But John, Jira sucks! Maybe the Trello pixie dust will rub off on Jira…

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*MhmjV3gNgZe383L0IUAUVA.png)

I think that is a vast oversimplification, and shows very little sympathy to
the challenges faced by Atlassian (and the advantages the Trello team
enjoyed). The problem isn’t Jira.

The problem is that we inevitably come to hate every issue tracking product we
use. We hate them because we (the users) overload/customize them with the best
of intentions, and then our needs change. And finally because businesses see
these tools as some sort of necessary evil: a management tool instead of a
catalyst to drive better customer outcomes and inspire continuous improvement.
If front-line teams could link their use of said tools to better individual
and customer outcomes, they’d like them.

Great case in point. My friend proclaimed “I hate Trello!” Turns out he
started working at a company that had butchered it beyond recognition to
“manage” an incredibly bloated process. It only takes one bout of food
poisoning. And…we tend to graft team dysfunction on the tools we use. If we’re
always frustrated when using Jira, we’ll associate it with Jira! A tangled
process implemented in Jira remains tangled.

#### Discouraging Continuous Improvement

Tools tend to force premature convergence on a process, and then make it
ridiculously inconvenient to change that process. The tool is running the
team, and not the other way around. Teams should be encouraged to continuously
improve on the way they work. Are two week sprints too long, or too short? Can
we clarify our working agreements? Is the team driving a new value stream? Do
we need to shift things around to address a bottleneck? Should we flag items
for pairing? Mob? Add a new layer to the ticket hierarchy? Teams should be
able to adapt accordingly.

#### Customized Into Oblivion

To complicate the issue, the more you try to customize tools to make everyone
happy (and to make the job they have right now easier), the more bloated and
inflexible the user experience becomes. That magic executive-level dashboard
is now a reality, but at the expense of letting teams reflect and adapt on how
they work (and likely burdening them with non-customer facing administrative
work, aka the dreaded “update your tickets, everyone!”).

What you see in many cases is that the business is still in a waterfall
mindset, and that a good bit of our tool customization is centered around that
translation layer.

#### Benefits

You’ve gotta ask … how is the team _actually benefiting_ from using the
product? Is the tool helping them deliver _more value to their customers_?
When I ask this, I’ll **often hear** about benefits like tracking,
accountability, visibility, estimation, managing dependencies, status checks,
notifications, executive roll-ups, and reporting. I **hear very little** about
improved collaboration, better insights, improved quality, more effective
retrospectives, and increased team motivation / sense of ownership / clarity
of mission. I **almost never hear** about improved end-customer outcomes.

Ask an engineer or UXD “what tools help you build better more usable software”
and they’ll have an answer. It won’t be the ticketing/workflow product.

#### Hmmmm

Anyway. That is what’s on my mind today. Are the tools running the team, and
not the other way around? Is your tooling delivering better outcomes to your
customers, or just making everyone feel better internally? Do all of those
layers of customization really add value?

Also, do we always fail when trying to to mix workflow, continuous improvement
efforts, and collaboration on tickets in a single tool? I always advise teams
to work with a physical board to reflect on and tweak how they work. And THEN
pick a tool. Instead, teams figure they’ll “do Agile”, figure everyone does
Scrum to the book, and buy a tool to enforce said process. It rarely ends
well.

### Product vs. Single Projects (and 8x Teams)

[A couple posts ago](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/noestimates-two-
different-problems-b4f37d29ce5d#.35gaa53lr), I mentioned something about teams
improving their capacity for value delivery “by 8x”. Someone I respect
questioned that claim, which in turn lead to an interesting conversation.

#### Single Project

Take a narrowly defined project in isolation. Assume the customer can describe
exactly what they need (by the way, I think this is actually _possible_ in
some domains, others would disagree). Prescribe a tech stack. Measure the
outcome based on how much the project _costs_, when it is _completed_, and
conformance to some sort of spec. Run the test over and over on different, but
similarly skilled teams. In this case, and against these metrics, I don’t
think you’ll ever see one team outperform another team by 800%.

Maybe a crude example … ask 50 similarly sized expert home building teams to
build a single house to plan, and you wont see one team build it in 2w and one
team build it in 16w.

#### SaaS Product

Take another scenario. A company wants to make as much revenue as possible
while at the same time retaining their existing customers. The company
delivers their software via web browsers to 20,000 customers, and earns the
bulk of its revenue from monthly subscription fees. In this case, I think it
is entirely possible for the best teams to produce 8x the revenue (or more).
Why? The best/better teams would likely…

  * Pick/choose what to continue building based on outcomes and validation. The best teams would double-down on fewer initiatives
  * Get multiple shots at solving certain problems. The customer doesn’t receive the end-product one day and walk away
  * Evolve tight feedback loops (days, instead of months/quarters)
  * Hire new team members based on feedback loops. Hiring alone in a complex, evolving product domain can be a huge differentiator
  * Evolve their tech stack to meet new challenges (it becomes part of the product). This is where devops comes in. Keep debt low
  * Leverage economies of scale across their large customer base
  * Avoid custom solutions for specific customers (not necessary)
  * Might choose to offer a platform offering and create a developer ecosystem
  * Etc.

Again, probably a bad example … but imagine a construction company toying with
prefab, new materials, variable floor plans, 1000s of homes, etc. I could see
one generating 8x the revenue.

In short, they can beat the [feature/project
factory](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-
44a5b938d6a2#.ns8x01yum) approach, which opens up all sorts of opportunities
for optimizing value delivery. I repeatedly see large enterprise software
product companies with vast resources get shellacked by small, nimble teams.
Or even on a very local level the relative performances of UX Research or
Growth teams.

This is the 8x I’m talking about. The distance between the best and the
mediocre is great.

The differences here make comparisons difficult. You’ll hear someone talking
about product development practices, and it will sounds completely foreign. Or
someone talking about competitive contract work, and their challenges will
seem foreign as well. Context is everything!

### The 20 Jobs Of In-App Messaging

Great in-app messaging is an extension of your product’s UX, and of your
organization as a whole. Those pixels, prompts, and flows have a style and a
voice, and show up to work every day (24hrs a day, without fail, without
coffee) to get the job done.

Nailing down that job is critical. It’s easy to jump straight to drawings and
mockups, or try to accomplish too many things at once. The goal of this post
is to get you out of the weeds (and your app) and trigger the creative juices.
We ask: “If the in-app messaging was a person, what would that person’s job
(or jobs) be?” In this post, we present twenty(!) possible personas for in-app
messaging.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*ztdvmPFk0F6yJMiDbXu0vg.png)

Who does your product (and your users) need to hire?

#### Coach

The coach is all about your big goals and the plan for how to get there. It’s
the coach’s job to take that path to glory and break it down into achievable
steps. Along the way, she keeps track of progress and keeps you accountable —
if you’re not showing up to workouts, she’ll let you know you’re off-track.
The coach is also a motivator who reminds you to celebrate the intermediate
steps on the way to your goal, who checks in on your well-being and cares,
even if she has to take you to task now and again.

#### Teacher

The teacher wants to help you master a particular skill. That means getting
your attention, building your understanding of the basic concepts, showing you
how to apply your learning in the real world, and keeping it all lively and
engaging. A good teacher knows the subject matter and finds it interesting
himself. Teaching can be very focused and brief (_show me how to do this!_) or
broad and mind-expanding (_teach me about this field!_).

#### Usher

The usher keeps everyone moving along toward a particular goal, knows the
layout of the product top to bottom, and understands how traffic needs to
flow. The usher welcomes you, makes sure you have your ticket, and points you
to where you need to go. The interaction is friendly, helpful, and brief — the
show must go on!

#### Tour guide

The tour guide learns your interests and uses that information to plan a good
tour. She has deep knowledge of the points of interest along the route and
what areas will be valuable to you. More than a teacher or a product
demonstrator, the tour guide wants to keep you engaged by telling a great
story. You find yourself in suspense, listening intently to find out the
mystery behind that spooky landmark over there. You’re learning a lot, but
you’re enjoying the ride.

#### Maître d’

The maître d’ is there to oversee your total experience. Waiters and others
may handle the details, but the maître d’ just wants to make sure you’re
happy. He checks in. Are you having a good time? Are things going smoothly?
How is the atmosphere? Is the music too loud? The maître d’ is proactive, but
takes a big-picture perspective.

#### Analyst

The analyst is your eye on the data. An expert to provide insights on the
important trends and a forecaster to help you understand where things are
going. An savvy adviser who connects disparate threads that you might not have
seen and offers _Did you know…?_ insights. She helps you make sense of the
information and see your path forward.

#### Lawyer

When you need one, you need one. Someone has to take care of the legal details
and help you understand what you need to know in all of that fine print. The
lawyer presents you with terms and conditions, makes you feel comfortable
accepting them, and explains the privacy policy.

#### Demonstrator

You’ve seen this persona on late-night TV. A good product demonstrator puts on
a good show. He’s charismatic, energetic, and skilled at drawing people in.
You learn by watching the product in action. You know it’s a bit of a sales
pitch, but somehow you can’t turn away as the demonstrator walks you through
all the features and possibilities of the product. _Yes, it’s just that easy!_

#### Greeter

The greeter isn’t going to follow you around for long, but wants to make sure
you have a good first impression. The greeter makes you feel welcome and
quickly assesses your needs and disposition. Based on that, she quickly frames
what’s possible (Yes, we have what you’re looking for!) and points you in the
right direction.

#### Cashier

In a self-service model, you might not need much assistance once you’re ready
to make the purchase, but you need someone to help you with those last few
details. You might need to clarify a couple of questions about pricing or how
things work, and you count on the cashier to help with those. But, mostly,
you’re ready to buy and the cashier creates a clear and friendly path through
the transaction.

#### Lifeguard

The lifeguard is always on the lookout to make sure you’re safe and keep you
out of trouble. She proactively creates a safe environment through signage and
warnings, and, if something bad happens, can swoop in with speed and agility
to help out. You can relax and do your thing knowing that someone is there if
danger arises.

#### Customer service representative

While the lifeguard may prevent catastrophe, sometimes you need help with a
particular problem. The service representative is your problem troubleshooter.
He is there to calm you down and works to quickly understand the nature of
your problem. Unlike a teacher, who might build your skills by helping you
find your own solution, the service representative presents a highly
prescriptive solution as soon as possible. You need help now, and the service
person is there to get you on your way.

#### Cheering squad

You’ve got a lot of work to do and someone needs to keep your morale up! The
cheering squad celebrates your victories and encourages you to keep at it when
the going gets tough. They cue up the band and bring the positivity when you
need to avoid getting discouraged.

#### Researcher

The researcher is a mediator between the customer and the company and is all
about asking questions and gathering insights. She has her own agenda composed
of learning goals and seeks out people of interest to get the necessary
information. She wants to establish a friendly dialogue, but to do good
information-gathering, she needs to remain unbiased and not try to sway your
responses.

#### Personal assistant

The personal assistant helps you out by staying one step ahead of the details.
He’s an expeditor in complex situations, making arrangements and smoothing out
wrinkles. The personal assistant takes care of the busy work and knows what
needs to happen to help you get something done. You feel like you can relax a
bit more when your personal assistant is on the job.

#### Bulletin board

The bulletin board is an information hub for the community. It’s where you go
to keep up with news, updates, and items of interest. Having this go-to helps
to build general awareness and knowledge, assuming that you are eager to stay
in the loop.

#### Emergency Broadcast Announcer

_Beeeeeep….beeeeeep….chhhhrrrrrrrr. _When it’s not just a test, the emergency
broadcast announcer gets the word out that something is happening. The stakes
are high and people need to know. They get right to the point and explain the
impact of a situation concisely.

#### Closer

_What do I need to do to get you into this car today? _The closer is there to
seal the deal and make the sale. The closer is persuasive and focused on
finalizing things in a timely fashion. The value of the closer to the business
is obvious, but the closer’s value to the customer is all about timing. If
it’s too soon, you hate the closer. If you’re tired of mulling it over and
want to make this decision and move forward, the closer can be just what you
need.

#### Traffic signaler

Maybe your teacher taught you how to drive and your usher gave you directions,
but you’re running into a snarl. The destination is the same, but the way to
get there has changed. There is a new traffic pattern, or construction that
has complicated your usual route. You need someone with clear signals (and
perhaps a sign or two) to slow you down and help you navigate.

#### Reference librarian

The reference librarian is all about keeping track of information. She has all
the available resources on the tip of her tongue and can help you understand
what information is available and where to find it. More importantly, she
knows that there are multiple ways to find and categorize each item, can find
a route to the information you need from more than one starting point, and can
help you see how resources are related.


# Unvalidated Complexity is a Liability

### Unvalidated Complexity is a Liability

David Frahm asked me to explain this Tweet:

> [](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/830500858651570176)

> [](https://twitter.com/davidfrahm/status/830537461415673856)

So what is the liability?

Complexity can kill the future ability of a team to seize opportunities and
change course. Any developer who has worked on a bloated codebase can attest
to this. Any support engineer who has had to support a bloated set of features
understands this. Any marketer who has had to market to dozens of personas
understands this. I’m not suggesting being risk adverse. But leaving
features/interface/integration points in your product “just because” is a
recipe for eventual collapse of the system.

The problem is that complexity is often invisible, and its impacts are non-
linear. I wish folks would do the “remove a feature for every feature you add”
approach more seriously.

Let’s take a rapidly growing startup. A broad product appealing to many
personas will be easier to sell. Being able to say “yes, we do that” works
great on phone calls. You’ll grow quickly. But what you are essentially doing
is passing the buck to your future self. At some point you’ll need to increase
your team size exponentially, development will slow to a crawl, marketing will
drown trying to appeal to everyone, and the whole house of cards will come
tumbling down.

The answer isn’t fear or being risk adverse. Or going slowly. But the cult of
velocity seems to only address speed of output, and not speed of
validation/learning. We tend to ignore velocity of learning. I think the
reason so many UXers and Devs have come to despise the idea of MVPs is that
they work in environments where they are asked to cut corners (introduce
complexity), and then never get a chance to act on that learning. MVP = crappy
guess and deal with it. The cycle time for learning is infinity.


# Usability Principles and Onboarding

### Usability Principles and Onboarding

With onboarding, the focus is often on the particular and more particular. Who
is your user? What are her goals? What is going on at this very moment in his
interaction with the app? In this post, though, we’ll take a step back to
bring overarching principles of usability to the discussion.

Usability heuristics are widely recognized principles that guide (or should
guide) all software and user interface design. Heuristic evaluation provides a
way to examine how well a process meets these overall goals for user
experience and pinpoint possible trouble spots.

Two well-known sets of usability heuristics were developed by Jakob Nielsen
and Bruce Tognazzini, respectively. Nielsen’s heuristics (which can be[ found
here](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)) were
released in their current form in 1994 and are some of the most used for user
interface design. Tognazzini, who designed Apple’s first human interface and
wrote _First Principles of Interaction Design_ developed another set of
heuristics (which can be[ found here](http://asktog.com/atc/principles-of-
interaction-design/)). There is overlap between these two, and here we’ll
review how some principles found in both can be applied to onboarding:

**_“Bring to the user all the information and tools needed for each step of the process.” -Tognazzini_**

**_“Visibility of system status” -Nielsen_**

The user should have a clear understanding of what is going on at all times.
Status information should be visible, accurate, and continuous, keeping the
user oriented. This chain of information should remain clear during
onboarding.

Keeping the user aware of status helps create a positive onboarding
experience. Poorly designed onboarding where the user doesn’t know what is
going on can be overwhelming and confusing. Status feedback should answer
questions like: Where am I in the overall process? Am I creating real data,
and will my entries be saved? Is this working? Is it loading?

**_“The most important consistency is consistency with user expectations.*” -Tognazzini_**

**_“Match between system and the real world” -Nielsen_**

Usability is defined by meeting users where they are. Systems should strive to
work with existing user behaviors and knowledge when possible. The verbal and
visual language of an app should match the language and conceptual
understanding of the user, not the developers.

If users are accustomed to working a certain way in your app, then it’s best
for your onboarding to conform to that pattern, whether it’s “right” or not.
When adding an onboarding experience to an existing application, it’s easy to
introduce inconsistency. In addition to being frustrated by unfamiliar
functionality, users will distrust overlays, tooltips, and walk-throughs that
don’t match the visual styling of the rest of the product. Pay close attention
to content, styling, placement of buttons, rules for advancing and exiting,
etc., and strive for consistency and familiarity.

**_“Use Active Discovery to guide people to more advanced features.” -Tognazzini_**

**_“Recognition rather than recall” -Nielsen_**

Active discovery means that, instead of waiting for users to discover an
interface item, we directly offer it to them. This kind of process is the core
concept of onboarding. However, it works best in balance with Nielsen’s
concept of user education, in which it’s important to minimize memory demands
for the user.

For active discovery to work, you need to anticipate when the user will need
something. An onboarding experience that introduces advanced features that the
user won’t need for a week contributes to cognitive overload and is unlikely
to be useful. You also need to figure out how to remind users of features
without overloading them with reminders.

**_“Give users well-marked roads and landmarks, then let them shift into four-wheel drive.” and “Sometimes you have to provide deep ruts.”-Tognazzini_**

**_“Flexibility and efficiency of use” -Nielsen_**

These principles speak to the balance between direction and user freedom. We
want advanced users to be able to move more quickly, while still giving enough
guidance to inexperienced users. With onboarding, it’s easy to think in terms
of a very linear progression, but making that too strict is at odds with user
freedom. When and where should we give the user the opportunity to “shift into
four-wheel drive” and advance past steps? If we’re providing deep ruts, is
there a benefit that justifies the structure and is clear to the user?

The concept of landmarks is also relevant for onboarding. Multi-step
onboarding experiences can feel unsettling when when other parts of the
interface are obscured. Convey a sense of place by using familiar landmarks.
The next step in an onboarding sequence should also be visible. Difficulty
finding the next step drains users’ reserve of attention.

**_“Make actions reversible.” -Tognazzini_**

**_“User control and freedom” -Nielsen_**

In Nielsen’s words, “Users often choose system functions by mistake and will
need a clearly marked ‘emergency exit’ to leave the unwanted state without
having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.”

In onboarding experiences, always keep the user’s exit option in mind. Guiding
someone through a long series of steps without a clear sense of being able to
“back out” will leave your users very anxious. It’s calming to hear “you can
review your order at any time” or “feel free to go back and check things
over.”

Avoid form workflows where there is no legitimate ability to go back and undo
past steps. And, when you ask a user to experiment with a new interface,
assuage their fear that they will mess things up. When the user is
experimenting, make it clear that “this is just a test project” or that “you
can’t mess up.”

**_“Make it easy and attractive to stay in.” -Tognazzini_**

**_“Consistency and standards” and “Visibility of system status” -Nielsen_**

This principle emphasizes that people are more likely to stick with a task
when they know where they are and how to move around as needed, and ties in
with the general themes of consistency and keeping the user oriented. If you
reduce stress and cognitive load for the users, it’s easier for them to engage
with your app longer.

One common application of this principle is that you should not force users to
rely on their browser’s back button to go backwards. Test this out in your
onboarding progression. Can users reliably move backwards and forwards without
using the browser button? If they do use the browser button, what will happen?

**_“Use Progressive Revelation to flatten the learning curve.” -Tognazzini_**

**_“Recognition rather than recall” -Nielsen_**

Progressive revelation is a technique that spreads information and actions
over several screens in order to avoid overwhelming the user. Information
typically moves from broad and abstract to more specific, or interactions move
from simple to complex. In this way, the user has a chance to gradually become
familiar with complex sites or applications. This is in keeping with the idea
that information should be provided in ways that reduce the user’s memory load
— small pieces of information, close to where they’re needed.

Progressive revelation, or progressive disclosure, is central to onboarding.
But you should always be balancing the number of options and the amount of
information. Too many options or too much information create cognitive
overload. Too little limits the user’s sense of control. Think about the ways
that your onboarding can pace information to facilitate learning.

Important to remember is that checking your onboarding (or any process)
against these usability heuristics is _not a substitute for usability
testing_. The heuristics serve to make sure you’re on the right track and may
provide some bursts of insight, but for each case, you need to make sure that
the details of what you’re doing for your target persona in this exact
situation are working effectively.

*This heuristic, presented by Tognazzini, is a quote from William Buxton.

### 10 Big Software PM Time Wasters

Time management is extremely important for PMs. You want to focus your energy
on the activities that will have the highest leverage for your customers and
team. Over my career (as a software product manager)I’ve wasted a ton of time
doing things that felt high-leverage at the time, but didn’t produce lasting
value. Below I’ve listed the top ten culprits …

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*KnQtBXoI1-CgVmtOSyPMlQ.png)

**1 . Setting up elaborate systems to collect, track and reply to customer feature requests**. I very rarely see this produce value for either customers or teams. I’m not talking specific feedback and research, where you cast a focused net for something you are currently working on. And I’m not talking about lightweight feedback channels that you can query for background info, and even use to recruit customers for research. Rather, I’m talking about the pipe-dream that you’ll somehow open up the forum for feature requests, allow voting, and that this will somehow be helpful in roadmap prioritization. In the end, you just waste everyone’s time (including, most importantly, your customers). The volume of feedback just overwhelms the team’s ability to organize and act on the information.

**2\. Story Point Estimation**. I firmly believe in [cost of delay estimates](http://blackswanfarming.com/cost-of-delay/). And, I also believe that economic decisions require some sense of the investment necessary for a particular effort. The standard argument behind story point estimation is that it “triggers the right conversations” or “helps us not overcommit” or “helps us stock our sprint.” I think those end-goals (those conversations) are possible without the mind-numbing ritual. There are “good” reasons to estimate, and then a whole host of dysfunctional reasons. Spend more time on the value/outcome side and less time worrying about the difference between one and three day stories and t-shirt sizes.

**3\. Roadmap fire-drill**. I’m all for strategic thinking. I’m all for gathering data and describing some potential points on the horizon. Evolving your strategy should be a continuous activity. Unfortunately, that’s not how it works. Oh no … sales is feeling nervous about the current product and want a “roadmap” (translation, a list of things you will build that they will sell without promising, of course). Oh no … the CEO/founder is about to talk to the board and needs a “roadmap” (translation, all the sexy things that will attract their attention). Oh no … the CTO needs to staff up and make a yearly plan, so they want to know what you have in mind (e.g. need you to have a crystal ball). Here’s a better way. Always maintain a rolling 6 months, 12 months, and 2-year roadmap … not the features you’ll build, but the outcomes you’ll focus on. Don’t play defense. Play offense. Get people what they really need instead of outsourcing product strategy to the rest of the company.

**4\. Figuring out how to parallelize work and maximize work-in-progress**. PMs spend an inordinate amount of time figuring out ways to eek out every minute of developer coding time. “If we reduce the scope of this story, can you take on this other story as well?” “While we wait for feedback on that story, can you start these other three stories?” You’re wasting your time. You are getting too far into the weeds, and if getting that far into the weeds is going to determine your product’s success, you’ve got other things to worry about. So what if someone spends an afternoon refactoring or working down some debt? Is that the end of the world? What you’ll eventually learn is that the more you micro-manage their work, the more the team will optimize around retaining their sanity while being micro-managed. They will create their slack whether you like it or not. Stop playing Tetris with your team.

**5\. Horse-trading and auctioning the team’s resources**. “And 50% of our team will go to you, and 20% to you, and 15% each to these two other projects.” If you are finding yourself saying these things (or thinking these things), you’ll be fighting a big uphill battle for your product. It isn’t a product anymore! You are a project-shop. As a PM, imagine the world where the context and case you build would nullify all of this guessing. You’d make a case that would shut up all the guessing and requests, and people would say “damn, we’re excited for that … keep doing what you’re doing!” AND, you’d engage your team in that journey. I don’t think there is anything inherently wrong with a project-shop if you just call it out as such and call yourself a project manager.

**6\. Gathering information not applicable to your current initiative**. This is similar to #1, but it should be called out. PMs participate in countless meetings that generate information that is simply not actionable in the near-term. We’re told to be “responsive” and to “connect” with different parts of our organization, but again we’re wasting our time and the time of our internal stakeholders. Evangelism and maintaining relationships is important. So the key is to keep it pertinent and guide the conversation to the here-and-now.

**7\. Communicating to customers through proxie**s. Whenever possible, you need to go to the source. It’s not that other people (e.g. sales, marketing, customer support) are wrong or don’t provide useful information. Rather you’ll never get to ask the important questions, and you will waste other people’s time trying to get that information. Better yet your team should be there with you on the call. Never hesitate to get on the phone and talk to a customer.

**8\. Figuring it out in a small group**. God forbid the whole team attended a meeting and worked something out! No, instead we arrange “small meetings” to work things out. And then we decide on something, take it to the team, and only then realize that no one is on the same page. Sure, we may meet with a senior dev. And that might be “more efficient” and “less disruptive.” But how will your team ever get better at collaboration when things are a little messy? Again, we work too hard to keep things efficient and spend too little time investing in the resilience and overall performance of the team. Although I don’t think we do this consciously, I believe we try to keep ourselves relevant. These “important” small meetings achieve that.

**9\. Communicating status when the status hasn’t changed**. This behavior is often beyond our control, but as PMs, we spent lots of time telling people how/why things are on track even when nothing has fundamentally changed. Worse yet, we spend far more time communicating status than actually communicating results and outcomes. If all you do is communicate status, then that is all people will expect out of you.

**10\. Guessing and premature convergence**. Everyone is freaking out that they don’t have all the answers. You’re on the spot. What do you do … make shit up (consciously or unconsciously). We spend lots of time as PMs persuading people we have things figured out even when we don’t. That’s partially because they are risk averse. And that is partially because we create a conveyor belt of features and need to keep things rolling off the line. Instead of saying “hey, let’s get something in front of customers, and we can kill it if it doesn’t work” we say something like “ok, it looks like we all agree on the direction here, let’s ship it.” Consider how much time you invest keeping up the illusion that you know everything.

### Do You Ask For Story-Level Estimates?

Given the situation below, do you ask the team to estimate individual stories?
If so, why might you need story-level estimates? How would these story-level
estimates benefit you? If not, why are you comfortable not having story-level
estimates?

This is not a trick question. It could go either way. I’d love your feedback
in the comments.

### The (Fictional) Situation

  * B2B [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) vertical solutions provider for [SMBs](http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuareeves/2014/06/17/mission-incredible-the-rise-of-mission-based-smb-software/)
  * Latest [NPS survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter) shows a high concentration of “detractors” complaining about the lack of a particular capability. It is costing customers hours of manual work per month, and they are pissed. There are a range of solutions that may fulfill the need, but no clear winner
  * Detailed [customer exit interviews](https://www.groovehq.com/blog/exit-surveys) reveal that a growing percentage of customers choosing not to renew their annual contracts are doing so because of the lack of this capability
  * Existing customer interviews indicate that even longtime customers (who were once “promoters”) are considering leaving for a competitor if this issue is not addressed. Historical data on NPS surveys for this product show that a certain % of detractors will consistently churn
  * Sales is losing deals because this capability is missing, as evidenced by demo call transcripts and [“closed-lost” interviews](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-follow-up-with-closed-lost-opportunities)
  * The team believes ~$4,200,000 in existing recurring annual revenue is at risk (around 350 out of 10,000 customers), as well $69,230 per week in lost new ARR for new deals
  * The 350 customers are expected to leave over the next 6 months, so for _every week of delay _we estimate it will cost the company — between existing churned customers and lost new deals — $230,768 per week in lost revenue
  * The product development team (one of 20 such teams at the company) consists of 4 engineers, 1 UX, 1 PM, and 1 QA, and costs ~$20,000 every week
  * Team is able to ship code at will (multiple times weekly, if required)
  * Team has been stable for &gt;6 months and has experience delivering value to the persona in question (and ownership/familiarity with this area of the code). The team is savvy when it comes to decomposing stories, experimenting, validating assumptions,pivoting when required, and delivering
  * Supporting this type of feature also involves 1) training the support team $30,000, 2) updating marketing collateral $15,000, 3) training the sales team $30,000, 4) free customer training sessions $10,000, and 5) a couple of expensive C-level meetings $10,000. $95,000 in total
  * No extra infrastructure is required to support the feature
  * We ask a senior interaction designer, UX researcher, and lead engineer to take stock of the whole effort. Together, these three team members have a combined 50 years of experience with similar domains. They have a chat for fifteen minutes. The ID and researcher see some UX complexity and suggests the team might want to try a couple versions of the flow with real customers and a working version. The lead engineer doesn’t expect any surprises unless they hit a known limitation in the current API . Both agree that they would be surprised if it took &gt;5 months to successful iterate towards a viable solution (less than 10% chance). There are some potential solutions that could take as little as 3–4w. So somewhere between 4w and 5 months
  * The product development team participates in a “workshop” including 1) a [story-mapping exercise](http://jpattonassociates.com/story-mapping-quick-ref/), 2) interviewing visting customers and a review of the qualitative and quantitative data 3) a [design studio activity](https://zapier.com/blog/run-a-design-studio/) exploring different UX options, and 3) a review of the existing API to assess potential risks. This yields a couple possible directions, but again there is no clear winner

### Outcomes? We’re Programmed to Get into the Weeds

In response to my post on [feature factories](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-
youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2#.4mfv4tryz), a friend asked…

> How do I keep the team focused on outcomes?

Me: I’m guessing you do some kind of kick-off. At a certain point the
conversation shifts away from outcomes. Teams transition from talking about
outcomes to talking about tasks, phases, deliverables, and solutions. Our day-
to-day work centers around execution. What did you do yesterday? What is on
your plate today? Are we blocked? Are we on track? When can we ship? When can
we start on the next project?

None of this is inherently bad. This is what humans do … we break things down
into mini-projects and check things off of our list. After thinking briefly
about the _why _and _who, _we jump quickly to the _how _and _what. _The
problem is that we’re only exercising one muscle, and we stop asking
questions. We get stuck in the weeds. The team can outsource this thinking to
a PM or business stakeholder, but this weakens the muscle further.

Shipping feels good. Merging a PR feels good. Knowing what your next couple
weeks will look like feels good. Getting the deliverable to a downstream team
member feels good. And because this stuff feels good, it tends to be what we
optimize around. This holds true in especially tense and political
environments as well. Being able to say “we delivered on what you asked for”
will never get you into trouble, and it might be all that you can control.

In my experience, seeing that your work actually had impact rules the day and
feels VERY good. But in lieu of that, people want to feel (pretty) good. They
certainly don’t want to feel threatened, judged, or set up to fail.

Staying focused on outcomes is incredibly difficult, and often uncomfortable.
So is _experimentation_. Though it is popular to talk about experiments, I
rarely hear people tell me about _failed _experiment. Heck, in many
organizations simply getting _anything _done — let alone anything done quickly
enough to iterate and/or reflect on outcomes — is very challenging.

My point is that 1) we spend most of our time in the weeds, 2) it is
comfortable (and maybe even safer) in the weeds, 3) you need to get into the
weeds to get stuff done, 4) we structure our orgs (and work) around most
people being in the weeds, most of the time, and 5) the slower we move, the
more time we end up in the weeds. This is what you’re up against when trying
to take an outcome-focused approach. I’ve fallen into the trap of
underestimating just how deep these currents run.

You have to make a big concerted effort!

  * Make it safe to move quickly, receive feedback quickly, and change course quickly
  * Make it safe to set goals and miss the mark
  * Celebrate outcomes (not simply shipping), and celebrate learning
  * Align teams around missions/outcomes, not ship dates
  * Express your roadmap in terms of missions/outcomes (not features)
  * Spend time talking about and reviewing outcomes with your team
  * Describe your work in terms of desired outcomes
  * Get rid of tools that make it hard to see the “big picture”

… basically, be disciplined in the face of the overwhelming tendency to do
otherwise. Create rituals to keep you grounded. Dedicate time. Exercise the
muscle.
